4892,"huge project, romantic slices, plots, love, heroic scenes, battles and story of a queen as reflection of sacrifice spirit and love for country. a testimony of charming potential of South Asian cinema to give a different product by Bollywood. portrait of Thai XVI century, it is a beautiful jewelery, really impressive for each its part. This is a very appealing film for dreamy people easily stirred by beautifully exotic costumes, some compellingly exotic actresses and a few scenes of relentless brutality. This is a beautiful epic film set in historical Thailand during a turbulent period about 1526AD into the 1530's."
3213,"The family is brought back together when the Hair Dressing Championships come to their home town, and Phil, Shelley, Sandra and Brian pool their resources to beat their rivals. Heidi Klum also makes a special appearance, and sports some outrageous hairdos and costumes. Alan Rickman is good, sincere and has depth, Josh Hartnett has an okay delivery ruined by his trying - too - hard faux Yorkshire accent, and Bill Nighy is Bill Nighy, you'll always get a few laughs from him, but the real stars are Rachel Griffiths and Natasha Richardson. Young stars Josh Hartnett and the very adorable Rachael Leigh Cook are pleasant contributions to the film, with their brother - sister chemistry and secret adoration for one another. Bill Nighy is fantastic as the unscrupulous London artiste pulling out all the stops to win the Championship for an unprecedented third time, using his daughter, the insanely beautiful Rachel Leigh Cook, as his model."
4887,"The functional head of Anjo's gang while he's absent is an off - the - wall sadomasochist named Kakihara (Tadanobu Asano). Jijii is manipulating / grooming a bizarre killer named Ichi (Nao Omori), who is gradually taking out Anjo and Fujiwara gang members for him. But by the final "" act "", there are some very interesting revelations about characters and their relationships to one another. Miike goes so far that he criticizes women in Japan for their often seen submissive behavior by introducing a more independent persona with the character of Karen, a notably western influenced person, her need to cause pain nearly borders Kakihara's. The acting is surprisingly good - Nao Omori and Tadanobu Asano are impressive as Ichi and Kakihara."
3994,"Yet the best lines are good, such as when the emperor, disguised as a seaman, boards a ship and says, "" A position above decks would have been more appropriate. He has filled France with widows and orphans! "" There are truths there to make a revolution. When the film opens with the young son showing colored slides of the emperor's life on a primitive projector, you can feel the romance and the warmth for the rest of the film. When you wake with Napoleon on ship to see a stunning sunrise, you know Alessio Gelsini Torresi is a cinematographer worth watching."
3522,"There are a lot of sight gags and low brow humor in America's Sweethearts, and it is reported to bear a striking resemblance to Singin' In The Rain (although remains far inferior to that classic musical comedy), but it manages to keep the audience entertained if not hanging on every word. The supporting cast is dynamite, Seth Green, Hank Azaria, and Alan Arkin all have memorable and entertaining parts. Just like his role as the flamboyant butler in "" The Birdcage "" he brings out tons of laughs, taking on a phony accent. If you just want to kick back, have some good laughs, without having to kill any brain cells--curl up on the couch with your man or woman and watch "" America's Sweethearts . "" Ultimately, he and Roberts make Sweethearts worth watching--which is saying quite a lot."
3352,"The film wraps up quickly and ties together almost too neatly, but the ending fits the fast paced comic style of everything before it. Well, there were a couple of minor stretches--the catalyzing role of a sexual encounter in finally transforming M. Pignon's personality was one, but wouldn't that be quaintly Gallic? The film is pretty superficial and doesn't really delve into all the ramifications of it's storyline situation, but it does provide some easy laughs and some strong performances throughout. All the pieces fit together so intricately and well and so few liberties were taken of normal human reactions--almost everything was within comfortable bonds of believability."
3582,"The soundtrack is also terrific and the mandolin passages and vocals by the Italian soldiers are marvelous. The cinematography by John Toll (Cinematographer for Braveheart and Legends of the Fall, winning Oscars for both) is splendid. The cinematography of the beautiful exotic locations is breathtaking. It's possible to sing and be happy, have good feelings, to love and to be loved in a War time! Working with Madden, the choices for locations on the Greek island of Kefallonia are superb and the visual images that come from photographing these majestic locations in varying light are lush and beautiful."
3837,"The colors were exquisite, the music and dancing delightful and the people gorgeous. Talented portrayals of deep complex characters who can make you laugh and cry in just minutes. A large family spread all over the world reunites for the big event and all the ties and feelings between siblings, cousins, parents, friends are shown and expressed in a light but touching way. Very refreshing as there are no super stars, no blood, no perfect special effects, no sex. At one point, Lalit and Dubey argue over the wedding tent; should it be white, the modern (Western) way, or should it be colorful?"
3581,"Movies like this are rare, but making a come - back. Another great independent horror film, "" May "", is also suffering from poor reviews by people who don't seem to really understand what they're watching, and react angrily to that. Session 9 is a welcome return to the type of film whose horror relies not on cheap - thrill multi-decibel glissandos, jump - cuts and viscera (although it has its share of that), but on strong interplay between characters, and the gradual realisation that the worst things you can imagine are not "" out there "", but inside your own mind. That said, this is still a disturbing, powerful film with scenes which will stay with you for a long time. While many (including the filmmakers) will find comparisons to Don't Look Now, The Shining, and even a nod to The Changeling, Session 9 still stands on its own as a most effective, brooding experience of dread--and that's a good thing!"
3580,"The clever dialogue (always peppered with underlying angst) is PERFECT for Cillian Murphy's character. Eastenders Vicky still comes to mind - but only as a resemblance of her image. Jonathan's' battle' of wits against the passive Dr. Figure, and whole structure of the institute is very witty, intelligent, and reveals a great deal about both. Rea's subtle style of acting is perfect for the role of Dr. Figure. The characteristic intake of deep breathes in sync with his raised eyebrows, Stephen Rea carries his passive, calm, role and acts very much as a mirror for the cast."
3212,"Get over it is a cute no brainer that has some good one liners, funny musical numbers, and clever direction. This is a likeable musical that not only teens will enjoy. The chemistry between the two leads â€“ Kirsten Dunst and Ben Foster â€“ is very believable and although predictable, the love story is well put - together and generally likeable. Ben Foster is a strong newcomer and Kirsten Dunst once again proves she is the queen of teen movies, although she better lose that angle soon or she'll be up for Prom Queen once more! Berke is Helped and Hindered by his friends along the way leading to some hilarious scenes."
4008,"The performances are neat and unshowy, with Catherine Keener reliable as ever as (another) wayward hard - ass, Mulroney playing the roguish fool and Jake Gyllenhaal practising for the role he plays in The Good Girl. Nicole Holofcener achieved the same effect in Walking & Talking, which had the same' effortless' feel to it, and the always - wonderful Catherine Keener is in both, as well. Nicole Holofcener's small output prevents making any kind of assumption as yet, but in "" Lovely and Amazing "" she displays remarkable ability in dealing with the pain people (mostly female) experience in grappling with the issue of self esteem. Director Nicole Holofcener, who also wrote the script, projects a sense of balance that brings each character's life into sharp and absorbing focus. Holofcener has produced a genuinely lovely film; one that portends amazing things yet to come."
3579,"Isolated by snow - covered mountain tops, ponderosa pines, and upper class wood homes, this is the perfect backdrop for The Deep End. The photography, by Giles Nuttgens, won the coveted Best Cinematography Award at the Sundance Film Festival this year for its unflinching look at images of Lake Tahoe awash in moral tensions. The camera cuts through aquariums, dripping water faucets, bursting water bottles, and of course, across and beneath the lake's surface. Someone might know the truth behind this act of violence, but silence has a very high price tag. McGehee and Siegel adapted their screenplay from the novel ` The Blank Wall,' by Elisabeth Sanxay Holding, and it's a taut thriller, to be sure; but it is so singular of purpose that it decidedly becomes more of a character study that focuses on Margaret, and the effects of that natural bond between mother and son that provides the catalyst for her motivation and the impetus of her actions."
3588,"This is a tremendously entertaining film that shouldn't be viewed as a horror film, but rather, as a tongue - in - cheek western, in the vain of the Spaghetti Westerns. But if you like great b - movies, go see this movie. This is a movie for people who like fun, enjoyable movies - it's simple, unpretentious, full of intentional cliches, and even creepy at times. Sometimes you want a deep film, sometimes you want escapism and a few shocks and thrills. Ghosts of Mars fits the bill perfectly."
4902,"Done in good taste that reflects the boy - scout best of the 50's genre, the movie is unlike anything else that Hollywood or indies are putting out. 10/10 rating Lost Skeleton of Cadavra is a remarkable little film that recreates the look and feel of old low - budget black and white sci fi films, but it has a refreshing spirit all its own that is smart and silly at the same time. Lost Skeleton is fun in its own right because it takes the archetypes of sci fi and its clichÃ©'s and mixes them together to make something that is more entertaining than straight parody. In short, it is an incredibly accurate and funny send - up of 50's drive - in movies. You just need to have the right - minded folks at the keyboard and behind and in front of the camera, and "" Lost Skeleton "" has it."
3797,"This must be one of the greatest movies of all time. The use of body language is tremendous, the light setting perfect, everything well timed and perfectly captured by the camera. This is one of the most perfect movies of all time, and it deserves anything it can get. This German - Expressionist film had such originality in everything from its costumes to its views of a future (modern) city that its ideas can still be seen everywhere in modern sci - fi. Star Wars's C - 3PO was based on Bridgette Helm's robot."
3578,"Besides, Eli loved Planet Of The Apes memorabilia and that's a nice change from the usual cliched obsessions. The performances are nicely turned and Ruccolo is charming in his part, as is Doris Roberts, who ultimately makes the biggest impression even though she is only on - screen for about 15 minutes. It is not as goofy as "" The Opposite of Sex "" (written by this film's Executive Producer, Don Roos), but it has a lot of great laughs. All Over The Guy is a film that breaks the barriers and focuses on issues of intimacy and finding ways to communicate--and it's a big shame it didn't get the major distribution it deserves as it is right on the mark and so much more enjoyable than the endless line of circuit boy romances being released. Good moments from Christina Ricci, and Doris Roberts was perfect (wow, can she cuss too!)"
3577,"As they rob railroad payrolls and bedevil the authorities, Jesse, Frank, and their gang get something besides revenge: they become authentic American legends. Legend and folklore have cast him as a Robin Hood, a good boy forced by circumstances to follow a criminal life. Ali Larter is nice eye candy as Jesse's lady love, but the story really gives her nothing to do, and while Dalton growls impressively behind a grungy - looking beard, he doesn't really get the chance to do anything evil. American Outlaws isn't a bad film, it's not really a great one either but it is worth a look. They must, because whether it be at point blank range with a pistol, or with a Gatling gun during a Civil War battle, they just can seem to want to hurt this guy."
4016,"Director / writer / co-star Yvan Attal is actually married to co-star Charlotte Gainsbourg, an effervescent and shimmering bilingual (French / English) beauty. Stamp brings a bemused actor's attempts at dalliance to life. There are amusing scenes, the best being when Charlotte negotiates with her frenetic director for terms on which to appear naked in a scene. In real life happy endings to episodes of mounting distrust, approaching paranoia, are few. With good art, excellent camera work, and solid performances, this half English, half French flick makes for a nominal subtitled watch best saved for broadcast."
4021,"It's a languid and tempestuous poem of a movie, told in a non-linear way by the extremely ambitious Julio Medem. Medem understands all this very well, and his depiction of it is remarkable. Paz Vega and Tristan Ulloa are stunning as the two leads - Vega with her fierce intelligence and Ulloa with his tormented vulnerability. The three main actors (Paz Vega, TristÃ¡n Ulloa, Najwa Nimri) of the movie are really good and carry the entire movie. The camera - work and colors are really great and create a very unique atmosphere for the movie."
3576,"The characters and backgrounds are allowed to look and move in ways that are downright refreshingly bizarre. It's fun to watch how the pill and blood cell travel to different parts of the body. Granted, not the funniest movie ever by typical "" guffaw standards "", but certainly one of the most clever. this movie is even good for adults. Still, it might be a worthwhile movie, more for kids than adults, but it it watchable for all."
3575,
5800,"In this film you really get an insight into the mind of a paranoid schizophrenic (played brilliantly by Daniel BrÃ¼hl - he deserves every award that he got already or will get in the future), because it is so well researched that it appears 100% authentic (the director studied neurology). At first everything is going fine; they spend their days taking drugs and having fun, but when he abandons his university studies on the first day just because he can't find the enrolment office and when a date with a girl goes a little bit wrong; -) the audience begins to suspect that there's something wrong with Lukas. Katharina SchÃ¼ttler in her small role is as good as always. Director Hans Weingartner makes great usage of Dogma - style camera and avoids all movie clichÃ©s. "" Das weiÃŸe Rauschen "" or "" The White Sound "" is a German 100 - minute movie from 15 years ago and one of the movies that won lead actor Daniel BrÃ¼hl a German Film Award that year."
3565,"Like the previous film, this first of what will undoubtedly be a long line of lucrative sequels combines sardonic humor with eye - popping martial arts action sequences to entertaining effect. The split - second perfection of these scenes, combined with the balletic grace with which they are executed, makes him one of the truly unique talents working in movies today. Rush Hour 2 is a fun, lightweight action film suitable for teens on up. He plays his character like a Chinese Chris Walken and, along with Ziyi Zhang, his beautiful but psychotic partner, provides a nice dramatic balance to the lunatic Tucker and straight - man Chan. Zhang Ziyi is a perfect complement to this couple."
3564,"A fun story - if entirely unoriginal - about an awkward and unpopular 15 year old San Francisco girl (Anne Hathaway) who discovers out of the blue that she is the heir to the throne of the small, fictional European principality of Genovia, and has to deal with all the adjustments that requires."
3563,"Perhaps this apparent smoke screen of an issue caused Angelina Jolie's (often chapped and super-pouty) lips to be sealed regarding her role in the movie. Equally intoxicating were the use of nontraditional cinematography and sound techniques. * out of **** Ah, the erotic thriller, a genre that now mostly exists in the form of straight - to - video or made - for - cable TV releases. But there are always the occasional theatrical releases, such as Basic Instinct (great sex scenes, sporadically interesting story), Bound (steamy sex scenes, good plot, Jennifer Tilly is annoying as hell), Wild Things (dull sex scenes, fun plot twists), and Color of Night (ludicrous story, but features one of the best sex scenes in mainstream cinema!) These twists give some great scenes of power for Banderas and Jolie to work off of, plus a excellent amount of sex and nudity from Jolie and a good feeling for the movie throughout."
3585,"One of the least recognized film jewels of the century so far. When watching movies late at night this one is a funny one to check out. It adds amusing scenes with naive love. With the culmination of all the parties getting to the wedding when he gets there, finding out he's (gasp) got * immunities * all along, and his exit with Pappy, Pippy, and Poonanny makes Bubble Boy a hilarious comedy that is great for you late nighters. The film's certainly not for all tastes, but will appeal to people who've liked John Waters' films from the past decade."
4033,"The film builds around this couple and the explosive crescendo that seems imminent from the opening scenes. Its succession of slick, fast - talking, emotional roller coaster scenes is a beautiful thing to watch. ' The Last Kiss' is a beautiful Italian film, a romantic comedy and drama told in multiple storylines reminiscent of' Magnolia' or' Short Cuts'. In one side is Carlo, played beautifully by Stefano Accorsi, and his friends. This film, which Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called "" Sex in the City with men "", garnered tons of 3 1/2 and 4 star reviews, hit dozens of Top Ten Lists, and will easily become a favorite for those who are lucky enough to see it."
3269,"^_^ The script is phenomenal, filled with many in - jokes and great timely references. Sure, it was campy, but it garnered genuine and consistent laughs from the audience. The laughs are infectious while the sweetness - versus - evil plot is guaranteed to provide a venue to help you forget your worries and make you smile, smile, smile. The costumes, needless to say, are just what a fashion loving female would admire. Girls will love it, yes, and the guys will love the chance to see three beautiful gals on celluloid."
3529,"However, it is fun to see the return of the bad haircuts, too - short shorts, and high socks that made up that era, along with some great early 80s rock hits. This spoof of summer camp movies from the 70's and 80's does a great job of recreating the implausible and predictable plots of the movies of the ear while still staying incredibly funny and fresh. In this time when parodies are almost more common than original ideas, this movie stands out as one of the best."
3355,"Sure the plot is a bit much--cats are trying to prevent a Mr. Brody from inventing a vaccine which will cure dog allergies--thus making dogs more popular than cats. Especially, good is the voice of the persian cat, Mr. Twiggles, whose owner is bedridden. The cats of course, are worried about this, because the cure of the allergy would make dogs even more popular among humans, making the cats rejected. This is a stylish and extremely witty parody that has the cat world fighting for world domination and to see dogs put in their place, outside in the doghouse, where humans would, as is the cat's goal, be allergic to the canine breed and thus welcoming the feline race into their homes. This is a high octane fun and friendly family movie that is built around the life of young Scotty (Alexander Pollock) and his scientist father (Jeff Goldblum) who whilst working too hard at trying to make a breakthrough for a cure to prevent dog allergies in humans."
3261,"This is one of those rare gems â€“ a truly funny film. Granted, "" Tomcats "" has more energy than laughs, and the story is predictable in the extreme; however, it works by mixing in some sweetness along with the vulgarity, and it certainly helps that Jerry O'Connell and Shannon Elizabeth have a nice chemistry together - you get the feeling they would make a likable pair. "" Tomcats "" is not the best of the gross - out comedies, but it delivers. Luckily, the copious laughs made up for the extreme crudeness. Better yet, one of the most disgusting moments in the history of motion pictures."
3356,"Here he plays a good character as well as being given plenty of good fights to show how technically able he is. At times the dialogue is a bit heavy and there are a few moments where the film is a bit talky for a bit long without any of it coming to a great deal but mostly it is pretty enjoyable. The action was great especially the final scenes. However one of the final fighting scenes with Liu taking on a whole class of Black belts is hilarious, as you know he is going to win. But despite its few formulaic shortcomings, Kiss of the Dragon still delivers."
4040,"Given that so much effective use is made of varying sound levels to convey Carla's hearing with and without her two hearing aids--turned up, turned down, or removed--the musical background score in non-nightclub scenes is obtrusive. This works especially well for those who do not speak French since the distraction of having to follow the subtitles is kept to a minimum. It is pleasing to note that the usual thriller plot contrivances are kept to a minimum here, and the surprises really are surprises. See this for Emmanuelle Devos whose skill and offbeat charisma more than make up for a lack of glamor, and for Vincent Cessel for a testosterone - filled performance so intense one can almost smell the leather jacket. For Audiard character development and delineation are more important than action, yet the action is extremely tense."
3526,"The original 1968 film of' Planet of the Apes' is one of cinema's great science fiction classics. An astronaut from Earth travels to a planet ruled by intelligent apes. In the original film, the apes are the only intelligent and articulate beings on the planet. That film was advertised with the slogan' Somewhere in the Universe, there must be something better than man! ' , and the apes are indeed, in some respects, better than man."
3324,"If you like Rob Schneider films such as Deuce Bigalow, The Hot Chick, Benchwarmers, then most likely you will enjoy this film, if you hated those films you will definitely hate this one because it is probably the worst out of those four. This was just plain funny and very entertaining throughout the goofy 83 minutes. Have a few beers and perhaps you will enjoy it."
4047,"The script, word for word, and moment for moment, is as perfectly judged as one of Martha's dishes. Lina comes to the restaurant kitchen in the evenings, becoming a darling there, while Mario becomes a family friend and Lina's buddy, and the three look just like a family. As in similar movies, just after the mid-point, when characters are well developed and things go nicely, conflicts occur. Director / writer Sandra Nettelbeck deserves praise for bringing this joyous piece to the screen. Why are European movies so much better than American films at showing sexiness and desirability in 30 - or 40 - something year - old women?"
3613,"If you've never seen a movie before--if you've never HEARD of movies--you'll probably find this one engaging. Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd and Diane Lane are great as the Terrence and Erin Glass, and even Trevor Morgan gives a nice performances as Ruby's younger brother, Rhett Baker. "" The Glass House "" does have some suspenseful moments but taken as a whole, there are simply to many contrived moments and people doing stupid things because they have to to further the plot to make this a truly enjoyable or worthwhile thriller. Stellan's character was completely chilling, and he played it so effectively. Everyone delivered their lines and completed scenes with finesse, even if they weren't Oscar worthy presentations and they created the atmosphere that the director was trying to set perfectly."
3392,"Add to this a rich amount of influences from the FF games, including eight mysterious spirits that must be found in time or the heroine will succumb, as well as a lot of mythological references that must be taken for granted rather than analysed to bits if the viewer is to find any pleasure in this film. The average sci - fi movie fan, though, who ought to have loved the wicked general (excellently voice - cast by James Woods) and his huge space cannon, as well as the' Aliens' styled surroundings and technology, was put off by all the talk about spirits and world souls. It works well, especially if you like Asian movies. The detail level of vehicles and scenery is superb, you can even see dust falling as the light streams in a window, this gives you an idea of how detailed it can be. For a movie based on a video game, Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within was very good."
3639,"The most interesting aspects of the story are Bobby Garfield and his relationship with his mother, girlfriend and Ted. He looks like the young Elijah Wood, with the same angelic blue eyes, and he's truly captivating. So let's all rent / buy this wonderful film, and boost that IMDb score. Hopkins is great as usual, as is the boy, Anton Yelchin and the latter has a great career ahead of him. The kids - Anton Yelchin and Mika Bororem - are good, especially Yelchin, who has a far bigger role."
3357,"It's just a good rated R movie with spoofs for all tastes; of course, if you are not easily offended. For example, when entering the room for the first time, he gets scared and runs away when Reagan turns her head on 180Âº; and the always effective vomiting cycle. Definitely a movie to watch if you want some good amusing immature fun with over the top acting and great gags. Several other cast members make the film enjoyable and the gags are hilarious. Ferris, Hall and Marlon Wayans all once again completely steal the film, but new additions Cross and Elliott also have some amazing writing and scenes."
4052,"This film is just the third work of the director, Ryosuke Hashiguchi, who continues to shoot marvelous films, which, certainly, have something to do with homosexuality quite casually, and most importantly, quite naturally. Hashiguchi's film is also touching as he explores the many road blocks encountered in contemporary society by a lonely gay couple wishing to start a family (child adoption is not an option). Nice performances and a nice soothing sound track (with just a little Japanese twist). "" Hush "" is a dramedy out of Japan which swirls around a handful of young adults including a couple of gay men and a female who wants to have a baby by one of them. The film deals with familial relationships now, and as such presents a refreshing and forward thinking outlook on the nature of the family unit in the 21st century."
3805,"According to David's friend Alphonse (Phonse in the local shorthand, and played by Andy Jones, a Newfoundland writer / actor / comic) it's because David hasn't done a proper marketing job, because certainly he has the gourmet skills, as well as a fabulous wine cellar. To revive interest in the restaurant, Phonse hatches (almost literally) a scheme to attract bird - watchers to the area by claiming a sighting of a duck long thought to have been extinct - putatively the "" rare bird "" of the title, although one suspects that the real "" rare birds "" are Phonse and David themselves. There are several comic sub-plots in the film, the best of which is Phonse's RSV, the "" recreational submarine vehicle "" that he has constructed in his shed and which he recruits David to assist him in dive - testing. The love interest in the film, Alice, who is introduced to the married but separated David by Phonse, is played by the talented and lovely Molly Parker ("" Sunshine "", and the soon to be released "" Hoffman ""). He does a kind of "" loaves and fishes "" miracle with the material at hand, making a near - banquet out of a box - lunch."
4053,"But those who enjoy an intelligent exploration of relationships at a deep even profound level will find this movie to their liking. In this reflection, his father appears at his elegant home and the rest of the film explores the son's complex relationship and emotions relative to what he believes these might be, should his father actually show up. with special kudos to Michael Bouquet and Charles Berling, the leads. It's also one of those typically French films where everyone is beautiful and the drama proceeds by the subtlest of inflexion. These two climaxes occur so close together that maximum impact is definitely achieved."
3395,"Although there were some parts of the movie that seemed over dramatized, it captures the violent and self destructive lifestyle American teens are exposed to, and the story is very well told and acted. This is a sad, realistic look at how many teenagers really do act with their peers. Overall, Bully is a great, if uncomfortable roller coaster of a movie, and it is therefore recommended to those that want to see movies that break the Hollywood mould, and movie fans in general. Nick Stahl plays Billy, bully among a circle of teenage friends in Hollywood, Florida, and his best friend from childhood is Marty, played with striking intensity by Brad Renfro, has been daily receiving torment, if not with punches and slaps, then more on the mental side. With none of your usual Hollywood gloss and a well selected cast (especially Stahl in a creepy performance), this film has many powerful moments and completely draws you into it's story."
4064,"It's smart and fascinating, surprise - a-minute crime film that's held together with a great line of unknown talent. In comparison with Black - urban action flicks, this is almost right up there with Hype Williams overlooked masterpiece, Belly. In fact, in comparison with most rap - movies (ex: anything by Master P, or Dame Dash) this is Oscar worthy (in comparison, of course). In this movie, you get to see nellys ass when he gets out of the shower, so if you are from norway, you will really, really, really love this movie. Zoe Saldana is gorgeous as always and a very good actress."
5696,"At one point, the suicides evolve from their initial spirit of a unifying pact to a fad to be indiscriminately mimicked, whether one does it alone or not. It is significant that Sono shows many suicide victims with interlocked hands, achieving a kind of emotional / spiritual / "" kamic "" unity before taking the plunge. The police are mystified - the body count is rising and no particular connection between the victims is apparent. Later he becomes a self - styled Charles Mansion - ish celebrity, and he is blamed for having a connection to the suicides, in a typical media / pop culture scapegoating."
3306,"See them reprise the' flypast and debriefing' scenes from Top Gun. Watch Jon Voigt recreate Peter Sellars' unforgettable character Dr. Strangelove. Waste of talent: Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Alec Baldwin, and Jennifer Garner are given relatively minor roles in the film. He was one of two pilots who got into fighter planes and began engaging & shooting down Japanese planes. The major male stars, Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett, along with Producer Jerry Bruckheimer were interviewed by one of the hosts of this TV morning news show."
3211,"It has some excellent writing and some top - notch acting performances. In many respects, it suffers horribly from being predictable, although there were instances where it strayed sharply from the "" rules "" of formulaic movies. Through creative camera angles, many of the bloodiest scenes are only obscurely hinted at, leaving the audience to fill in the pieces. Not surprisingly, many entertainment reviewers disliked the movie, because it has the effect of exposing some of the more negative effects of the media. This movie may not be saying anything original, but it is sufficiently entertaining and thought - provoking to make it worth seeing."
3210,"Recommended if you love or hate Reality TV shows, the film is set as back to back episodes of series 7 of The Contenders, an American show where the current champion and five randomly selected challengers have to kill or be killed - and the winner gets to appear in the next series. But the film's brilliant craftsmanship wouldn't be nearly as effective without the power of the fine cast's performances, particularly Brooke Smith; her riveting performance makes Dawn the emotional center of SERIES 7: THE CONTENDERS. Set in the near future, SERIES 7 is cleverly constructed as a marathon of seventh - season episodes of "" The Contenders, "" a hit reality show in which contestants are selected via state lotteries and given guns with which they're expected to hunt down and kill their fellow contestants (although they're free to use their own weapons and be inventive). Trapped in the program for the past two seasons, Dawn's reluctantly willed herself into becoming a frighteningly efficient killing machine to keep herself and her unborn baby alive. The champ is Dawn Lagarto (Brooke Smith of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS), a pregnant, troubled but essentially decent drifter."
4071,"Briefly, the lives of a successful novelist, bereft of her only child who has just died in a fall, and her mad mother, intersect with those of another mother, a barmaid, who neglects and abuses her child, another little boy, and her taciturn boyfriend. Luck Mervil, who plays Carole's boyfriend, is restrained like a volcano that one knows will eventually go off; and Stephane Freiss, who plays the father of the dead boy, and Edouard Baer who plays a scheming lower - class gigolo, are two very real varieties of men who prey on women. Miller has given a fresh coat to the frequent cinema theme of casual interactions through the interconnectedness of the characters' lives as revealed by sharply etched encounters. Betty is ambiguously played by Sandrine Kiberlain, which in a way, suits the character better. Given that Betty Fisher herself ends the film about to start a completely new life, anything could happen."
3305,"Visually it is superb, an indulgent feast for the eyes with every breathtaking, artistic scene. Everything about it is over the top, every scene more stunning than the next, and as it continues your heart becomes more and more intertwined in the love story. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGreggor are the most passionate on - screen couple; entirely convincing as their voices meld them together into one. It pushes against the confines of convention and leaves you breathless. Of a young man named Christian, a penniless writer, and a singer named Satine, who for a moment came together and tasted the nectar of the gods."
4085,"Acts of humiliation present a violent and effective method for stripping individuality and asserting power over prisoners. The psychological transformations into masochistic and submissive roles are fascinating when you consider that that the only real distinguishable difference between the characters, is that by a random selection process, some are labeled' wardens' and others are labeled' prisoners'. This film is a sensitive study into power relationships within an altered reality and is masterfully crafted to build tension and invite the viewer to question the character's morality and ethical codes. The guards want to impose their dominion on the prisoners. This movie is amazing: just released on DVD in Brazil, it is certainly one of the best films of the year."
5693,"The story is basically about five high school boys who decide to learn synchronized swimming, influenced by the new coach of their school's swimming team, Sakuma; An attractive young woman that is into synchro swimming. With the Tadano High's summer festival coming very soon, every club from the school is preparing a special event on their own. Five adorable and well - meaning misfits at a Japanese high school try to organize a synchronized swimming team, but their early efforts at a routine end in disaster. It's a Japanese comedy about a group of male synchronised swimmers - how cool is that! They have a few disasters before actually getting to the synchro performance, you watch the friendships build and good things finally happening for the misfits."
5692,"Both college students, the clumsy, laid back Gyeon - woo and "" The Girl "", a whimsical tomcat, make for one interesting couple for the main characters. And everything that they encounter throughout the film magically comes together in the end, and it's truly heartwarming. - it surely is different from the other films that you've watched lately - the actors are young and they love playing, not like the spoiled Hollywood "" wunderkinds "" - it's funny - it's realistic / with real emotions and problems of the young people - no matter whether they are in Asia, Europe, or America / - at least for this short time, you can feel something of the culture. What sets this movie apart from others is how the second half of the film, which consists of pure melodrama, is connected to the first half. George Winston's rendition of' Pachelbel's Canon in D' invokes a very romantic and joyous feeling that is indeed felt in the scene where Gyeon - Woo gives the girl a rose during her class (at an all - girls school) while she was playing the piano."
3342,"Disney, the film name that once stood for all things innocent and suitable for all ages, has finally started to realise that to survive it needs to become more diverse. If you want epic levels of detail in the plot, turn to James Cameron's "" Titanic "". You have your leading hero and heroine, backed up by more than half a dozen crew members who go on the expedition, all being given their moments during the film. Numerous other characters appear, take up the few minutes of screentime, then disappear. The CGI animation is truly amazing in places, and doesn't dwarf the characters, which was a flaw that let the recent "" Titan A. E. "" down."
4089,"Not afraid to cast people who just have pure feelings, no plastic acting - by - the - book moves and more than one and a half expressions on their faces. When he gets hired at a varietÃ© in Berlin, he finds himself confronted with the Nazis, his strange employer Jan Hanussen, played by the impressive Tim Roth, who wants to sell him off as Siegfried, a blond, germanic hero who can even lift an elephant. It involves a dream of Zishe's (played by near unknown Jouko Ahola in a mostly one - note performance) where he walks around on a rocky beach. He is surrounded by bright red crabs, and steps around on the rock trying not to knock them down or get snipped by their claws. This dream occurs again towards the end of the film, as his younger brother leads him by the hand through the crabs on the rocks, somehow giving him strength."
3593,""" OK, "" She continues, "" and a person who speaks 2 languages? "" She zings a question: "" What do you call a person who speaks several languages? "" Better than the ordinary Hollywood movie, this family comedy does a very nice job of presenting a variety of characters in the throes of pursuing their own version of the American Dream. The camera loves the food being prepared, the Latin - flavored music score enlivens the proceedings, and the acting is quite serviceable. Jacqueline Obrador and Elizabeth Pena shine as the older daughters in the family, the always - reliable Hector Elizondo is fine in a rare leading role."
4091,"A hallmark of a good storyteller is making the audience empathise or pull them into the shoes of the central character. The uplifting scene where she cleanses the River God is accompanied by stirring music and is as exciting as watching gladiatorial combatants fight. Of course, by giving the audience developed characters to care about, the action and conflicts will always be more exciting, terrifying and uplifting than normal, generic action scenes. Through Chihiro, Miyazaki is clearly (but non-patronisingly) talking to youth of Japan. That The Last Samurai had to be filmed in New Zealand to get a turn of the century Japanese look speaks volumes."
5684,Ferch's performance as the swimming champion and former prisoner Harry Melchoir is outstanding. One in particular is Fritizi returning to dig the tunnel so soon after her suicide attempt.
3209,"This was a very pleasant surprise; a very good comedy filled with a lot of laughs and - more surprise - not much raunch and profanity. There are many comic moments when the two hit men (the only two creatures in the film uglier than Agent 11) bicker amongst themselves about this assignment which is beneath their dignity, and worry that if their friends ever find out they will never live it down and will be humiliated for the rest of their lives. Hopelessly in love with her (which shows such appalling lack of taste) is the highly amusing David Arquette, who has the advantage of having a touch of that attractive wistful look of his sister Rosanna. Arquette is a wildly wacky, hopelessly disorganised young free spirit who lives in a pig - sty, and has little in the way of financial prospects. The girl in the tight skirt has to go away for a few hours and leaves her little boy with Arquette, with the greatest trepidation because she considers him irresponsible, but she will be back soon enough and she risks it."
5683,"Mantle at the time was the darling of NY Yankee fans and was probably the greatest player of his day, Maris was a small town boy who played the game only as a means to an end, to provide for his family, and cared little for public opinion or the press. The film is rounded of by an appearance during the credits by Mickey Mantle's son and grandson, pure class and a tribute to the boyhood idol of Billy Crystal All in all well done to Billy Crystal and cast. Thank you for a wonderful 2 hrs and 9 mins. Barry Pepper and Thomas Jayne play Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle who went on a dual chase that year for that most sacred of all records. Sacred because it had been set by a man who revolutionized the game itself and was one of the most colorful sports personalities that America ever produced."
5680,"Four snotty rich kids at a prep school in England want to get out of a field trip to Wales, where they would have to eat "" fish paste sandwiches "" and be otherwise uncomfortable. If you're someone who only likes straightforward plots, traditionally happy endings and films depicting "" facts "" that are close to what you believe to be true about the actual world, you're best advised to avoid The Hole. If you instead do not mind, or even prefer, circuitous, twisted tales with strong fantasy elements (in this case primarily to enable what amounts to a parable) and fairly nihilistic endings, you may find much to love here. Stemming from this, it's easy to see that the performances are quite good. They all seem to have an attitude that their intellect is far superior to almost every one else, and thus they're entitled to whatever they desire, as well as justified in whatever it takes to get it--that's a classic disposition of many criminals, and not a few business leaders, politicians, Internet geeks and so on."
5686,"Adding more details along with the well developed on the movie, the deeds were happened of the following manner: The meeting took place in the Berlin suburb of Grossen - Wannsee, where the decision was made to adopt the Final Solution, the contemplated extermination of Jews. The Jews capable of work will be brought these areas for road building, in which task undoubtedly a large number will fall through natural diminution. The ` inevitable' being the spiralling problem of the huge numbers of Jews and how best to deal with them. The cast also includes great turns by Colin Firth, a lawyer and professor who thinks the systematic slaughter of the Jews is bad for Germany's future, and Ian McNiece, who plays a hateful and witty official. The are no cartoon Nazis here, the depiction of Heydrich is fascinating and complex: the man is urbane, witty, impeccably mannered and utterly devoid of morality."
3525,"And Hedwig and the Angry Inch's (that's the band's name as well as the film's) appearance outside the Menses Festival next to the port - o - potties. Already the winner of numerous awards including the Audience and Director awards at Sundance, this is the film of an original stage musical comedy that played off Broadway for over two years. Loaded with songs that you will be humming all the way out of the cinema, Hedwig and the Angry Inch is the funniest, most outrageously entertaining movie of its kind since Rocky Horror. Unlike Rocky Horror, it does have some more serious philosophical reflections built into it (mostly via the songs), but it rocks, kicks ass and injects some seriously funny pizzaz into the transgender scene. On the down - side, the film is probably better on second or third viewing, when all the pieces would fit into place, and towards the end there is a tendency to tell the story only in songs and so at the expense of any serious script writing."
3608,"More real than American Beauty, more honest than Ghost World, less sleazy than Kids or Happiness, L. I. E. is a tender and thoughtful, often funny, examination of the lives of suburban teens who are without guidance or adult role models and who must develop inner strength simply in order to survive. One of their escapades takes them to the house of Big John Harrigan (brilliantly performed by Scottish actor Brian Cox), a macho ex-marine well known in the neighborhood as a chickenhawk (for those uninitiated, an individual with a predilection for sex with young men). In portraying Big John, first time director, Michael Cuesta resists moralizing and courageously defies stereotyping. This movie has caused some consternation in some quarters because it shows a sexual predator as a complex human being with feelings. The actor who played Big John was exceptional."
5340,"They made good use of that figure, with sometimes disturbing, but very well done fight scenes and in general, beautiful cinematography. About seven centuries ago, Chinese got divided and a diplomatic mission from the Koryo kingdom (protected by small group of soldiers), try to make peace with the Ming dynasty. A special mention deserves the numerous war scenes. You will really believe that you've been transported back to 400 something AD China, where Zhang Ziyi happens to be a princess and Yu Rong Guang a Mongol general. To provide suitable contrast between the moments of combat, he relates them in short, effective, dialogue scenes."
4601,"Chiyoko Fujiwara: even her names evokes 1, 000 years of Japanese history beginning with the Fujiwara clan who dominated Japan a millennium ago as she dominated Japanese movies. At one moment the cameraman is making a pungent comment about cornball emotions, and the next moment he is dodging burning arrows from one of her movies. They met just briefly, he gave her the key to "" the most important thing in the world, "" and Chiyoko and the film characters she plays spend the next 1, 000 years and the rest of her film career and the rest of her life trying to return it. Live - action could not possibly have created this stunning plunge though the centuries nearly as well, nor have depicted the transformation of a beautiful young women into a beautiful old woman. She continues undaunted even though the wheel of her curse keeps turning and is symbolized by increasingly modern modes of transportation: carriages, trains, bicycles; the splendor and tragedy of Japanese history whizzes by and still her journey continues."
3643,"Amusing for adults, a blast and a half for pre-puberty members of the family, Max Keeble is just good junior high fun. Maybe the characters are unidimensional but at least, they pick the right people for the job: the director is ridiculous, Amber is a sexy science teacher, and the terror of teens in the Shameless show is indeed the terror of the playground! As many such files the kids are very smart and clever while all the adults are totally inept. Like the above mentioned Parker Lewis, it's exactly the thing here and around this, there is really a plot: everything can explode as the boy leaves town but he must finally be responsible after all! And Max earns respect not because he's the toughest, but because his turnabout beats the bullies at their own game, and because he won't let his buddies take the rap alone."
5320,"also filled with philosophical questions and ruminations). When this thought - inspiring film finally is released to theaters or video, don't miss it. Not just another war movie, To End All Wars takes the true story of Ernest Gordon and veteran Argyle soldiers to the screen in a way that will turn your heart inside out. It's a breath of fresh air because it makes some strong statements about morality and forgiveness, and is written beautifully. If one man, in the case of Schindler, or a small group of men, in the case of the ones in this film, can maintain their sanity, faith, and values in a world that has gone insane, then there is hope for mankind."
3524,"Movies like this are seldom and Hollywood tends to make it's films unnecessarily spectacular these days. The shared scenes between Enid and Seymour, though doomed to take a bad turn, are handled with tenderness by the director and actors and are quite memorable and touching. Thora Birch gives her most confident performance to date, and Scarlett Johansson is superbly laconic as Enid's icy side - kick. Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson are incredibly rich and vivid in their roles (low - keyed, deadpan, but not blanks); their love - hate friendship is convincing and blessedly free of melodramatics--even they seem to cherish the personality conflicts that come up, it may give them more ammunition. Where most movies set in high schools find resolve in romantics, "" Ghost World "" dares to be different."
5232,"Very rarely one can find such a well balanced movie with a full commitment from the whole staff: Director (Nalin Pan), all the Actors & the total Crew. The beauty of the locations is just breathless (at several thousands miles of altitude!) And if the hall has a good air conditioning system, for sure you will really feel the freezing winds that blows at the Himalayas by watching this outstanding film. There are some passages of the film that just tastes like a short documentary. Recognized as a Khenpo (a title of tibetan scholastic mastery), some further and higher Initiation will be bestowed on him by the Highest Rimpocheh nearby."
6049,"But the most interesting were the dialogs. So, if you like movies in which people investigate themselves, their lives, and their relationships, without giving you a definite answer what to do, you may enjoy this movie. They had been happily married for 12 years and have two sons as well. It was definitely really sweet to see those scenes. This would be a great film for those interested in the psychology behind modern relationships."
3304,"Shrek is a delightful comedy about a crude ogre, an energetic princess, a witty donkey and an uptight ruler. The comic highpoints in terms of voice characterization is Eddie Murphy as Shrek's donkey companion and John Lithgow as nasty Lord Farquaad, who wants to rid his domain of Duloc of all fairy tale creatures. Eddie Murphy being employed as a wisecracking donkey was a casting dream and plays well against the more plain Shrek, voiced by Mike Myers. Mike Myers is witty and brilliant as the voice of Shrek. John Lithgow plays the devious prince who sends Shrek on the quest to save the princesses."
4118,"A young boy tries to save the pokemon and it takes him somewhere. Kids are still playing the trading card game, they're still watching the TV series, they're waiting for the Game Boy Advance games, and they want to see "" Pokemon the 4th Movie . "" There they find a young boy named Sam who with the powerful PokÃ©mon Celebi has time - travelled forty years into his future. All Pokemon (Japanese for' The Monster who lives in the pocket') have special powers. But, apart from that a wonderful tale of Man and his Pokemon."
3587,"Writer / Director / Co-Star, Kevin Smith (Silent Bob) has without a doubt created if not his best movie, then it would have to be his funniest. This guy is for real, by far and away he has put in the best performance of all his five film appearances as "" Jay "" He carries the picture and is side splittingly funny. The only thing that lets the movie down is it's "" art school "" look; in places it can look like Smith happens to have some high powered friends that helped to promote this movie and make it the success it was. The 2 disc DVD is WELL worth getting if you like the movie, the outtakes are worth the money alone. Also the introductions to the many deleted scenes are worth watching, with Affleck again taking some lighthearted ripping from Mewes and Smith."
3208,"The casting of such big names must have cost a lot of money and more time and attention should have been taken with the script and you do get the irritating feeling that the producers thought having a couple of big names in the movie everything would have taken care of itself. Meanwhile, Samantha finds herself taken hostage by a gay hit man with a heart named Leroy (James Gandolfini of "" Get Shorty "" and TV's "" The Sopranos ""), who--by following all of the Hollywood cliches--is an amiable, likable guy who wouldn't harm a fly. Pitt and Roberts were a good match, and James Gandolfini really was the best part of this movie. The two hit men Leroy and the one played by Gandolfini were confusing enough. The studios advertised it as a sweet, funny comedy starring two of Hollywood's biggest stars."
4986,"Band of Brothers is a brilliant mini series about W. W. II. After Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan this is another realistic and good project from Spielberg and co. 10/10 Judging by other comments, it seems that this miniseries struck a chord with many viewers. Anyway, Band of Brothers is superbly done historically correct documentary about E Co, 101st Airborne. The miniseries takes the men through most of their combat engagements."
4122,"This movie is pure entertainment and has some very, very funny moments. Writer Stel Pavlou sent his unsolicited script to Tim Roth who in turn passed it onto Samuel L Jackson who liked it so much he raised the finance for THE 51ST STATE. That `s because logic and common sense are discarded to set up scenes later on in the movie. In fact in some places it `s like a live action cartoon, but the greatest problem is the cast going completely over the top. PLUNKETT AND MACLEANE - A period comedy thriller starring Robert Carlyle."
4995,"This is a true horror story beyond anything Stephen King could write, because this is ` real. This film is a veritable showcase for the incredible talent of Emma Thompson, who gives a performance that is so remarkable there are not enough superlatives to do it justice. As Vivian Bearing, Thompson is absolutely mesmerizing--you simply cannot take your eyes off of her for even a moment. Jonathan M. Woodward delivers a powerful performance as another hospital worker more interesting in numbers than people. Audra McDonald is well cast as the compassionate nurse (Susan) assigned as Bearing's primary care giver, who tries to ensure that, in the face of the doctors' temptation to continue to use Bearing as a guinea pig for their research, she will be treated with dignity and respect in her last days."
3838,"He has segmented his film into about eight chapters and then his motley group of enthusiastic interviews will be spiced throughout according to what they are talking about. The extreme fascination for turntables by these talented and quirky DJs is evident in their explanations of what their music means to them. As one who is generally unfamiliar with the hip - hop scene but has tried spinning, the movie does a great job of presenting turntablism as an art form. It also did a good job emphasizing that hip - hop is meant to be fun, and it is by no means about the rough - and - tumble gangsta rappers of years past. The "" story "" begins in the early 70's, and follows the evolution of turntablism as an art from up until early 2000 (turntablism aficionados will point this out as significant)."
4125,"In conclusion, the play / film contains dialogue and scenes that are memorable. No punches pulled in this one. Director Tim Blake Nelson has crafted a fascinating portrayal of the Sonderkomando, Jewish concentration - camp prisoners who help the Nazis in order to ensure for themselves a few extra months of life, as well as creature comforts denied to the other prisoners. The Sonderkommandos were Jewish prisoners who volunteered to work on the gas chambers and furnaces in exchange for better treatment and extended life."
3605,"A lot of the early scenes were funny and entertaining. So for people who love great 80s Rock, this movie will be a lot of fun. It started out with an interesting idea: small town guy worships famous band then gets the chance to perform for thousands as a member of the band he worships. Wahlberg did okay in his part, particularly in the concert scenes. Also, the emphasis on the "" rockin' "" parents and the scenes of the mom's home daycare center made the movie seem too cute and cuddly."
3812,"You can set them in the 18th century or a hundred years in the future and the characters are still real and powerful. He's plays parts like these so well, he's always walking that thin line between quirky and bored and you can't help but be enchanted by him. It's was just a beautiful sequence right before the dam breaks. Scotland PA is not a brilliant reworking of the MacBeth story, but it's fun, vibrant, and Tierney and Walken are worth and hour and forty minutes. There's a little Twin Peaks bound up in the recipe, as well."
3204,"After almost 90 minutes into the film, you will see why Sara is the way she is and maybe enjoy the movie. There's a good deal of loose ends in this story that were either not clearly explained or not explained at all. "" Sweet November "" is not a great movie, but it's sad, touching, sometimes funny and contains two fine performances. Keanu and amazing Charlize gave their best and created one of the best love stories ever. Charlize, as beautiful as always, made Sara strong and weak at the same time."
5071,"The movie isn't anything great, but it's got some cool stuff in it. Overall Tremors 3 looks like a B - grade movie from the cover but its a good entry in the series. This movie is as good as the 2nd movie but the first movie is still the best movie out of all 4 Tremor movies and its good that Michael Gross stars in this film playing Burt Gummer once again. And there are heaps of good scenes in this movie the best one is in the end of the movie when Burt Gummer and two other people are in a junk yard and they are trying to kill the new Monster that can fly and they have no guns so they make a potato gun and shoot out metal arrows from it. Tremors 3 is another fun dose of B - movie monster mayhem, albeit one slightly marred by the notable absence of the main stars of the first movie (Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward) and the inclusion of some rather ropey CGI effects."
3262,"Misinformation is the game, and Osnard is planning to get rich on it. He draws stunning performances out of his actors (apart from the ever annoying Jamie Lee Curtis). Imagine the complete antithesis of James Bond, a man who puts self before king and country, and loves them and leaves them with relish - enter Brosnan's Andy Osnard. Some may see some implausibility in the final conseuences of Osnard's and Pendel's actions, but on the whole the shamless good time they have bring these (almost) anti-heroes to life is infectious. Le Carre's books are well - done fabrications--good storytelling, or at least good enough to sell books."
3799,"A controversial, worthy, and very entertaining film that stretches your ability to make moral judgements within a convincingly coherent framework. Solondz again uses a lot of his trademark stark and unsettling characters to tell two separate stories. The Paul Giamatti character was a hilarious reflection of Solondz himself. Not just physically, but also in the way he was criticized for making fun of the characters in his documentary just as Solondz has been criticized for doing the same in "" Welcome to the Dollhouse "" and "" Happiness . "" No doubt wary after his previous ventures, Solondz attempts to circumvent some of the criticisms that less savvy viewers are bound to make."
4590,"This documentary is a very concise but excellent guide for the uninitiated into a world usually the arcane preserve of specialists most adept at talking to each other. While this documentary only covers the early period of Linux and Open Source history (up to about 2000), it provides great insights into how the software industry got itself where it is today. Several of those interviewed pursue their open source values almost as a creed, the commitment to computers taking the place of more traditional dogma. Anyone interested in a major intellectual counterpoint to the dominance of both Microsoft and the role of law in insuring proprietary benefits for innovators should see "" Revolution OS "": no manual required. Of course, since 2000, Linux has made great strides into the server market, the desktop market (even Walmart sells computers with Linux now), and the embedded market."
3203,"The film does have some funny moments, and Regina King is attractive as the love interest. The best that Mr. Keyes can come up with is ruthless, white, 60 - year old tycoon Charles Wellington. Heavenly honcho Mr. King (Chazz Palminteri of "" Analyze This ""), God's right - hand guy, apologizes and escorts Lance back to earth. There are a number of guinely funny moments in "" Down to Earth . """
3328,"For example, two couples are played by actors who are married to each other in real life (Kline and Cates, the Golds; and Hickey and Posey, the Adams). It embraced many universal points of conflict in relationships--be it with a spouse, a neighbor, a boss, a co-worker--and allowed you, as a viewer, to watch all of the varying (and often hilarious) perspectives. Close friends and associates have been invited to share whatever this is with them, as well as a couple of neighbors, Monica and Ryan Rose (Mina Badie, Denis O'Hare), who have certain ` issues' with Joe and Sally. Also turning in performances that stand out from the rest are Mina Badie (Leigh's real life half - sister) as the neighbor who comes to the party offering conciliatory overtures toward a more ` neighborly' relationship; John C. Reilly, as Mac Forsyth, a veteran director struggling with his latest project (the star of which just happens to be Sally Nash); and Peter Sellers look alike Michael Panes, as Sally's talented friend, Levi. This was a great film with numerous funny, dramatic, awkward, and stressful moments."
3202,"Amanda Peet was wickedly funny, and all three male stars were equally crass and deliciously low - down. She makes him abandon his friends of 20 years, she forces him to quite the band that he loves, she makes him take relationship counseling, she orders him around, she makes him wear a beeper so that she can have him at her beck and call, she tells his friends that Darren is her puppet and that she is the puppet master, she tells him what he can drink on the very first day that she meets him and she makes him burn all of his Neil Diamond records. Amanda Peet has a great resume of smaller films such as Body Shots, Playing By Heart, Whipped and She's The One. His two best friends are apparent losers that do nothing in life except party and listen to Neil Diamond songs."
3798,"It is amazing that people of such obvious ignorance should be allowed to make such crucial decisions: they should be held responsible for the garbage they feed to teenagers, and for keeping them away from meaningful films. Psychiatry is obviously useless in these cases; it works much better when you don't have any real problems. This gently satirical situation underlines the idleness of middleclass people enmeshed in their mostly self - created ` problems. He appears to be a happy man, happily married and a father of two well behaved teenagers."
5896,"Although at times having wit and comedy, one cannot help but feel that somewhere between the script and the subtitles the true entertainment was lost. In the end, the zany characters and moments of excitement do not cut it and leave something lacking. This movie is just one of the best movies ever made in Latin America and for sure in the world. The adventures of these guys are bound to entertain you even though, or more likely because they are adventures on a tragically small scale. The directors, Rebella and Stoll, made another film a few years later, Whisky, that it was more polished and mature, and dealt with the hopelessness not of the youth of Uruguay but of its middle aged people."
5145,"Anabeth was great as the "" best friend "". However, there is fun and enjoyment to be found in the story which is all about a group of young adults, their jobs, relationships, and pursuits of happiness with Whaley and Gish at the forefront as hapless romantics and "" blood brothers "" on a collision course with destiny. Sure, you will know how it ends the minute Annabeth Gish appears on screen, but the ride is so enjoyable and true to life, you won't care. The dialogue is true - to - life and witty enough that it keeps you interested, and there are a few unexpected twists with the B & C stories along the way as well. The cast is really talented, especially Gish, and the supporting players (in particular Cress Williams and Liz Vassey, who play another unlikely couple in the film), keep it moving."
3201,"Obviously, though SOTL focused mainly on Starling's character, Hannibal focuses on, well, Hannibal. These films are about twin worlds, the cop world of reason and the killer's world of urges, hidden self and powerful intuition. He was reduced from the center of a rich world in Manhunter to a human camera (). Hopkins was getting a bit old to play Hannibal, mid-60s by now, but to his credit he did handle himself remarkably well, and moved with the grace of a younger man."
3198,"The humor is unusual in that it has the same exaggeratedly campy tone as the teen horror aspects. Valentine is the second industrial movie of the director Jamie Blanks, after his Urban Legends. A group of model - caliber San Francisco women who have been friends since elementary school are suddenly being threatened and attacked by someone sending them bizarre Valentine's Day cards. It's an incongruity that is cleverly woven throughout the film, and that is itself at the heart of the slasher genre, making it prime fodder for Valentine's extravagant lampooning. Valentine's Day has a lush look throughout, with complex, deep colors, interesting sets, and good staging."
3207,"Costner is always on the leafy edge, whether he's dancing with wolves, building baseball fields for ghosts or water - skiing as bait for sea monsters. Although it breaks little new ground in its already overworked genre, the film does emerge as an efficient crime drama thanks to a gallery of interesting characters, some impressive performances and Demian Lichtenstein's flashy directorial style."
3196,"The plot isn't terribly important, but it involves an FBI agent (Prinze) trying to solve a diamond smuggling crime ring while falling for a pretty art restorer (Potter). Film fans who enjoy "" Dumb and Dumber "", "" Happy Gilmore "", and "" High Heels and Low Lifes "" would probably also enjoy "" Head Over Heels . "" Freddie Prinze Jr. & Monica Potter play "" normal "" people falling in love, amidst NYC's fashion scene. The models: Shalom, Sara, Ivana, & Tomiko play it way over the top and it works. There are some genuinely funny parts and the "" stereotypical "" models provided the most laughs."
3206,"Henry Selick's first feature, "" The Nightmare Before Christmas "", was a modern classic. Then there's Downtown, which you must admit, looks good. It seems to be geared to get a reaction - every pore in the first forty minutes is explored for it surreal quality - creatures of another world abound. Mr. Fraser does an amazing job playing not only one but two roles of extreme eyeball pleasure. If you love movies that involve not only animated characters with purple gas but Chris Kattan then you will absolutely adore this hilarious romp through reality and B. F. eality."
3152,"The performances are all good especially by Brewster and Diaz. She is simply gorgeous and her careful mannerisms make her very believable as a hippie. This could have been a good movie, with some intense parts and good play. If the movie was honest from the beginning, then it could have become a very humanly intense road movie, like the kind of '70s movies by Bogdanovich or Altman. The acting and sceneries are good though."
3151,"Just watching the previews, you pretty much have a good idea what's going to happen in the end. O_O Honestly, stop judging the movie like you're some kind of almighty critic, and watch it for what it is. While the plot complications are limited to the unavailability of either of the two main characters (where Steve is unable to abandon his prior commitments and Mary is ready to take up new ones), The Wedding Planner is most enjoyable when it creates romantic settings for its lovesick characters. The directing is great, the dialog is entertaining, the acting is enjoyable, the movie over-all is fantastic. This film is quirky; all the actors and actresses don't miss a beat and they keep it real."
3150,"The point: cheese is good, though overindulgence could cause health problems. As an American journalist wrote about Stephen J. Cannell, the only real similarity between "" Baa Baa Black Sheep "" and "" The Greatest American Hero "" is that both shows involve flying. Now, Sugar And Spice, is about a group of high school cheerleaders, who are all the best of friends, and they would do anything for each - other. Buried on both sides of the Atlantic by "" Bring It On "" (the latter didn't duplicate its American box office success in the UK, but at least it got to cinemas), it's to the credit of "" Sugar & Spice "" that there's a big difference between the two in terms of plot, characters and overall feel - okay, they are both about cheerleaders but are they really cut from the same cloth on that count? The movie's intentionally uncomfortable to watch, but also never especially funny - and it doesn't help that with the exception of Alexandra Holden as Fern, most of the cast aren't too believable as teenagers (and why do so many of them have first or last names that begin with the letter M?"
3268,"But the slapstick is funny, has great co-stars like Joe Don Baker and Chris Walken. It's a lot of laughs and fun for plebes at heart. While it is no masterpiece by any stretch, and uses jokes focused on every kind of possible emission of bodily gases, fluids, and solids, there is something about David Spade's earnest if simple portrayal of "" Joe Dirt "" that adds up to a rather fun and enjoyable film. If you like movies such as Dodgeball, Old School, Tommy Boy, Black Sheep, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, etc. you will love this one. Of course, few if any modern - day comedies are "" family fare "" and this one isn't either but the lead character is a gentle, harmless guy."
3267,"Although Helen Fielding also wrote the screenplay (w / Richard Curtis, very skilled with romantic comedies) and keeps the laughs coming, this movie could have fallen flat on its face. (You have a heart of stone if you aren't moved to laughs or tears or pity for her.) Although set in England, the theme and feelings of single people everywhere were universal. Characters: Mark Darcy, the love of Bridget's life, and Daniel Cleaver, quite funnily enough, also, the love of Bridget's life are sworn enemies. The movie, like the book, has the most hilarious lines and moments, and each of the actors portrayed their characters so well you couldn't imagine anyone else in that part."
3144,"Gone is the trademark uber - performance. Robin Wright Penn (okay, maybe she wasn't so difficult), Helen Mirren, Vanessa Redgrave and Mickey Rourke all give fine vignettes. But perhaps the most amazing performance was Benicio Del Toro as Toby Wadenah, the accused Native American. His performance was breathtaking and worth watching the entire movie, just for the 5 minutes he was in it. Penn is also, like Eastwood, brave enough to tie up the ends loosely at best."
3142,"However a white girl seeing a clever black man is never going to be popular and the couple must overcome many obstacles to see their dreams and be true to themselves. The film was sweet, touching and violent, and worked in all aspects. Derek and Sara fall in love and it is hard for them because they get a lot of problems just because they are in interracial couple. The match with Derek is natural, since they share these traits. if you're a white girl from the midwest you better not date black men from the projects or you'll get treated with unkind gestures (ouch!)"
3265,"This movie has been underrated by many people because it's about drugs, but the story is just a story, but the message it brings and the emotions it triggers, are lasting. A thumpingly good soundtrack right from the start and Johnny Depp cruising in to be a convincingly laid - back big - shot - almost like a graduate from Boogie Nights. At any rate, back to the film, which is wonderfully shot backed up by great performances from Johnny Depp, Ray Liotta and Jordi Molla. The film moves seamlessly from George's adolescence to adulthood through a number of locations and vividly captures the essence of that decadent era. The sets, costumes and music all work perfectly."
3141,"Jones' performance in Replacements is proof positive of his talent. So he switches places with Freddie and has to get to Mexico to meet an FBI agent who'll protect him. It also has some pretty decent action sequences and some quirky moments. There are flaws, there are clichÃ©s and there is an extremely happy ending. Although nowhere near as good a comedy as Blazing Saddles, it is comparable in certain aspects."
3140,"This corporation has been known to spend extraordinary resources on PR (including, for example, bribing journalists and college professors), so almost certainly some of the comments on this message board will be produced by that corporation and should be read in that light. His uncanny Bill Gates like character will leave true computer geeks rolling in the aisles. Second, while murder is a bit over the top, pretty well all the other crimes committed by the large corporation in this movie are things of which the real corporation has been seriously accused, been found to be planning, or in some cases, convicted; yet in every case managing to escape with fines or compensation payments much smaller than the profits they made from the crime. Tim Robbins and Ryan Philippe both give good performances, and nobody seems out of place talking about technology. Beside the technical details presented, good movie, good action, good plot twists."
3303,"All these qualities have allowed him to strike the perfect note of a very male spirituality in a number of films, from "" Frequency "" to "" Thin Red Line "" to "" Pay It Forward "" to "" The Passion "" to "" Angel Eyes . "" This was a truly touching film, and an excellent performance by both Caviezel and Lopez. Yet despite those faults the film sails through as fine entertainment because of fine believable performances from Caviezel, Lopez, Sonia Braga, and Shirley Knight. "" Angel Eyes "" was marketed as a supernatural thriller that offered spooky, scary insights into fate, love, danger, and perhaps life after death. Take a deeper look and you will see that James Caviezel is the true Angel Eyes."
3521,"Thankfully Part III is much, much better. It won't linger too long in the memory but as far as Summer Popcorn Movies go, this is great stuff. The cast, led by the ever dependable Sam Neill, spend most of their time running and jumping and looking pensive--their acting muscles aren't exactly taxed--but it's fun to watch these great actors (especially William H. Macy) on a big rollercoaster ride, getting the hell knocked out of them. Joe Johnston takes over the megaphone duties for this sequel and he does a damn fine job. Jurassic Park III is perhaps the best example of why excellent actors (Sam Neill and William H. Macy have both turned in stellar work in other movies) cannot revive a dead script no matter how much they try, and they do."
8653,"His scenes with young Mr. Newton are really special. Compared to the usual "" grind 'em out "" television long - form projects, there is a lot of texture and attention to detail: cast performances, production design, cinematography, and even if the casting and direction of the background players. a thoughtfully written, performed, and photographed Movie of the Week, which took full advantage of rustic rural and suburban locations in and near Charlotte, NC. A wonderful drama with great performances and serious subject matter. Eventually she helps, dad helps, gets fired for it, bricks are delivered on time, son, mom, and dad begin a new understanding of what is important, and perhaps a family reconciliation."
3619,"No belly - laughs here, but a lot of knowing smiles. What's more, the outside circle, the peripheral friends / instigators / colleagues, etc., add immeasurably to the humor and atmosphere of the piece, particularly Aida Turturro as a worldly wise teacher / friend of Dawson's, Dennis Farina as Burns' overt male chauvinist boss, Michael Leydon Campbell in dual roles as a rocker and male half of a bickering married couple, and Callie Thorne as the bickering wife. Burns, Dawson, Tucci, Murphy, Klumholtz, and Graham all have meaty roles here and each of their stories are well - presented and attention - grabbing."
3264,"ALONG CAME A SPIDER / (2001) ** (out of four) By Blake French: In 1997, a big year for serial killer movies, Gary Fleder's "" Kiss the Girls "" enriched the genre with a sense of splendid atmosphere, mystery and intrigue. This may not be a blockbuster, but this solid and underrated thriller delivers what so few of them have to offer these days: a final plot twist that genuinely surprises. These endings not only come as genuine surprises and are completely satisfying; they force you to reconsider everything that went before in the film. Along came a Spider does turn out to be a decent thriller, with plenty of action, suspense and ample plot twists, but on the down side it still isn't as good as' Kiss the Girls' Morgan Freeman puts in a typically solid performance and the support cast are all good enough, however the storyline does become a little disjointed at times, and it contains some minor plot holes that distract from the overall effect of the movie. Had The Sixth Sense ended five minutes before it did you still would have remembered the performances, the genuinely scary moments and the fantastic plot."
3618,"About the Movie: Ethan Hawke plays Jake Hoyt, a rookie police officer with a good curriculum that is assigned to a one day trial day in order to qualify for a narcotics division in Los Angeles. Hoyt wants fiercely to get this assignment, but finds very orthodoxes and quaint ways to "" protet and to serve "" of Alonzo. In this day Hoyt will meet a true challenge and will face the total opposite way to proceed from the one he learned in the academy; he will also face some of the more dangerous neighborhoods and streets of Los Angeles. Training Day is a solid action crime thriller with exceptional performances by Ethan Hawke and especially Denzel Washington. Ethan Hawke is equally impressive as rookie cop Jake Hoyt who finds himself in one increasingly dangerous situation after another."
7840,"It leaves the impression of a documentary about Jazz made by purists for purists, completely disregarding a huge chunk of very important Jazz, and mockingly downplaying it to boot. Once jazz had been firmly defined as an improvised music emphasizing certain kinds of instruments and instrumental combinations, there developed a tendency among jazz musicians to draw almost exclusively from earlier jazz styles, often the "" purer "" styles of recent vintage. Herbie Hancock, who is a pillar of Jazz and probably the most important Jazz - man of the last 30 years, was barely mentioned as a part of Miles Davis' group. Louis Jordan is singled out in "" Jazz "" as someone who led black audiences awa y from jazz, yet his music developed directly from the swing music of the 30's and early 40's."
4228,"He's also breathtakingly prolific, having completed around twenty projects since this, which was released only three years ago (!) Those three movies alone prove he is the most exciting and innovative director working today, but' Visitor Q' takes him to a whole new level. Takashi's version exaggerates the degree and manner in which this family is broken, but his stylistic exaggerations are uncomfortably acceptable."
3680,"While its only setting is inside a motel room, the written word by Stephen Belber transforms this into a thrilling drama about past lives and future consequences. As the events unfold with clever twists, it becomes an intense human drama and a thrilling experience for the audience. It has some great performances, good direction, brilliant writing and will very likely keep you glued to the screen."
3655,"Well, Blanchett perfectly completes the trio of actors, and has a great chemistry with the 2 male leads. It was fun watching the strong and macho Willis vie lanky pushover Thornton over the love of alluring Blanchett. It creates an interesting conflict, and spawns some very funny scenes. Not the best of Barry Levinson's movies but certainly not the worse either. Joe Blake (Bruce Willis) and Terry Collins (Billy Bob Thornton) are inmates who partner up in an escape from prison by stealing a cement truck."
3302,"It is an uncompromising real life look, and it is up to the viewer to decipher; sometimes this works sometimes not. According to the DVD the producers cut some realistic (and boringly technical) scenes to focus more on the relationship between Tom and Kaleil. The most compelling part is the coorelation between their relationship eroding as does the company. It is here that first possible chinks in the armor of the two friends emerge: Tom starts mentioning ideas in meetings that Kaleil doesn't want to pitch to the investors, and quickly becomes frustrated with his inability to stay on message. The filmmaker's insistence on no narration or title cards is a stylistic choice which, in this instance, proves fatal as the scenes presented by themselves offer no clear narrative through - line."
3846,"Much of the cinema in the past has treated Cannibalism either in a sci fi vein (much like George Romero's "" dead "" movies) or for use as shock value. While this is happening, like some wild animal, Dalle starts playing with the terminally injured man, nipping, playing with pieces of flesh, and kissing him. The movie does contain some quite disturbing scenes, but they serve to heighten the emotional drama that the film's really about rather than being an end in themselves. The two much talked about cannibalism scenes occur pretty late in the film and are worthy of the fuss - they are stunning. It certainly has moments that fit those adjectives, but then there are scenes of great power that really impress."
3642,"The three principles--Walker, Zahn and Sobieski--give good performances, and the villain is masterfully done by Matthew Kimbrough (who provided the body), Ted Levine (who provided the bizarre, creepy voice), and Dahl, who wisely shows glimpses of him, but only glimpses. Leelee Sobieski plays the intuitive girl - next - door friend who ends up along for the ride, and she also gives a worthy performance. An intense action / horror / thriller directed by John Dahl that stars Steve Zahn (Stuart Little 2, Sahara), Paul Walker (2 Fast 2 Furious, Into the Blue), and Leelee Sobieski (The Glass House, Eyes Wide Shut). But once Lewis and Fuller pick up Lewis' girlfriend (Leelee Sobieski), things start right up again with increased intensity, and the realization that this isn't just any trucker. It is loaded with tension and it's easy for viewers to picture themselves in the scenario, as it's relatively realistic."
3299,"Plenty of laughs from a zany character or two and a grand adventure with plenty of old world jousting, pageantry, and costumes. After you get past the first one or two scenes, everything really grows on you. Once you get past the glaring anachronisms (put in the film on purpose, of course), you find the movie is actually quite true to its period. Chaucer was great, the villain was definitely evil, and the jousting / action scenes were very well done. Keep watching after the credits for a funny clip;)."
4249,"Whole idea of the movie is to find the real connection between love and luck, to investigate whether they are two sides of the same story. There are also very intense and interesting scenes like the run in the forest, that will take out your breath. In doing so, he gets away from the formulas of the other Spanish filmmakers working in the Spanish cinema of today. He belongs to a new bred of creators with a sharp eye for detail and cinematic style. Max Von Sydow brings his royal presence as Samuel, the master player of the game that pits him against all the others that dare come close to him."
3604,"The movie had incredible stunts and great fights. There are certainly some good fights going on in this picture. The fight scenes are very well done, and the pacing keeps the viewer interested. He then grows up and trains himself to be the best fighter, to become a hero and stop what happened to his parents from happening again. There are some nice performances from most of the character actors, the original 3 musketeers are great, and the humor if not the plot is very in keeping with the book."
3640,"Zoolander has a great soundtrack a very humorous plot and is light enough to enjoy whatever the mood. Jerry Stiller, like Wilson, always manages to find humor in every role he plays, and in Zoolander this remains especially true. Directed by and starring Ben Stiller, Zoolander is a very funny movie, if you know what to expect. To enjoy Zoolander, one has to forget all expectations and see the movie for what it is supposed to be: ridiculous. But it's incredibly funny, especially the DVD."
3280,"Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, and Arnold Vosloo were very well chosen for their roles. Get the DVD when it comes out, it will at least tide you over until George Lucas gets his head out of his proverbial and realises that the VHS era is well and truly over. The situations and set - pieces are wilder, the odds even bigger and character arcs more complex. Set 10 years after the first movie Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz have made a rich living out of plundering tombs and pyramids. Arnold Vosloo gets to do more with his character, and Patricia Velasquez (who has about 10 times as much screen time as she did in the first film) has a lot of fun acting like Jennifer Lopez's alter - ego."
3638,"So it's tempting to ask, merely as a theoretical exercise, "" can you make a movie that is essentially a model kit assembled from other movies, and still make it effective? "" The whole movie pretty well follows typical Hollywood thriller formulas, but it is pretty entertaining anyway, especially since the story is told in a way that you don't really know what is going on until the very end. Famke Janssen is good as his wife. The little girl playing Douglas' daughter does well, too, cute but not cloying, smart but credible; there is an amusing scene where she attempts to make conversation with the hulking, tattooed murderer who is guarding her, eventually cajoling him into making peanut - butter and jelly sandwiches. Jennifer Esposito is also very believable as a cop, Sean Bean as a kidnapper and, as mentioned, Famke as a trophy wife."
3875,"While "" KJS "" could be viewed as many things, it is most accurately one of those "" free spirit helps straight - laced person break out of his / her shell "" movie. For her bad luck, her brother is getting engaged and her mother is making pressure on her to have a serious relationship with someone. What makes it wonderful is that all the characters have whole lives which they live in confusion and compassion, pathos and passion. Jessica Stein is a beautiful Jewish journalist who always have problems with love. The relationships explored are real and three - dimensional and every element that moves the story forward is done with subtlety and humour."
3876,"This is an amazing film by Lieven Debrauwer. Both of the protagonists' roles, played by Dora van der Groen and the now deceased Ann Petersen, are impressive. The colors of the sets are interesting in conjunction with the character development. In a remarkably short space of time, some 75 minutes in the DVD version, director Lieven Debrauwer sets the scene, a small town in Belgium, and the back story of four sixty - something sisters, Martha (Julienne De Bruyn) who has taken it upon herself to provide both a home and tlc for Pauline (Dora van der Groen) who is described as a 66 year old child given that she is retarded; a third sister Cecile (Rosemarie Bergmans) has long since quit the small town for Brussells where she lives with her latest boyfriend whilst the fourth, Paulette (Ann Petersen) runs a ladie's haberdashery in the town. Pauline (convincingly portrayed by Dora van der Groen) has a preference for flowers (both real and photographed) and bright colors."
3877,"To say that this film is a must see is an understatement; it should be mandatory for all Palestinians and Jews to see it together. It's just too bad that so many millions will be in line to see "" Star Wars "" next week, and maybe less than 1% of those people will see this film. 7 children, 7 hates, 7 different lives, 7 possibilities, 1 meeting and 1 million chances to peace. "" Promises "" is a shiny and wonderful documentary about the conflicts between Israel and Palestine showed by children. It's extraordinary to see them talking about the conflicts: they repeat their parents' opinion until the director B. Z. suggests a meeting."
4270,"While this engaging film wonderfully depicts the evolution of a young man into the ferocious killing machine emperor called ChandAshoka (Wild Ashoka) it pays little attention to the much more vital legacy as DharmAshoka (Faithful Ashoka). Cutting two songs, and adding another 10 minutes of exposition to show his evolution into the enlightened and compassionate meesenger of Buddhism would have made the film much more complete, and raised it to the level of highest achievement. Ashoka made Kalinga into a centre of Buddhism that endured more than a millennium, until the Shaivaite and Vaishnavite Hindu Renaissance of the 12th and 13th centuries. His grandfather Chandragupta, who is seen as convert to the ultra-pacifist Jain faith in the opening scenes, married the daughter of rht edfeated Greek general Seleucus Nicator, who led Alexander the Great's forces to defeat in the Punjab. Ashoka was born of one of Bindusara's Indian wives, which makes Ashoka at least one quarter Greek--he was the very fusion of the Greco - Indian classical tradition, snd it was he who caused to be erected the collossal Buddhas at Bamiyan, destroyed earlier this year by the Taliban government in Afghanistan."
3644,"A few years on, Jonathan and Sara are both engaged to other people, but each keeps thinking about whether the other is their true soulmate, and then they start to see signs which they interpret as the fates trying to tell them something And the fact that Cusack makes Jonathan so believable, and someone with whom you can identify, has more than a lot to do with it. It's a quality performance from an actor with the flexibility and range to do just about anything, and who never disappoints. Cusack is so likable, and manages to convey the bedevilment of his situation with such facility, that the viewer is unequivocally drawn in from the beginning. The fate angle is plowed mercilessly, almost to the point of nausea, but the skits are funny and the chemistry between Cusack and Beckinsale is enchanting."
3327,"Berry strips and Jones grimaces like their lives depended on it. And the set - pieces are also very impressive, if slightly over the top. There are so many films in the action genre that result to dumbing down the smart villains, just so the hero of the story will look good when he comes up with a relatively weak solution to the complex plot. This movie can be summed up as: lots of very cool action scenes (fans of both bullet time and explosions will really enjoy this), a lot of style, and a standard implausible plot."
3825,"Super Troopers combines solid physical comedy with surprisingly solid comedy writing. The actors who play the five troopers are all really talented unknowns (especially the guy who plays Farva), and they should all get more starring roles. These guys really know how to make you laugh your ass off, and the fact that they manage to keep the straightest faces imaginable while doing it is priceless. Good plot tension is added by there rivalry with the local cops and there fight over the territory. There are great performances from all of the characters including the stoners, cops, and troopers."
3279,"What went on behind the scenes was funny & screwball in itself, and most of all, it was not even scripted at all. ' The difference is that although the studio has sliced and diced this, there are still some funny bits. Very funny bits, like the polar bear / Monroe oral sex scene. Beatty's timing is great: he has the ability to coordinate his movements with his comic reactions. But there are some signs here of a potentially successful project."
4569,"Stephen Chow writes, directs and stars in probably his funniest and most accessible (to Western audiences, at least) film to date. You've got a variety of misfits--the spunky young 'n with the steel leg, the obese convenience store clerk who can nearly fly, the plutocratic salary man who uses a style reminiscent of Flying Chimpanzee's Cotton Belly in Wing Chun. Many moments are extremely funny, with the over-the-top storyline made famous by HK, and also the very touching moments with the acne - ridden baker girl / love interest as she is only accepted for what she is. It made sound like a clichÃ©, but you truly have to see this movie to believe it. He also finds time to fall in love with Tai - Chi baker Mui (the usually lovely Vicki Zhao), who gets some of the funniest scenes in the movie."
3396,"While the beginning and end stick pretty closely to the conventions of the genre, the events in between manage to take some very interesting turns. While some of those films are enjoyable in their way, this patronizing approach is all too common in the movies, where the formula is always about whether some "" exotic "" culture is willing to adapt to Western norms that are inevitably deemed superior. Adebimpe plays the character to such perfection that some of the movie's laughs come simply from the nuances of his voice and gestures. Without ever quite descending into surrealism, these scenes play like a tribute to several comic filmmakers from Blake Edwards to Woody Allen. As in most romantic comedies, the rival love interest is a douche bag."
3397,"Jon Favreau directs and stars as Bobby. Bobby's a hothead who's doing it to help his girlfriend quit her stripping job, Ricky's a major screwup who doesn't know when to shut his mouth. Jon Favreau's' proper' follow - up to 96's' Swingers' see's him as part of a double - act with Vince Vaughn. Oh yeah, there is some real talent and dark humor in Jon Favreau's writing and directing. Then again, having Favreau / Vaughn together again will always conjure up thoughts of T & Mikey."
3657,"The general plot: Diane moves to L. A. after jitterbug contest to get into acting. She then took the real Camilla and turned her into a perfect, submissive out - of - the - movies girlfriend and used Rita Hayworth as an inspiration. ' Mulholland Drive' is by far the most successful expression of David Lynch's cinematographic style and vision since the first season of his' Twin Peaks' TV series. As Lynch enthusiasts know, his is a style and vision uniquely blended from film noir, horror movies, surrealism, and parapsychology â€“ with a healthy dose of postmodern self - consciousness and black humor thrown in for good measure. While bits and pieces of imagery and dialog suggest that much, if not all, of the earlier material is projected and displaced from the fevered subconscious of Diane herself, other bits and pieces suggest the perhaps supernatural intervention of a cast of characters drawing direct inspiration from' Twin Peaks,' including Michael J. Anderson reprising his unearthly dwarfish powers and a Bob - variant who hangs out behind Winkies and is the ultimate repository for the blue box and its id - like associations."
3904,"In the novel as in the film, there are two big antagonists to the "" heroine "" Kohut: her own mother (wonderful, wreck - voiced Annie Girardot, in a part originally intended for Jeanne Moreau) and Austria itself. "" La Pianiste "" also deals with a very powerful and delicate issue: how dangerous it is to reveal your innermost fantasies to the one (you think) you love. Michael Haneke (as a film - maker) and brilliant Isabelle Huppert (as the music professor Erika Kohut) place sexual relationships within a larger frame of reference--that of the boundaries of one's own SELF. Bravo, Michael Haneke and Isabelle Huppert for a brilliant movie and an equally brilliant and tense performance! In the much - discussed toilet scene, Haneke's camera brings you so close to the action that all you can do is squirm."
3658,"The 17 - year - old punker helps him awaken to life's interesting couplings like cavorting mannequins, and he shows her love unalloyed. Jill Franklyn, who wrote the "" Yada Yada "" episode of "" Seinfeld, "" pens perfect lines for the understated Brooks, such as when he first sees Sobieski: "" Scram. Leelee Sobieski has another great performance in the role of a disturbed and rebellious teenager, needy of love and care, who changes her behavior when she meets her soul - mate friend in a middle - age man. This quirky film is a must see for all who need a refreshing look at relationships and personal growth. Being accepted as you are and for who you are is the basis for all honest and lasting relationships."
3659,"One of the favorites at the Sedona Film festival. Outstanding performances, well written, everything comes together in a powerful yet disturbingly emotional manner. Arquette gives a brilliant performance as does Cheedle and Stoltz. Gabrielle Mann comes off a little too' waah, waah, Mr. Sensitive author' but there's an honesty that rings true in his performance and works nicely with the others. The story is deceptively simple - a rock and roll chick who is pretty messed up for reasons that become clear when she hooks up with a young journalist - but it's the feelings that pierce and soar in this film."
3667,"The critics, nit - pickers and historical pedants who've trashed this superb piece of truly cinematic movie - making have totally missed the point. OK, so Heather Graham was impossibly glamorous, but movies with big budgets need a little bit of star appeal. The quirky, literate script; the performances (all, with the possible exception of Graham, excellent); the wonderful photography and production design; the depiction of the murders themselves - elliptical, shocking, mesmerising; and above all the aura of brooding menace, gloom, cruelty, darkness, melancholy and downright despair running through it as deeply as the veins through a block of marble. No happy Hollywood ending, no phoney saccharine or cheap laughs to satisfy the popcorn brigade. Based on an ambitious graphic novel written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Eddie Campbell, From Hell (named for the signature on the Jack the Ripper letters written to the police), is one man's carefully researched theory into the eternal mystery surrounding the Whitechapel murders of 1888."
3668,"The Last Castle is about honor to one's self and honor among soldiers, even if they are prisoners. With his blond ambition and undeniable desirability to prison men of all persuasions, Redford turns this punishment into yet another spectacle with which to win over the hearts of his fellow crims. Redford coaxes The Patriot from this ragtag band of uncertain heroes, twisting Tony's panties into cat's cradles in the process. The whole place is ruled by Col. Winter (James Gandolfini), a tinpot tyrant who delights in turning his prisoners against one another. Even the jolliest, funniest, most easy going prisoners in Shawshank had an underlying sense of danger about them."
4300,"The interplay between Noemi and Mme. Vidal, also played earnestly by Catherine Frot, is one of the best combinations of wits in a film. Actors Vincent Lindon and Catherine Frot are wonderful, as usual, but it's newcomer Rachida Brakni who is stunning from first to last. The viewers will laugh at the right time, enjoy the humour but importantly at the same time, they will not miss the underlying irony of things. The same thing can be said of movies with a social agenda: it's better if you don't see it coming, which makes it all the more effective when it's over. And Malika / Noemie (Rachida Brakni), a beautiful, extremely intelligent prostitute of Algerian descent."
3617,"35: 1 frame are a dime a dozen. As she crosses the paths of more people, eventually said people twig to the fact that she can vocalise with the best of them. This kind of story has been done before, with such real - life examples as the Jacksons providing source material for one excellent miniseries of the theme."
5903,"The production values are very high, great acting, direction, cinematography, script, music, everything is top notch. while it is violent, confrontational, and decidedly dark, it bristles with underlying emotion and shows life without the rose coloured glasses. Seo Won (female lead), has given an excellent performance, and really shows the viewers what it's like being a Korean prostitute. On the whole, another brilliant Korean flick, of which there are many coming into mainstream cinemas in the UK now."
3669,"And perhaps in seeing these roles acted out, you will see someone you know who has touched your life. Their marriage enforced by her pregnancy and consequently due to unwritten rules of puritanism governing a small Connecticut community, brought together two rather unexperienced and immature teens. Based on the life of Beverly Donoforio, and the book with the same title, this movie was phenomenal. This will undoubtedly be Drew Barrymoe's greatest performances. This movie had a great cast including Steve Zahn - who was outstanding as Ray - Beverly's drug taking husband, Adam Garcia, Maggie Gyllenhaal, James Woods, and Peter Facinelli - who all gave unforgettable heart warming performances."
3905,"The characters are colorful, and how it starts w / one character's 30th, and ends a year later on her 31st, was very well - done, as it wrapped IT ALL UP VERY NICELY! This movie is absolutely hilarious and provides a in - dept view of the emotional and personal crisis that everyone experiences as they grow older. All this while laughing heartily at Tracy Morgan and Allen Payne, Debbie DeSouza, Erika Alexander, Kadeem Hardison, etc. . Excellent movie and aside from one mature sexual scene involving Tracy Morgan (which was actually more comedic in nature) it is free of the usual over-the-top sexual content and lustful behaviors that generally describe young adults."
3260,"Instead it is silly, goofy and really very daft but still quite good fun for slightly older children and also for adults. Daryl Sabara was so cute playing Juni and should go far as well. This was a silly kids' adventure story but still fun the younger ones and for adults, thanks to colorful scenes, great special effects, decent humor and a nice family tone to it. She prepares her offspring for bed and turns the lights off, walks to her husband, and explains she thinks it would be a good idea to tell Carmen and Juni their real identities as top - secret spies; the story Ingrid enlightened her kids with was true. Surprisingly fun to watch, even for adults and worth a look."
4633,"The first half sets the scene beautifully, explaining what Lagaan is, introducing the characters and gradually pulling the audience into this period and place, literally taking the viewer into Champaner through cinematography which highlights the locales and sets which establish the standard of living. Indian actor Aamir Khan's home production is a cinematic experience which highlights Indian cinema to the hilt, while weaving a tale set in Champaner during the time of the British Empire's presence which deals with Lagaan (the tax of the land) and a village's upheaval against its oppressors. The slow building of trust and community among the usually - bickering villagers as they prepare for their ultimate battle is both fascinating and inspiring. The best part of the movie is the characterization of the eleven players (villagers). It makes you feel for the characters, believe in the villagers and draws you into the celluloid created world, while the second presents to you their turmoil, dawns on you what is at stake and whisks you away in a tornado of emotions and rising spirits."
3670,"This movie can be enjoyed on many levels, and also a whole spectrum of interpretations can be drawn from it, watch it and see what it makes you feel. The monologues are thought provoking and compelling. Taking the general form of Slackers, he adds a metaphysical story line and coats it with extraordinary eye candy. The string quartet tango score also is an excellent use of music to reinforce the exotic aspects of the production."
3671,"Everyone from the science fiction fans (Who appreciated the depth and seriousness of the subject matter) to the warm n' fuzzy brigade (Who "" Get the message "" of the movie) have done their part to praise the various facets of a film that refuses to be categorized and is simply a very, very good story. And Iain Softley obviously had an enormous respect for the material because when it came time to tell the stories and let it speak through the actors, he pulled back, kept it simple and left the audience to witness to incredible performances by Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey to leave viewers with the same feeling; the acting is beautiful and inspiring. It's a gentle, engaging, quiet film that punches viewers between the eyes not through editing, action or shouting, but through that most basic and often forgotten art of cinema, finding a strong story and just letting it tell itself. Bridges makes an excellent doctor (you * want * to tell him what's on your mind) and Spacey's expressions and gestures are perfect in the role. This is a rare example of the director staying in the shadows and inducing outstanding acting performances out of talented actors to let the story dominate."
3672,"On The Line is a sweet and innocent movie for little girls or those who love cute little romances. It's definately unique to other movies that are out right now because it's a "" feel good movie "". The end's a little cheesy, but for someone who also played open mic's at one point, it's nice to indulge a fantasy now and then. It seems like the role of Rod, Kevins best friend was made for Joey Fatone. Emmanuelle Chriqui is a great actress and compliments Bass beautifully as they have good chemistry together."
3673,"Five or ten more minutes of scary interaction between the ghosts and the children (if you can call Shannon Elizabeth a child) would have made the movie much better. Human monsters, even if having to go through 4 + hours of make - up sessions, even if having to use a double amputee actor to play a particular ghost, are the film's best trump card. So this film can be a real party pooper if you're watching it with the lights off at your girlfriend's house waiting for her to grab your arm through the hard scenes, or expect to enjoy having some nightmares about it. The film hits you with a punch to the senses in the opening scenes before settling down to a poor man struggling to make ends meet after the tragic death of his wife. Jump cuts and abrupt scene changes only carry so far."
3674,"Jake Gyllenhaal (The Day After Tomorrow, October Sky) plays a brilliant troubled teenager. "" In the end, _ Donnie Darko _ is a film about people who feel life and all the emotions within it very deeply. Regardless of anything, sincere thought and expression went in to the making of Donnie Darko. The visuals were supported by a truly emotional score and its hard to find fault in the 80's pop tunes that found their way into some of the more impressive scenes. Jake Gyllenhaal, a relative unknown, delivers a subtle yet emotionally charged performance as Donnie himself - the scene in which he tells his psychologist of his various childhood traumas is made both funny and moving by the haunting way in which Jake delivers each line, contrasted with the almost childish qualities of his movements on the couch."
3913,"Filled with great comic sketches, as well as heart - touching moments, this film is definitely worth Â£ 3. Some good acting (espcially by Timothy Spall) leads this film well on it's way to the thumbs up. It was probably made to capitalize on the well - deserved success of the "" Full Monty "": both films have a lot in common; proles / prisoners setting a show up. The major drawback is Christopher Plummer's part: it's really underwritten and the scenarists obviously favored James Nesbitt's role. The rest of the inmates were pretty good, with Bill Nighy's scene - stealing poncey Roger as the standout."
6922,"Hearing Allen's first impressions of 2001 is refreshing (he didn't like it at first), whilst Scorsese's reaction to Paths of Glory is a perfect tribute to that picture's power ("" It was so honest, it was shocking! "") Okay, maybe his death has something to do with it, but after dozens of occasions during which both Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall berated him for how he treated them on the set of The Shining, hearing them say it was generally a positive experience is surprising to say the least. But remembering him through his work and the people who appeared in his movies is the most appropriate way to make a chronicle of his eventful life. This negation will soon be compensated with positive contemporary interviews from his family, directors and actors. This impressive documentary covers most of Stanley Kubrick's work, through the recollections of major figures in the film industry that, somehow, came into contact with this legendary director."
3919,"This is a very dark and intriguing horror type thriller based on the idea of religious murders. plus, there are Adam's visions, revealed in a chilling line up of scenes from the times Daddy Meiks laid his bare hands on the captured' demons'. A couple of plot twists and an eerie finale makes for your moneys worth. It's a solid story with some great twists at the end, several of them, all believable, all fun, and best of all, obscured well enough to make them true twists. This is a strong, well - conceived horror tale about a devout, but demented man in Thurman, Texas that goes on a murdering spree after getting orders from God to eliminate demons trying to control mankind."
3675,"If you insist on flashy amusements and naive happy endings in your films, this is not for you. It is a terrific movie that deals with very real problems in life and the miracle of Change. This movie will leave you with your heart a-flutter in your Chest. You Will Truly be left with a feeling of Supreme satisfaction and Dazzlement at how the film played out before your eyes. Through the move he gets in touch with his troubled son Sam (Hayden Christensen) and ex-wife Robin (Kristin Scott Thomas) a lot of anger in the beginning of the movie that transforms into smiles and laughter, it's amazing to see how the characters change so much."
3346,"Like Blade Runner and 2001, this is a film that will be properly judged in 10/20 years or maybe more. Haley Joel Osment is amazing, the robot / human emotion must be amazingly difficult to pull off effectively, but Osment does it with such relative ease to the point where you do believe he is a robot, not that he is just acting as a robot. Jude Law is excellent, and so to is Frances O'Conner. Forget everything about the Spielberg / Kubrick "" issue "" and just sit back and take in a truely amazing film. Steven Spielberg's latest movie A. I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, which he took up at the encouragement of the late, great Stanley Kubrick, has caused widely divergent comments."
3676,"The Coen brothers take great advantage of their stars' granite physiognomy throughout "" The Man That Wasn't There, "" constructing several shots around Thornton staring into a point just slightly away from the camera, impassive as an Easter Island head, moving only to smoke an ever - present cigarette while the obligatory noir voice - over narration runs. Michael Badalucco puts in a hilarious turn as Thornton's gabby brother - in - law, Frances McDormand is effective in her relatively few scenes as his brittle wife, and James Gandolfini plays yet another boorish tough guy to a turn. The Coens' signature in there: being visually very conscious, especially for their film noir venture, they must have spent a huge amount of time to find the best possible faces for every single shot. Instead, you'll just be intrigued by the wonderful story that the Coens - who have become quite the master of their craft - have weaved in this beautifully textured, perfectly cast, and incredibly nuanced film. Joel and Ethan Coens' The Man Who Wasn't There doesn't (how could it) top their first film - noir classic Blood Simple, but it is still an incredibly stylish and acted with pizazz type of film which should definitely get better with multiple viewings."
4642,"While movies like Blade Runner, Gattaca and Dark City illustrate the potential to artificially> produce live <together with its uncontrollable feedbacks, Avalon plays in a world were life is worth nothing, since it is thought to be artificial. Also, the contrast between fantasy and reality is much more vivid here than in the Matrix movies - and that's especially apparent toward the end of the movie where the viewer is left to wonder just what (if anything) is ultimately real, and what is simply imagined. If you are ready to take a film not as only entertainment, but also a challenge to your thinking power, Avalon, like all Oshii's movies, is a thrill. Everything looks absolutely gorgeous, especially when you compare the original shots with the result. Take a quiet place, wind down from the hassle of your day and let yourself sink into illusions which might even show the occasional glint of YOUR reality."
3921,"Obsession, combined with jealousy, was the impetus for an incident that occurred in November of 1924, aboard the yacht of media mogul William Randolph Hearst, and which in the years since has become the stuff of Hollywood legend and lore. The film is highlighted by a number of excellent and memorable performances, beginning with Herrmann as Hearst. Once a powerful force in a young Hollywood, Thomas Ince (Cary Elwes)--who had formed Triangle Films with D. W. Griffith and Mack Sennett, and later founded Paramount Studios with Adolph Zukor--has fallen on hard times. The story has many versions, but the ` whisper told most often,' is the one recounted in ` The Cat's Meow,' directed by Peter Bogdanovich, a dramatization of what may or may not have happened during that extended weekend birthday - party cruise in honor of pioneer film director, Thomas Ince, which included an eclectic guest list of the rich, famous and powerful. And, his birthday aside, he has decided to mix business with pleasure during this cruise, pitching an idea to Hearst (Edward Herrmann), to combine their resources and make movies together."
3922,"Human Nature is funny, original, and has a message to give to the viewers. As he managed to do in Being John Malkovich, brilliant writer Kaufman succeeds in creating a completely believable alternative reality, which he employs as a metaphor that pokes seemingly light (and therefore lethally subversive) fun at' society' - what it means to be civilized, what it means to be free, how people judge each other based on ridiculously superficial differences of appearance, etc, etc. . There are many different kinds of movies. Rhys Ifans is absolutely wonderful in his portayal of the apotheosis of the destructive nature of language on human emotion. One of the funniest scenes in the movie was when Puff (Rhys Ifans) is shown a slide of a naked woman on a projector and he instinctively lunges at the picture trying to' get some . '"
6850,"Ringo Lam delivers some great action scenes and explots Van Damme's physical ability to great affect making Replicant a good movie. Unlike his other movies where he just kicks and punches to the plot he actually does some good acting. Rooker also looks a great deal younger and in better shape than in THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS or THE BONE COLLECTOR, playing a more youthfully - minded loner as opposed to a tired old sheriff or something. For a van Damme movie the action is very rare and except maybe two scenes not very spectacular. in film and literature, and much deeper and more clever notions have been spun than this."
3677,"A kid has cried wolf a couple of times so the police don't bother to follow up when he claims he saw his step father murder someone; yes, that's very realistic. He gives a convincing performance, capturing the motivations of his character effectively with all the conflict one would expect from a kid in his situation. A rerun of every domestic situation thriller of the past two decades (everything from "" Pacific Heights "" to "" The Hand That Rocks the Cradle ""), its one saving grace is its excellent performances: Matt O'Leary, who was also fantastic as Fenton in the brilliant "" Frailty "", gives a very intelligent mature perfromance; John Travolta makes a likeable hero, while Vince Vaughan is good as the creepy villian (much better than his camp performance as Norman Bates in Gus Van Sant's pointless remake of "" Psycho ""); and Teri Polo does the best she can with the role of damsel - in - distress. The acting, story everything about this movie has been done before."
3678,"Monsters, Inc. is an in - genius corporation that has scientifically learned how to channel children's screams into energy that is used for electrical power. It has monster employees, an assembly line of doors (which give monsters access to children's bedrooms), a top - flight training program and some of the top Monsters in the scaring business. There's a colorful Metropolis, filled with houses, buildings, businesses, cars and everything that makes a city run smoothly along with a population of colorful creatures. Their job is to protect the Metropolis of Monsters, Inc. from human contamination. He becomes attached to Boo (voice of Mary Gibbs) a cute, little big - eyed girl who is mysteriously brought to Monsters, Inc. and in his quest to return her home becomes very attached to her."
3804,"Roughly one part crime drama to two parts offbeat love story, ` Birthday Girl' is a nifty little British film that gives Nicole Kidman a chance to strut her stuff as an actress. The scenes of her puffing away on a cigarette casually hanging from the side of her mouth were hilarious. The two Russian accomplices were also good, and Ben Chaplin was suitably uptight as the "" victim "". The pace of the film is fast and captivating, and you certainly are not ready to quit watching when the end titles appear, you rather feel that you're in the middle of the plot, and are left with a desire to see the sequel as soon as it comes out. Though innately compassionate, Nadia has had to learn how to survive in a brutal world - even if that means having to exploit naÃ¯ve, good - natured shmucks like John."
4367,"In fact, it is the transition Jettel undergoes throughout the course of the story that makes ` Nowhere in Africa' such a fascinating film. For Jettel is clearly the most interesting and complex character in the movie. Haughty and coldly superior at the outset, she eventually comes to see the beauty of ` differences' that exist between peoples and cultures, an appreciation that, paradoxically, brings home for her the universal nature of human beings. The relationship between Walter and Jettel is a truly complex one; they are not a conventionally happily married couple, but rather one torn apart by their different, often - conflicting views of the world and their somewhat shaky love for one another. All the actors are superb, with Juliane Kohler as Jettel proving a particular standout."
3589,"Well, Freddie Prinze is the hot shot pitcher trying to make his mark in life while mowing lawns. Prinze gives his usual "" cute boy who smiles a lot "" routine, and Matthew Lillard also gives his usual "" side - kick to Freddy Prinze Jr. "" routine. Marc Blucas (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) also has a memorable performance, although again his talents are avoided to give Prinze and Jessica Biel more kissing screen - time. Biel and Prinze interact like marble statues, nice to look at but no chemistry whatever. Fans of Prinze and Biel will enjoy seeing them look sexy for an hour and three quarters."
3679,"But forget the fictional character's skill--just the skill you'd need as a stuntman or stuntwoman making this movie to perform some of these stunts is truly impressive! This is a movie definitely worth renting, but not worth buying unless its the Special Edition DVD or its VHS for under 10 bucks. There are many universes, you look quite similar in everyone and your all connected by a wave of energy. It isn't entirely devoid of those annoyances, but is much better than most. Plus Jet L is pretty damn cool, and he's made some interesting movies in Asia."
3935,"But other than that this film has so many beautiful poetic moments that it's worth watching. the somewhat older poet laureate of sorts, "" haunting "" the halls decked in a t - shirt and baseball cap quoting beautiful, inspiring poetry. It has moments of brilliance but it is in dire need of plot structure."
3681,"The' tricked - ya tricked - ya tricked - ya' type endings are about as creative as a dream - sequence ending. There are some nice scenes around the airport though, some memorable dialogue ("" everybody needs money, that's why it's called money ""), and it's always fun to watch great professionals like Hackman, Rockwell and DeVito. Though he'll probably be best remember for "" Hoosiers, "" and with respects to DeNiro in films such as "" Heat "" & "" The Score, "" Hackman is the most accomplished actor in films such as this, whether as a cop ("" The French Connection ""), a private - eye ("" Night Moves ""), a technician ("" The Conversation, "" "" Enemy of the State ""), a spy ("" Target "") or even an attorney ("" Under Suspicion ""). Fine production values, understated but effective actions scenes & an above - average music score help Hackman & Co. make "" Heist "" a watchable rather than forgettable thriller. The performances were all great - however the writing talents were not well suited for actors of this caliber."
3682,"Not because this film is laugh - out - loud funny--it's funny, but not hilarious--but because it has a great heart and delivers a beautiful message without any corny Hollywood pretentions. Sure, the premise is funny--a shallow guy gets virtually hypnotized into thinking all the unattractive women he sees are foxes and ends up going out with a 500 - pound woman who he also thinks is a fox. It's a great premise, but the Farrellys don't fixate on that premise alone, preventing it from turning it into a lame, one - joke slapstick comedy. Gwyneth Paltrow is adorable and sweet, capturing the audience's sympathy with her winning smile. The story is solid, with no boring lulls."
3586,"Another critic panned the casting of Elizabeth (Saved by the Bell, Showgirls) Berkley with such actors as Helen Hunt, Dan Aykroyd, Wally Shawn, et al. . she looks great in the 40s outfits and her verbal sparring with Allen was hilarious; Charlize Theron looks fantastic but is shamefully wasted and (in a huge surprise) Elizabeth Berkeley actually gives a halfway decent performance! Sexy and rich socialite Laura Kensington, portrayed by the beautiful 26 year - old Charlize Theron, is attracted to Biggs because he the antithesis of her past conquests: something new and different. David Ogden Stires always gives a good performance, and was able to shake the shadow of M * A * S * H's Maj. Winchester for a dead - perfect evil magician. Better yet, try and imagine that the lines are being delivered by someone with a ski - jump nose."
3684,"All the comedians play their parts well and Eminem's character is hilarious. All in all The wash is a great Comedy that's laid back and filled with cameos by Ludicrous, Xzibit, Pierre, Kurupt, Shaq, Pauly Shore, and Tommy Chong. Dre, Snoop, Corrupt, and Eminem, what a lineup,, the wash was a pretty decent movie about a pair of guys who get hired at a Car Wash so they can make some legitimate dough. There are a lot of cameos such as Ludacris, Kurupt, Eminem, Xzibit and Shaquille O'Neal. Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre star here (not there first film together, the better film Training Day comes to mind) as two guys who usually have what most young urban professionals want - weed, hoes and uh, bling bling."
3685,"Indeed, many classic children's movies, like "" The Wizard of Oz "" and "" Mary Poppins, "" are so successful partly because they're so different from the books that inspired them. And much of what makes the Harry Potter phenomenon unique is that it is the first time in ages that a children's book, without a movie accompanying it, has generated this much popularity. The remaining adult actors, including Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, are as good as they possibly could be, and the kids do an excellent job of holding their own against these veterans. The gently satirical aspects of Hogwarts School aren't in the movie at all. Lines like the following--"" Professor McGonagall watched [her students] turn a mouse into a snuffbox--points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers ""--find no equivalent in the movie."
3393,"This film is not another "" Scary Movie "" made for teens: It has divinely orchestrated comic timing. The film has a very nice co-star cast: Victor Garber ("" Titanic, "" "" Sleepless in Seattle ""), Luke Wilson ("" Blue Streak, "" "" Charlie's Angels ""), and Selma Blair ("" The Sweetest Thing, "" A Guy Thing ""--pretty much anyTHING). In the end, not only does "" Legally Blonde "" come off very funny, but also very witty, good - natured and sweet: One of the most pleasant surprises of 2001, indeed."
3686,"One of the movies he rents from a local video store is the classic Citizen Kane, however hapless individuals at the video rental place have somehow mixed it up with hot adult flick' Citizen Cum'. It is this accidental mix up of tapes that gives birth to a lengthy and powerful obsession Sean develops for the porn - star star of Citizen Cum, Johnny Rebel, played perfectly by Scott Gurney. The Fluffer is an interesting film, which has surprisingly little nudity and sexy considering where the story is based. Read more and find out where this film made it in the Top 50 Most Influential Gay Movies of All Time book, click this link. Mikey (a. k. a. Johnny Rebel) is a star in the gay porn industry, yet claims to be heterosexual."
3936,"To solve these mysteries, Tom recruits Claire's best friend, Hester Wallace (Kate Winslet). The possibility of a spy within the British code - breakers' ranks is raised, and Tom's love interest, Claire (Saffron Burrows), has disappeared. Dougray Scott, in a very different role from his ` Mission Impossible 2' outing, has lost weight to portray brilliant, but tortured, code - breaker Tom Jericho at Britain's war - time Bletchley Park; Kate Winslet put on weight (she was pregnant at the time) for a performance far removed from ` Titantic' as the frumpy, but clever, Hester; and Jeremy Northam is excellent as the sardonic secret service agent Wigram who knows far more than he is prepared to reveal. Final feature film with a full music score composed by John Barry, his music is fascinating likeness to "" Dancing with wolves "" and a lot of hits during his long career thirty years ago. It is primarily fact - based, and while, like most fact - based movies, some events are concatenated, characters combined or dramatized, the presentation oozes credibility."
3937,"The end is brilliant and is reminiscent of the other Friday the 13th movies. The fact that this is the tenth movie in the Friday the 13th franchise, the most knuckle - draggingly, ball - scratchingly cretinous' horror' series of all time AND it's set in space doesn't exactly suggest that this'll be an all - time classic, but it's a good fun way to kill an hour and thirty minutes nonetheless. This is not The Exorcist, it's not The Omen, it's even a very long way away from the original Friday The 13th, but as director James Isaac has said, "" it's just fun . "" The movie is more or less a parody of the other Friday the 13th movies and it is very funny when it wants to be. With the initial rampage through the ship resulting in a lot of cheesy goodness to come the scenes set in the futuristic landscape, the great shoot - outs both with the soldiers and the cyborg getting into the proceedings as well to generate even more good times with this one."
8479,"This really does a great job of grabbing the viewer's attention and will make the viewer want to keep watching the rest of the movie for anymore just - as - hilarious scenes as this one. Although it is disappointing that some of the original characters and / or actors aren't in this continance, Storms is and she has proven that she is a very talented young actress. The Zequel is in the good tradition of the previous film and good family entertainment from The Magic Kingdom. Her arch-earth-nemesis, Margie (Lauren Maltby) is in this sequel a lot more than she was in the first one and also gives a fantastic performance. Still, the important characters were still played by the same actors / actresses (Kirsten Storms, Lauren Maltby, Stuart Pankin and Phillip Rhys as Proto Zoa.)"
3939,"It's a great documentary in the way that it is put together, though Stacey Peralta always knew how to do this even when producing the Bones Brigade mini movies / skate demos like "" Ban This "" and "" Search for Animal Chin . "" A close - up look at the birth of skate board culture in Southern California, Dogtown and Z - Boys has attitude to burn, just like the sport it documents. Even if you are not a fan you'll be fascinated by the story, which is told using a combination of narration, stills, great vintage 1970s skate boarding footage and new interviews with all the key players. Directed by Stacy Peralta, one of the legends of the sport, it captures the punk rock spirit of skate boarding, and perfectly places it into context within the boundaries of time (the 1970s) and location (a neighbourhood between Santa Monica and Venice, California). There are also interviews of folks like Tony Hawk (obviously), Ian McKaye (Fugazi), and Henry Rollins, who were young kids in the 70s when Dogtown was making it's influence on skateboarding (skateboarding was a whole other context in previous years as the documentary explains)."
3687,"He is hilarious as the method actor in search of ways to interpret the real life detective in the movies. The most remarkable scenes are those of the great Kevin Bacon as an actor tailing David Keith in preparation for an upcoming police film. That said, the story has a lot of laughs and it was a complete surprise given the negative comments one had heard about this film. "" Novocaine "" is a sweet ball of darkness, laughs and film noir. with a fiancÃ© / co-worker, Jean (Laura Dern), and a generally nice, peaceful little world."
3278,""" "" One Night at McCool's "" marks the feature film directorial debut of Zwart, an award winning commercial and music video director who began making short films when he was eight years old.

For Randy, she lights a few fires, both positive and negative, the later persuading him to contact a bingo playing hit man named Burmeister (Michael Douglas) to put an end to her deceptive ways. Dehling sees Jewel as a beautiful, mesmerizing gift from God. Carl sees Jewel as two sexy legs and lots of cleavage."
3688,"The reactions and mannerisms of the medieval people are stretched at best, and Lawrence's reactions aren't quite how you'd expect a normal person to act, were he thrown back in time. Without giving anything away, there's a contrived dance scene that arises well into the movie."
8535,"The best thing about this movie is that its title is numerical, so it shows up among the first DVDs on Blockbuster's "" New Releases "" wall. In spite of a couple of witty lines that enlighten about 20 seconds of this 80 - minute wreck, it remains a quite atrocious viewing experience sunk by porn - level acting, music and editing; a whiny and uninteresting central character; atrocious camera work; not to mention plot holes the size of Julia Roberts' nostrils. with there cowboy hats and perfect everything. he is funny, sweet and yeas sexy. "" Regular gay guy "" (to quote the DVD box) Josh has a hissey fit when he catches his lover of 10 years receiving oral sex from someone he has."
3689,"None of the acting is over the top or explicit; most everything is controlled, subtle, and delicately handled. The soundtrack, by Harry Gregson - Williams, masterfully captures the various time periods, spicing the scenes with a slick sense of style and intrigue."
3690,"The school is destitute, barely able to provide enough food for the children, but headmistress Carmen and Dr. Casares do the best they can. The acting is superb, from the children as well as the adults. Guillermo del Toro has made a masterpiece with "" The Devils Backbone . "" Ten stars for this hauntingly lovely epic. On the higher slopes nothing grows except stunted shrubs and heath, with the white bones of the limestone sticking out everywhere."
3691,"The valuable and rare thing here is that the story works against the most common plot at the movies today: the revenge plot. Though difficult to watch, it is a great film, great story, with great performances all around by gifted actors. Obviously, this movie will be getting a good deal of Oscar attention due to the performances by Spacek, Wilkinson, Tomei, and the terrific script. In the Bedroom proves him to be quite a talented dramatic lead actor, as his performance allows him the full range of emotions, and he creates a character as believable and real as Spacek's. ' No doubt he read this interpretation from someone else's review of the film (and what a sweet piece of justice it would be if that critic were a woman)."
3345,"Maybe it is charisma, maybe it is charm, maybe it is just that he resembles some of the action heroes from the 80's with his chiseled triceps and his slabs of pecs. But F&F is all muscle and sheer bravado. This movie, has by far the best car racing scenes ever filmed, as well as the best cars. The acting is great as well, as usual Vin Diesel gives a brilliant performance, as Dominic Toretto. A long time producer and Harvard graduate, Cohen has achieved success a director, with movies such as Dragonheart, The Skulls, Daylight, Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story (which he also wrote and starred in) and several episodes of the series Miami Vice."

4415,"From ultra-light planes to hot air balloons, to hang gliders the camera operators managed to capture what must be the most amazing shots of flying ever filmed. The colors and the backgrounds behind the different species are photographed with such an eye to detail that one wonders the miracle of the technology behind it. It's surprising that this documentary has been shown in art houses to grown ups, mainly. An extraordinary film, great landscapes, great birds. With the help of 450 individuals, including 17 pilots and 14 cinematographers, directors Jacques Perrin, Michael Debats and Jacques Cluzaud, bring to life the migrating habits of a variety of birds throughout the world."
4817,"Rivers and Tides is a quiet study of some of the artwork and methods of Andy Goldsworthy, who makes his art entirely out of things in nature, generally resulting in pieces that will be consumed by nature through the normal process of entropy. Whether or not you appreciate certain aspects of how this film is presented, Goldsworthy's work is moving enough to overlook that, because the film is not the star, Goldsworthy's art is. Andy Goldsworthy has managed to create an amalgam of all of these aspects of his life that looks like it works very well, and is nourishing for him and those around him. This cinematic production directed by Thomas Riedelsheimer with the beautiful and appropriately haunting music by Fred Frith is not to be missed. It's a nice film, and it creates a sort of warm and pleasant feeling for the engaging and dedicated Andy Goldsworthy, the 47 - year - old Scottish artist who makes perishable environmental pieces whom this doc is exclusively concerned with."
3326,"While this film is far from a masterpiece, Evolution deserves better ratings than it currently enjoys here at IMDb. This movie makes no pretensions--it's a simple, fun summer movie full of special effects. The cast handles its duties in a professional manner, and there are enough laughs to keep you entertained throughout the movie. "" Evolution, "" starring David Duchovny, Orlando Jones, Seann William Scott and Julianne Moore, is a terrific fun summer romp. A meteorite crashes to Earth, bringing with it microscopic alien organisms that rapidly begin evolving and threaten humanity's very existence."
3718,"Twenty years after he made his adult film debut Ron Jeremy is still a porn star, only these days he is a chunky, sloppy one who commands a following largely due to his unlikely appearance and quasi-comic persona and who continues the career thanks to that near - inhuman control. The main thing that distinguishes him from your run of the mill addict is that his addictions are or have been food, sex, and attention, not drugs or alcohol. There are also some celebrity interviews for good measure."
3719,Freshly released from jail Danny Ocean begins to recruit key players to put together a job as daring as it is dangerous - the safe that holds the money for 3 casinos belonging to Terry Benedict. However it takes up little screen time and compliments the heist quite well. Instead he does his stuff but allows others to try and shine while he is comfortable with a constant warm glow. Affleck and Cann are good in a sort of comedy double act role - they don't have a lot of scenes but they are funny. Old hands Gould (so good to see him on the big screen) and Carl Riener effortlessly steal all their scenes and Matt Damon seems happy to be on a smaller part than the other stars and has a rookie sort of role.
3720,"With the way love and sex is treated in many movies, it was wonderful to see how one could feel the love and devotion of one person of another without as much as a touch or kiss. The actors and actresses have very realistic performances, showing an excellent direction and the character Baran does not speak any word along the story, using only her facial expression to disclose her inner feelings. See how just the closeness of their arms and hands to each other evoke such passionate feelings and the way they dig deep into each others eyes is wonderful. It has strong appeal because of the natural performances of its non-professional actors, its well - drawn characters, and its message of the transforming power of generosity. Its unusual to find such a philosophical film that keeps both your eyes and heart wide awake."
3721,""" The Business of Strangers "" is a stylish piece of work, but it's a bit fraudulent. This man, who, up until he is taken advantage of, appears to be a cordial and sympathetic businessman, is cruelly victimized for no real reason, yet he doesn't seem to suffer anything more than a little bit of confusion. Usually this makes a good movie but in this case it's hard to believe someone as powerful as Channing's CEO would allow Paula to order them around. It is the surprise revelations about the characters that happen every couple of minutes that keep you fascinated throughout. THE BUSINESS OF STRANGERS looks good and has solid performances."
4429,"And yet it soon became clear that beyond the realistic and compassionate guidance of a truly dedicated counselor (played to standing - ovation intensity by Don Cheadle), the only hope for them was to be stimulated into opening their hearts to each other and in this way discovering meaning beyond their personal demons. Without a doubt one of the best scenes was a spontaneous mosh pit that erupted around the playing of a cassette of the Deftones. An open examination of teenagers with destructive mental illness, societies need to create and control them, and their own quest for control in their lives. If you are looking a feel good movie with all the answers, this film is not for you. Cheadle manages to give a layered performance that shows an obvious connection to the kids in his care, professional skill at helping them, a mild touch of cynicism as to the extent people really can change and hints of battling problems of his own."
3259,"Ashley Judd stars in ` Someone Like You', a pleasant romantic comedy that lets her stretch her acting chops. There are no surprises, some smiles and chuckles, and you'll feel good because the characters are basically nice folks. Someone Like You or Animal Attraction as it's called over here in the UK, is a charming romantic comedy starring Ashley Judd who plays Jane Goodale, a woman who is quite unlucky in love until she meets Ray Brown played by Greg Kinnear who sweeps her off her feet, but when he breaks up with her, she's down in the dumps again. Along the way, as Jane draws her final conclusions, there are some memorable--and at times, humorous--moments, like when Jane revives one of her old cheerleader routines for Eddie. Someone Like You is about finding out what makes men do the things they do in relationships (or the beginning of relationships) and of course falling in love."
3722,"What makes this film worth more that one watch is that it takes human life at its most vulnerable, that it is about communication or lack of thereof, the excellent use of international cast and different languages adding to the confusion of an understanding the conflict that was truly not understood by anyone. No Man's Land & another Bosnian co-production, Saviour, both stand as two of the best films on the subject of war made in the past decade. This is such a sad story with plenty of extremely touching scenes. There were a lot of scenes which are funny, and all the viewers laughed and clapped for the witty statements."
3723,"Writer - director Leon Ichaso put together a structured montage of PiÃ±ero's biographic snapshots with his works: plays, TV dramas, poetry readings, intermingled with signs of the times of 60s, 70s news clips: Nixon stepping out of Air Force One, Reagan dodging his assassination attempt on his life, image of Ayatollah and political crowds. As you watch this film, keep you eye on Bratt's honest moments. Many of the scenes are very intense, involving strong language, drug use, sexual content, and ideas that may shock some viewers. This might throw some viewers off and come across as "" choppy "", but really captures an artistic feel that fits the character. In a time when Hollywood's creations are lagging in creativity and spirit, this is a refreshing change."
3258,"Valdean jo's mother played by hilarious actress sally field is too busy focusing on jo's ex boyfriend jacks money and does her best to break the two lovers apart. After arranging an appointment with vick vetors valdean reveals that jo and gilly are siblings! But it still has that Farrelly vibe, since J. B. Rogers worked as the A. D. in their previous works. Fans who like her best during her Gidget / Flying Nun years will be just as surprised as those who praise her for Sybil, Norma Rae, Places in the Heart, and similar TV - Movies & tear - jerkers. Jones is very funny, and brings in the film's biggest laughs."
3727,"Brilliantly hilarious, "" AmÃ©lie "" has a wonderfully funny script and is brought to life in visual splendor by director Jean - Pierre Jeunet ("" Alien: Resurrection "", of all things) and has at its center Audrey Tatou giving one of the warmest, most sincere and funniest performances you'll see this year. The story is not only sweet and charming, it has some great moments of comedy as well. Short analysis on Jean - Pierre Jeunet's Le fabuleux destin d'AmÃ©lie Poulain For 20 years Jean - Pierre Jeunet collected small astonishing and intriguing moments in his life, taking notes in his diary, not knowing that he was up to co-write and direct one of the most successful film in French film history. Not a lot of movies create their own sort of universe. It contains so many details and switches in tempo and camerawork it has to be seen more than once to take in and understand everything."
3257,"Pacy for sure, and often funny if not always in what the late British DJ Kenny Everett's Cupid Stunt character called "" the best possible taste "" (witness the oral sex gags early on), there's a distinct slowing down as the tale unfolds and Jen's growing feelings for a potential mark (Jason Lee) makes it more sentimental than cynics would like; the first half of the movie is funnier and edgier than the second. A key one is when Weaver, keen to prove that she is, ahem, Russian, does her rendition of The Beatles' "" Back in U. S. S. R. "" There are some snappy one - liners, amusing physical comedy (Gene Hackman dying never seemed so funny). Her rendition of "" back in the U. S. S. R "" was hilarious yet catchy. Max wants her to go for his pocketbook, but Page really has feelings for this person - even though romance is against her better judgment. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sigourney Weaver deliver performances that are both sexy and funny."
3728,"It is, unlike many other movies that attempt to be like it, a true satire, taking characters and not just doing stupid things with them, but exaggerating the traits of their serious counterparts and, when it comes down to it, just making fun of them. Even though some of the jokes are very vulgar, it is a funny movie and it does make fun of the most popular stereotypes that you can find in teen movies. And yes, it's full of actresses in their late 20's with big boobs pretending to be teenagers. Not Another Teen Movie makes fun of movies from the 80's to the 90's and is very clever. There's an hilarious running gag spoofing "" Cruel Intentions, "" in which the slutty sister will stop at nothing to bed her brother, high school football hero Jake Wyler, who makes a bet with his team members that he can turn plain - jain, boy - hating Janie Griggs into the prom queen."
3254,"Semi-interesting characters, a few plot twists here and there, steady, interesting action, flashy directing, decent performances, plenty of cool explosions, exciting car chases, and numerous excellent violent death scenes. His action scenes are always fun to watch. Some of the most incredible action sequences in Exit Wounds will forever be embedded in the Joel Silver legacy. In one of the most powerful scenes of the movie, Boyd is shown hanging up his whistle after his demotion to a traffic director. DMX delivers the most engaging performance in Exit Wounds."
3729,"He's made some interesting career choices the past few years, with films like ` Magnolia' and ` Eyes Wide Shut' merely warm - ups for the very real and complex character he creates here. All of their interactions, and the consequences of them, make Vanilla Sky one of the most emotional, and complex thrillers ever made. Particularly, "" Njosnavelin "" by Sigur Ros, which is an amazing song. The theme will really get you to "" open your eyes "". The casual, relaxed, "" not looking to think too hard "" group of movie - goers are left confused when the plot takes a complete 180 at the end of the movie."
3730,"Seeing Iris through Bayley's loving eyes is what makes the film an enriching experience. Kate Winslet and Hugh Bonneville (uncannily resembling a young Broadbent) are very true to their older counterparts' personalities, and add yet another dimension to film. While the later Alzheimer years are important and interesting, too much of the film dwelled on these latter years. It has three very good actors and one truly great complex one (Winslet). The co-screenwriter did some multidimensional work in the past."
3969,"Like "" American History X, "" this movie contains disturbing scenes where the protagonist articulately expresses his bigoted ideas. His intimate knowledge of Jewish beliefs and practices looks strange to his fellow skinheads, to say the least. Ironically, the film is likely to resonate the most with Jews, though it also contains universal themes familiar to anyone who has ever struggled with faith. Full - fledged Nazis, ironically, will not like many of the directions this movie takes, and neither might serious Jews â€” the views expressed in this film are that strong. And his behavior stems from his own education, his rebellion against the Torah: Abraham did really kill his own son, the Jew was made to comply with God's commandments; the hero finds similarities between the Nazis's and the Jews's beliefs; both are the Chosen ones."
4450,"And during the big party, the god father is terrific trying to make sure that one lady has everything she wants to see at the party. Like so many gay movies, there is so much potential here, but it never matured during the artistic process. There were several chuckle - worthy scenes, although watching them try to cook was more a' laugh in horror' kind of thing. Having grown up during the time when a lot of these stereotypes were the only "" role models "" gay people had it is really amusing to see someone finally making fun of them. And one of the film's strongest elements is the way it sends up and subverts stereotypes rather than exploit them."
3731,"Afghan and Indian music was distributed secretly at great risk during the Taliban reign. Aadhaaya Divya Kusumaani Manoharaani Sreepaada Poojana Vidhim Bhavadanghri Mooley Karthum Mahothsukathayaa Pravishanti Bhakthaah Sri Sathya Sai Bhagawan Thava Suprabhatham (Meaning: Bringing holy flowers with captivating colors and fragrance, for worshipping Thy Lotus Feet, in the form as prescribed by the scriptures, Thy devotees are coming in, with great yearning and enthusiasm. The film's great success with audiences was in part due to the timing of its release, at a moment when Afghanistan had been catapulted into the headlines by the activities of the Taliban and the attacks of September 11, 2001 The film does not attempt to make a political analysis of the situation of Afghanistan in 2001, but operates on a more humanistic and emotional level, showing the human consequences, the poverty both material and spiritual of life under the Taliban and the indifference of the outside world. Hidden beneath her own burka, she witnesses firsthand the devastating poverty, the utter degradation and de-humanization of women, and the authoritarian oppression that defined life in that country during the Taliban rule."
3277,"Opening with the arresting image of beautiful blonde babe Izabella Miko washing blood off her bare breasts in the shower, culminating with an exciting explosive climax, with a handy helping of graphic gore, raucous roaring rock music and rousing vehicular action sandwiched in between, this delightfully down 'n' dirty low - budget Grade B exploitation horror flick sizes up as a tasty trashy treat. Writer / director J. S. ("" The Slayer, "" "" Shadowzone "") Cardone elicits sound performances from the entire cast (veteran late, great character actress Carrie Snodgress in particular contributes a lively last reel cameo as a feisty old battle axe), keeps the unflagging pace fast 'n' furious throughout, and, most importantly, delivers the unapologetically lowdown sleazy goods with a winning dearth of pretense and a hugely satisfying surplus of rip - snorting panache. A b - rate horror movie that has vampires. While it's not nearly as good as those three flicks, it certainly is an interesting and occasionally intriguing picture. Unlike most teen horror films that have come out in the past five years, it is smart, original, and is actually scary at times."
3732,"Lawrence clearly intended the title - referring to a tropical shrub with beautiful flowers that hide dense, thorny undergrowth - to represent the characters' private lives hidden behind an outward appearance. This sincere, uncompromising picture places the lack of communication at the center of family problems. A must see for mature realists into serious drama. "" Lantana "" investigates real people who deal with real situations and encounter real consequences. "" Lantana "" is one of those rare films which which transcends entertainment with meaningful messages, however subliminal, while avoiding the dumbing - down, flocking, hype, titillation, and other excesses of the usual Tinseltown product and relying solely on good story telling."
3743,"By the end of this movie you will love the movies, love America, and love Jim Carrey. The way he gets the town to rally around the Majestic is fun and wonderful. Every other movie staring Jim Carrey, no matter how serious, you could still see a little bit of Ace Ventura coming out. He is content to live surrounded by people who admire him, Luke's girlfriend Adele, and work in the Majestic movie theater, unaware that he has both another life and a government agency waiting to catch up to him. Totally enjoyed this trip through nostalgiatown as Carrey rejuvenated a town with his infectious personality."
3733,"The Tenenbaum's dysfunction (while amplified for the screen) is quite an accurate portrayal of family life. The Tenenbaums are a dysfunctional family â€“ the parents have been separated for decades, and Royal (Gene Hackman) is a disbarred attorney who has long since moved out of the family's enormous house (in an unnamed city of course). ' The Royal Tenenbaums' has a phenomenal cast, and all of the actors are excellent in the film. ' The Royal Tenenbaums' is a brilliant film that is both emotional and eye - catching, and truly cements Wes Anderson as an exciting and talented filmmaker. The Tenenbaums are a wealthy New York family of eccentric genuises, headed by Angelica Huston."
3739,"Method Man was more or less the straight man but the rest of the ensemble cast provided enough laughs to split your sides. Especially notable was Mike Epps who portrayed Babypowder the Pimp. Unless you smoked a lot of "" grass "" back in the 70's. The rappers play Silas and Jamal, two young men who live for their pot and sexing. He is able to give them the answers to all the questions on their SATs and that allows them to go to any college they want, and so they pick Harvard."
3614,"Hardball shows the very gritty, dangerous life of some inner city kids who are not only trying to survive, but to find some - thing worth caring about - in this case, baseball. What is unique to this movie is it's view of the kids off the field - their lives in housing projects, the dangers, drugs and problems they face just living every day. Very solid jobs by cast, including Keanu Reeves, who does a fabulous job as the shiftless / compulsive gambler / reluctant coach who becomes much more to his team after realizing these kids actually have a rougher life than his own. The young, unknown boys give outstanding performances which are matched by a moving performance by Keanu Reeves. In spite of its rather predictable set up Hardball is remarkably effective."
4458,"Proposals aside, once again, Brody proves why he deserved his Oscar (and that kiss from Halle Berry). He gives a beautiful, touching performance here as a charming, rakish, snakeskin - jacket - wearing con artist who falls in love with a girl from the right side of the tracks. He keeps a secret storage unit seperate from the apartment he shares with his partner - in - crime Charlie (Jon Seda), where he keeps first editions of classic novels (he has a penchant for Melville) and works on his own novel. Claire tells him she likes movies best that make her cry, and he does his best to oblige her, ultimately sending her on a self - destructive bender that makes him look like a good boy. Brody carries this film, and the lovely Charlotte Ayanna is unfortunately not given nearly as much to work with."
3253,"And Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz and Ed Harris all give superb performances. It is easily superior to the likes of Platoon, the equal of more esoteric war films such as Three Kings, and it is miles above the likes of Saving Private Ryan and Pearl Harbour. A lot of historians have it that the battle of Stalingrad was the most unpleasant one fought during the second World War, and this film's set design and cinematography capture that impeccably. Writer / Director Jean - Jacques Annaud, writer Alain Goddard, and cinematographer Robert Fraisse treat the subject matter with great care towards authenticity and entertainment value. The real surprise here, however, is Rachel Weisz as Sergeant Tania Chernova, and the very heart and soul of the film."
4464,"More often than not, it's simply cloudy and ill - defined values. The warmth of scenes in the family's church were well juxtaposed with the sterile wood paneled cortroom."
3740,"There's some incredible computer animation, hysterically funny lines (for kids and adults) and a VERY quick pace that make up for a few dull moments and a really silly script. There are lots of funny lines in this animated movie and some funny characters, at least for adults. Carl, Jimmy's best friend is a llama - loving dunce while Sheen is "" Ultra-Lord "" obsessed - an EXCELLENT parody on the fan boy generation. Whilst it may not have the adult humour of other animations (mainly the greatest animation of them all, "" Shrek ""), it does still have the occasional funny joke that will make people of all ages laugh. The animation is very good and nicely detailed, the humor is simple and G - rated for kids, which will please adults, and the story is fast - paced and creative."
3741,"That all said, it is a charming movie that could have been a blockbuster hit the likes of Sleepless but is not. In the end they overcome all problems and will live happily ever after. He is so charming and charismatic that you can hardly resist falling head over heels for him! Some of their scenes together are the best in the movie. If you keep it at 100 or so years separation, it would still be around 1 / 16th shared blood."
3742,"Another good movie to see after FOTR is TTT, of course. It is the second part of this great trilogy and there are more climatic scenes. Overall, it's a great movie to see and it is really worth spending the money to buy / rent the extended / special DVD to watch too. Of course, it helps that Jackson insisted on at least a 2 picture deal, & New Line Cinema was brave enough to foot the bill up front for 3 movies. The story, sets, costumes & FX are so rich, you'll have to see the film several times to absorb everything."
3744,"This movie provided a brilliant (pardon the pun) insight into many aspects of a genius at work. While love is a common basis in most movies, the interaction of this theme with other aspects of the plot was planned phenomenlly. Added to that the stellar performances of Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris and Adam Goldberg, and this made for the' perfect' movie. A Beautiful Mind Director Ron Howard has experience in playing with his audience's heartstrings. And plucking heartstrings is not a bad thing at all, not when you can do it in such a sincere, noncloying way as the masterful Beautiful Mind presents to its viewers."
3276,"This is definitely one of Sly's better movies. She's been great in other movies like Bound and especially The Insider. But overall it is quite entertaining with the racing scenes and the variety of locations they go to. The ONLY technical aspect of racing that they got right was the fact that the cars, at least SOME of the time, had four wheels. it has a great plot, good action scenes and a kick ass soundtrack."
3344,"Dr. John Dolittle has become famous for his ability to communicate with animals, but lately, he has also been having trouble with his family. Its amazing how well they can train bears, some of the stunts are incredible. Like its predecessor, "" Dr. Dolittle 2 "" contains some juvenile excretion jokes, though it is a TAD cleaner, for better or worse (since it was aimed at kids, many would probably say it's for the better). This is fun for the whole family adults and children will enjoy it. The second movie Dr. Dolittle is now a rather rich doctor."
3754,"But the "" Loud mouth "" CHAMPs witty and "" punchy "" remarks in his real life along, with his big blows inside the ring, will keep you glued for more. The script is again decent, centering on several facets of the star's life that go beyond the sports pages. Michael Mann's characteristic documentary-esque filming style works well in parts, but services to alienate the viewer in others. In many cases conversations begin to rise but then only dissipate before anything really gripping has been said. From the brilliant opening 10 minutes, to the truly awe - inspiring, moving, scenes in Africa at the end, Mann carefully directs this picture, never making it dull, but also never forcing plotlines."
4515,"The making of footage on the flip side of the DVD is equally nifty, because seldom will a film include multiple agonizing takes of key scenes both action and non-action so that you might understand how excruciatingly demanding and exhausting film making can really be. Fantastic blood and bullets thriller starring Andy Lau and Takashi Sorimachi as Tok and O, two hitmen at the top of their game. Its haunting theme weave in well with the scenes, and made them alive. A fun movie with a charismatic cast and lots of blood and bullets. The action scenes were good, not too much physical action, but if you like guns, then this is right up your alley."
3755,"Some of the best performances of the film come from Tom Sizemore as the gung - ho Lt. McKnight and Josh Hartnett, who plays the sergeant who leads the mission and feels personal guilt every time a man is lost. It's amazing to watch what seems like thousands of extras playing the Somali militia swarming over the soldiers, and the action and camerawork is reminiscent of a video game as the soldiers try to escape their precarious situation through the streets of Mogadishu. When talking about war movies, there are many great ones that immediately spring to mind. Although characterization has always been used extensively in war movies to get the viewer to care about the characters, Black Hawk Down works better because, for the most part, the soldiers are personified as little more than grunts in the field doing the bidding of their superiors. And for about ninety minutes, you are subjected to some of the most intense, disturbing, graphic, violent and chilling pieces of conflict representation that you will ever see."
3757,"Robert Altman's long, fragmented and very hit - or - miss career reaches another of his periodic highs with this clever and beautifully realised dissection of the English class system and skit on the classic Agatha Christie whonunnit. These intruders are kept in their place, but the message is clear - change is coming, and coming fast. The cast are all excellent, with special mention deserving of Maggie Smith's effortless scene stealing as a bitchy but broke old Countess; the ever reliable Jeremy Northam as matinee idol Ivor Novello, well aware of his place in the great scheme of things and young Kelly Macdonald in the pivotal role of Smith's harassed maid who's inquisitiveness rattles a whole load of family skeletons. The film is at its best when it's probing the emotional depths of the story --- it comes across as a bit too glib when the satire gets especially acidic (mostly with the Kristin Scott Thomas character), but like the best of his movies ("" Nashville, "" "" M * A * S * H, "" "" Short Cuts "") Altman knows how to control his own cynicism and doesn't let sarcasm rule. Throughout the film Altman visually shows the audience the contrast between social classes through his various shots, lighting techniques, and camera filters."
3758,"Penn is highly under rated in the world that is movies, as he shows with this Oscar potential performance. The young actress who plays his daughter is amazingly mature in her acting, whilst always managing to capture the innocence of her youthfullness. That's where Rita Harrison enters, and she will not only help Sam, but learn great values with him. He lives in Santa Monica and works at Starbucks. All of the major cast members give one of the best performances of their careers, and many of these actors have had a number of artistic triumphs on their rÃ©sumÃ©s."
3759,"This film had a minuscule $4 million budget, a terrific script and a director not afraid to take some risks. Director Marc Forster conjures a forceful presentation with stark sets, next to nothing in the way of props and other set decoration, and a non existent soundtrack. This is an actors' showcase, with outstanding performances all around. Billy Bob Thornton delivers his best performance since ` Sling Blade' with a complex character torn between his prejudices and his attraction to Leticia (Halle Berry). In this film, Berry is sexy and alluring, but these are only incidental attributes."
3343,"With her mock British accent, Jolie is a lot of fun as the adventurer - archaeologist who is equal parts Bruce Wayne and Indiana Jones, but with a much better body. The script is a patchwork of ideas that plays like a Greatest Hits collection of other films. She's guided by the spirit (both literally and figuratively) of her late adventurer father, Lord Croft (Jon Voight), and assisted by an archaeologist Alex West (Daniel Craig) and cyber-geek creator Bryce (Noah Taylor). As the first interplanetary alignment in 5000 years approaches, Lara Croft faces her greatest challenge. The final duel amongst the starring and contenders for the possession of the ancient relics is impressive and groundbreaking."
3273,"And there's the wonderful little boy who spends the whole movie getting accidentally brutalized, hit by cars and running into airplane propellers, always with much blood and flying viscera. Although it has some geniuinely funny scenes (especially the ones featuring Rip Torn) many scenes exist purely for their shock value. Other "" gross - out "" comedies present their vulgarities with the sober convention, creating a pornographic aura that is shameful instead of funny."
3766,"At the time of the movie America was a dark and mysterious place, home to all of the fears of Europeans. ' Le Pacte des Loups' has one of the strongest French language casts possible, a mix of veterans and some up and coming talent. A strong female role is unusual in movies, but two? In complete contrast there is the innocent, fragile, and astonishingly beautiful, Madeiline (Emilie Dequenne), younger sister to the protective Jean Francois. Horror movies live or die by the creature and fortunately this movie delivers."
3768,"But that stunning ending changed everything and called into question all that came before it. and decides to set all his watches (he sells them on the street) to Paris time, and then all the clocks in his house, and then all the clocks he can find. The film moves slow and it has little dialogue, as is Tsai's style, but it is incredibly beautiful in its composition, editing, everything. The film builds up to a silent crescendo, where the three main characters each endure cold acts of love and failed attempts at communication. Michelangelo Antonioni, who is obviously Tsai's main inspiration (though this particular film has a lot of references to the Truffaut film The 400 Blows, including a very funny cameo by Jean - Pierre Leaud), had a problem moving on from this material, as well, with everything from L'Avventura to Red Desert being very similar (although his style evolved more than Tsai's has), and even after that his films had comparable themes."
3978,"Ditto for the other actors, for this is a great ensemble cast, even though most of the performers never appear in any scenes together. McConaughey, Duvall, Turturro and Irving are all outstanding in this film, but it is Arkin who soars in the key role of the disgruntled businessman. In short, everything in the film was just as it should be--fitting its own story perfectly, representing its thoughts, its characters, its themes with seemingly effortless grace and poetry. Like ` Go' a few years back, the makers of this film respect the intelligence of their audience. Just as everything seems to be going your way, an unexpected and unforeseen ` event' may knock you completely off course, thereby depriving you of that ` happiness' you felt, moments before, lay just within your grasp."
3777,"Of all the movies based on Philip K Dick stories, this one actually is most true to the plot line. Sinise is excellent, Stowe is pretty and sensual as usual and D'Onofrio is over the top, as usual. It's more faithful to the PKD story and captures the theme of identity and illusion vs reality more concisely. The short makes Olham a little more contradictory - he tells his wife that his project is a good thing, then he questions what he's doing with his friend at the Project. The special effects were 1st rate, locations, cinematography, acting, all very, very good."
3272,"It is also obviously that now it is much harder to surprise or entertain anyone with wild Aussies. So if you like the first two Crocodile Dundee movies most likely you will enjoy this little movie or at least you'll tolerate it. The sequel (Dundee II) was very good and that should have been the end of it. Paul Hogan's knive - tossing, hand - slapping Outback legend skipped the whole of the 90's so his 2001 comeback came as something of a big surprise. Despite that this sequel had enough funny moments and jokes, including one very surprising cameo appearance."
6586,"The scenes are very well built and the director truly owns this movie. Selton Mello plays AndrÃ© a son who seeks to control his inner passions with the stagnant philosophy of his father. Although in some moments the words just repeat what images show completely (no reason for that), it is amazing how a psychological book such as Raduan Nassar's novel has become a mature film. "" Lavoura Arcaica "" (aka "" To The Left of the Father "") is one of the most intense films you'll ever see - love it or hate it, it'll be a real experience for you. Devastating could be the best word to describe this masterpiece, based upon Raduan Nassar's brief, but strong novel of the same name."
3595,"The film communicates a powerful message that no teenager is incapable of taking their jealousy to extremes, and O's superb cast of young actors effectively demonstrate how treachery and envy can lead to tragedy. Quite correctly, the film is aimed at a teenage audience, with a smorgasboard of hot young talent. Mehki Phifer, portrays Odin, the star basketball player who has everything going for him, until his' friend' Hugo (Josh Hartnett) is overcome with his emotions and envy for Odin that he devotes his time and effort to destroying his life, which he ultimately succeeds in doing. Phifer is remarkable in his role, but Hartnett steals the show in a performance that he's never outdone. Julia Stiles also performs well as Desi Brable, the sweet, smart and pretty girlfriend of Odin."
3836,"Then things start going right, Vinnie looks a lot more comfortable and the movie starts to get going and goes from strength to strength with loads of gags and some occasional violence to break things up a bit. The match is what the watchers of this film want to see and it is fantastically constructed, just one tip of advice, don't p *** of the' Monk' 10/10 stars, classic stuff Like the original (The Longest Yard), it was made to entertain the audience, not to provoke some deep introspective thought on the existence of God. Of course, there's very few movies with Burt Reynolds that are worth more than a glance ("" Deliverance "" being a huge exception). Jones is good, but Statham steals the show in almost all of his scenes."
3594,"Especially good is Salva's patience in developing his sibling protagonists, their dialogue and reading good enough to establish what most genre work can't even dream of--plausible characters. The creature itself is also a good presence even if it does lose a little bit of its creepiness when the wings come out. Definitely Salva's finest work up - to - date, leaving his poor debut feature "" Powder "" far behind. With two good lead actors and their silly clichÃ©s that are guilty pleasures, this was a fun road trip movie with the great creeps. Salva directs well and injects a good sense of tension into the film but he also knows how to frame a shot â€“ his use of darkness and the tunnel spotlight effect both being pretty effective."
3583,"He was the only good reason to watch Seinfeld. Jon Lovitz was excellent in this film, along with Mr. Bean (or Rowan Atkinson as he is called by non-Mr. An eccentric squillionaire has put it in a locker without explanation. He wants to keep his wealthy, high stakes gamblers interested in his gambling techniques so he arranges a new, quasi-legal sporting event for them to bet on: a human rat race. The movie succeeds without clever jokes, with its hilarious scenes to make fun of the greedy or the "" don't know how to spend their money "" people."
3347,"It is a really good character portrait that also has some really fired up performances from Ving Rhames, as a new ex-con boyfriend of his mother, A. J. Johnson as the mother, Omar Gooding (Gooding Jr.'s brother) as Jody's good friend, especially Taraji P. Henson in one of the best female performances of the year as Jody's girlfriend and also mother of one of his children, and of course, Snoop Dogg as a version of himself (albiet evil). (Especially one monologue by Mr Rhames--phenomenal, Sir!) Ving Rhames as Melvin: Stupid and psychotic former criminal that brags about his past misdeeds as if that was cool. The film stars in a debut of Tyrese Gibson (some may remember Cuba Gooding got his first speaking role with Boyz) as Jody, a boy (age 20) who still lives with his mother, is the father of 2 children from 2 different mothers, has no real job and often just hangs about complaining and being spoiled. Melvin showed that the street mentality never leaves a street thug, but he can learn to make better and more positive choices."
3989,"It is a beautiful story based on an Inuit legend that exists on many different levels and subplots, etc. . You will be a bit confused at first, trying to understand the characters and what exactly is happening, but then it starts to really suck you in, you begin to love the protagonists, who are physically beautiful people, and then you will grow to hate the antagonists, who are mean and undesirable. The use of Inuktitut, which is still a living language, preserves that essential atmosphere of complete authenticity; the building of igloos, the darkness inside the communal dwelling with only seal oil lamps, the use of bone and driftwood and dried seaweed for tools and fuel are absolutely authentic. Unbelievable scenes with wonderful photography and chilling (no pun intended) moments."
3348,"It is really far better than most teen movies. Kind of like a Charlie Sheen movie, back when he was having all those ego problems. Finally --- the DVD is also great. Even though nothing in the story of course happens as a real surprise, the movie still knows how to create a believable and touching story about love with more than enough original touches in it. It's a perfectly watchable movie mainly targeted towards teens, however also different age groups should be able to appreciate this movie and its love story."
3641,"The plot is basically just a way to get all of the sports in and the funny scenes are put in along the way. It has some very funny scenes (playing spoons) and some great shots of extreme sports. It has moments of supreme slapstick humor as well as hilarious dialog. If you're looking for a great movie with a Christian - ish theme to it, go and see Saved! This is a good clean movie you can watch with anyone including but not limited too, pastors, parents, nuns, old people, ninjas, and the FBI."
3394,"Excellent acting is the attraction in this low - key heist movie, which only gets into high gear in the last 30 minutes of the two hours, and features some nice twists. Brando delivers about 5 scenes that are right on key and provides some comic relief that fits nicely. What makes it worth watching over many other similar twisty heist movies is the cast, who manage to make the material seem better by their inclusion. Overall a really good film that will leave audiences with their jaws on the floor. The trio of brilliant lead actors transcend the plot, and overcome the sometimes sluggish direction (courtesy of Frank Oz, who did Bowfinger and many other comedies--and children's flicks, such as The Indian in the Cupboard)."
3793,"The use of sound is most effective as well, with all sorts of bizarre noises being heard, including the odd screeching noise that the Mothman was said to have made in some of the real accounts. Just listening to the soundtrack is guaranteed to give you chills. It also has interesting characters and some emotional moments. The Mothman Prophecies is a solid thriller. Will Patton is outstanding as a local resident who has several run - ins with the Mothman until it drives him crazy."
4095,"Fun, lovable, and humorous, she almost manages to save this film, despite a few shaky scenes. The main character named Sam is a mormon version of Ned Flanders (from the Simpsons), he meets Charlie. The movie makes you think about your own beliefs and the important things in life."
5893,"The cast was inspiring and a fun look at where some of them were just 4 years ago and how far they have come. A must see for anyone between the ages of 20 - 40. It has so many truths and is hilarious. If you liked this, and you should for what it was (Ebert could lighten up but then again he probably can't be PC and give this movie anything more than zero stars), check out Tomcats - similarly funny and original. Has some great characters kind of like Tomcats."
4596,"Cabin Fever is about 5 college kids who had just finish test finals and are enjoying some relaxation and fun in a cabin in the woods but the fun is cut short when they learn a flesh eating bacteria disease is around. The movie stars Rider Strong (from Boy Meets World), Jordan Ladd (Broken Lizard Club Dread), Cierina Vincent (whose "" spolier "" featured in two steamy sex scenes one of which is good and another is okay at first then it gets weird."
4599,"Adrien Brody is quietly wonderful as an unemployed nebbish in his late twenties who stills lives with his parents and has a fascination with ventriloquism; he finally buys a dummy of his own and practices the craft he's dreamed about, yet also realizes (via his new wooden companion) that it may be time to start growing up. Greg Pritikin wrote and directed this low - budget satire of suburban craziness, and seems to harbor an affection for bughouse characters all living on the edge. It isn't an original vision (Hal Hartley was mining this dryly eccentric territory 10 years ago), but it's still surprising how successfully Pritikin manages to pull this intentionally bumpy story together. Illeana Douglas and Vera Farmiga are also very fine, and though the construction of the script is caricature - oriented, most of these actors overcome the slight material, revealing something unexpected in the process: a sunny story about weirdos that ultimately celebrates humanity. Steve, fired from his job, meets employment counselor Lorena (Vera Farmiga) and sparks of all kind begin to fly."
3803,"Dave (Devon Sawa), Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael C. Maronna) are the best cheaters on campus cheating their way though college with elaborate scams and cons that probably take more planning and energy than it would take to actually study hard. This movie was trying to fit itself into the' gross - out' comedies of recent years such as American Pie and Road Trip, but it just failed miserably. With his friends help, Dave finds the courage to finally confront Angela and tell her the truth as well as how much he loves her and how he found his true self by loving her blah, blah, blah. Scenes that should have been fun turned out to be off - putting & incredibly juvenile. Some gags are very funny such as Ethan's fantasy making out with 2 girls at once and a sequence portraying the friendship of the "" slackers ""."
4620,"As crazy and silly as this setup sounds, the film actually achieves depths that most "" serious "" movies can't even begin to touch. Lansdale routinely puts different genres in a blender together and comes out with something better than a genre outing. The gist of the story is that Elvis (Bruce Campbell) didn't die (it was an impersonator he swapped places with who popped his clogs), and is spending the rest of his days in a Texas rest home, with a busted hip and a growth on the end of his pecker, and he's none to happy. Coscarelli and cinematographer Adam Janeiro easily capture a nice dreamlike atmosphere in the retirement home and grounds, with the fantastic hallways especially standing out. (Which is a tribute to Coscarelli, as most mainstream Hollywood movies would have mangled the source material into something unrecognizable from what it once was.)"
4621,"Admittedly, DEMONLOVER makes a sharp left narrative turn at the halfway point that's going to confound viewers who are intrigued by the straightforward (and extremely absorbing) high - stakes opening. Every line of dialogue is about the business merger at hand; in the rare instances where feelings are discussed, they're usually about how * work * affects those emotions. Considering the labyrinthine motives of her character, Nielsen's exquisite subtlety may be lost on first - time viewers; on second look, her emotionless gaze speaks volumes. Demonlover is in many ways an interesting movie. Same industrial' cool' spaces, same underacted performances (Nielsen is brilliant) and all in all a plot that goes off track near the end."
4622,"Eclectic English film - maker Michael Winterbottom has produced his finest work to date with' In this World', a pseudo-documentary account of the attempted journey of two Afghani refugees to London. This film's outstanding achievement is the sense it conveys that despite the ubiquity of television, mobile phones and the English language, this is still a big, poor and very beautiful world. From the outset, it is pointed out that lots more' muhla' went into bombing Afghanistan than providing refugees with any assistance. It is certainly more vivid an disturbing than most road movies, whether you are talking about "" Stagecoach "" or even "" Thelma and Louise "" - this is gripping stuff indeed, and a good companion to the recent Afghan film "" Osama . "" Motivated by a news story about 58 Chinese immigrants found suffocated in a container at Dover, In This World by Michael Winterbottom is a passionate tribute to the nearly one million refugees a year who are willing to take enormous risks to seek a better life."
4623,"a good story, good characters, good acting (not stars hamming it and ISO of an Oscar - gag), good cinematography, a good script with good dialogue and good direction. Hook up with someone in Europe and make a great movie there. The two actresses and their male colleagues are all young (except the Colonel character, a big beefy macho guy) and very impressive. The themes of deep care and concern for others (friendship in SBM, erotic love in Y&J) and the deepening and transforming of that care in light of being witness to a death are shared by both films. Yossi is Jagger's boss and both are the stars in their base for in their very own way both young men are special."
4630,"Wonderful as he is as a teacher â€“ and surely his patient firmness makes him superb with children in a peculiarly French way--the insistence on manners and civility, on his being called ` monsieur' (a bit old fashioned, one might think, even pre-1968, pre-Seventies) â€“ and that apparent absence of a life outside the classroom, all suggest a certain human limitation in Georges Lopez. Lopez is always focusing on him, but without great effect: he eludes molding too. You realize he's just a boy â€“ full of possibilities. Throughout ÃŠtre et avoir there are moments that are tremendously moving, which pop up instantly without warning. There are beautiful brief sequences of the snow, of cows, of one of the boys cooking and driving a tractor."
7508,"Pixar's short animations tend to be either original meaningful films or continuations of existing intellectual property. Yeah, multiply that by 72 and that's how many gadgets this car has. Crystal voices Mike to perfection whilst Goodman unfortunately does not have too much to say. His dialogue consists of murmurs and sounds of pondering, highlighting Sully's perplexed bewilderment. This short film is written and directed by Pixar big name Pete Docter and he got help from Roger Gould and a couple writers who also worked on the first Monsters movie."
7400,"Kevin is still 9 more than 10 years later. The first 2 (and a bit of the 3rd) movies also benefited from a very strong musical score that elevated them far beyond a typical family comedy. well, apart from a lingering insult to the first two Home Alone movies. Everything from the script, the acting to the sets, seemingly knocked - up from left - overs at the nearest Reject shop, smack of Z - grade involvement."
6044,"Whereas "" y tu mamÃ¡ tambiÃ©n "" is a master piece and well acted, directed, edited and told, this movie falls short of its intentions in building a coherent drama. The real star here is Yusa, the crazy guy. Menolippu Mombasaan is good movie no doubt about it! The idea of a road movie in beautifully shot summerly Findand is quite tempting, and the elements of the' last hot summer before the adulthood' are all there. This movie which has also had some success at festivals around the world is evidence that Finland can produce international quality movies."
3809,"` Big Fat Liar' offers a lively contemporary spin on the Boy Who Cried Wolf legend. One day, through an amazing fluke, he meets up with a nefarious movie producer named Marty Wolf who steals Shepherd's story idea â€“ a composition he wrote for his English class entitled ` Big Fat Liar' â€“ and proceeds to make a movie out of it. Kids will love ` Big Fat Liar' for the simple reason that it works as pure adolescent fantasy wish - fulfillment on several levels. First, it shows a youngster getting the rare opportunity of turning a major studio backlot into his own personal playground (the film sometimes feels like a 90 - minute commercial for Universal Studios' behind - the - scenes tour). In fact, the best parts of the film occur near the beginning when Jason and his adventures stay connected to the real world."
3810,""" Collateral Damage "" touches on the subject briefly - enough to humanize the terrorist leader, even! If that is not the most unbelievable plot you can imagine, then there are some twists and turns that are even more incredible. There are twists and turns in the plot, and the first half is full of time - filling minutes spent getting to know yet - another - comedic sidekick, who will disappear entirely from the movie within minutes (couldn't they have stuck with one sidekick?"
3811,"John McTiernan, director of such classics as' The Predator' and' Die Hard' has managed to make a movie, that is in one word, poor. In the self - centered and hedonistic 70's, isn't it amazing the true gist of the original film is the attempt to keep a famous player from becoming bigger than the game he plays?"
3821,"As a singer she is as good as most of the rest of the young singers who cater to the teeniebopper audience. Compared to good young actresses, Britney is fairly amateurish. Most of the situations and dialog are silly, and there are many close - range shots of a pretty, smiling Britney. You're much better off using that money to see a better film currently in theatres. Cliched and uninspiring plot, acting that needs to be reported to the trades description act, and Britney Spears."
3822,"If one were to place too great an emphasis on many of the smug and self - serving views expressed by various contributors here, it may well appear somewhat of an enigma that HART'S WAR still rates 6. A screen adaptation of John Katzenbach's excellent novel, this late WW2 flick tackles racism, POW life and honor. A lot of what is uttered during the "" court - room "" sequences has great relevance in all facets of life - IF you care to listen. Viewers who like Willis will not be disappointed and Colin Farrell is sure to delight the ladies with his Irish good looks, dark "" little boy "" eyes and expressions."
4701,"It's moments of levity are welcome, but few. Ruane has a simpler role but works OK it in, likewise Fulton, Abercromby and others all turn in natural performances. Credit to Loach again because he has drawn out convincing performances despite working with a mostly young cast. (B +) Note - This film does have English subtitles making it more user friendly for those who find the thick Scot dialect difficult to understand. First - time actor Martin Compston, a professional soccer player from the Greenrock area picked by Loach from a high school audition, holds the film together with a truly convincing performance as the good - natured teenager who has excellent motives but lacks the ability to realize them in socially acceptable ways."
4702,"It is full of surprises and features an excellent Gary Oldman and an hilarious Chris Cooper. An intelligent, offbeat road movie with fantasy elements is a hard thing to sell, so they don't bother and the film eventually limps its way onto DVD. James Marsden, Gary Oldman, Christopher Lloyd, and Amy Smart all turn in stellar performances. This film is one of the few modern movies, that really HAS something to say. In a time when films like "" Gigli "" are invading the film market, this is a breath of fresh air, a step towards a better side of film - making, a side with morals for today's youth and future generations."
4704,"Snappy editing and a well - timed score heighten the horrors that pack nanchuka punches to the guts. If you like horror movies and want to experiment, this is a good chance, and one of the best in the genre since the little shown Audition earlier this year. Her doctor, Dr. Lo (a really young looking Edmund Chen) doesn't believe her at first, but then realizes that there may be some merit to her claims, so they go in search of the donor in order to find out what history her eyes' previous owner had, and what kind of baggage Wong Kar Mun has to deal with now. The rest of the film is certifiably creepy, but there is actually a decent story to support those creepy parts. The Eye tells a good story and tells it well, with strong characters and genuine scares."
3823,"Friends Laura Herring and David Thornton (and seemingly countless other ordinary people) do their best to help the couple raise money and soon it seems that most everything they have is on the market to be sold. Washington, arguably better here than in recent triumphs like "" Training Day "" (an Oscar - winning role) and "" Antwone Fisher "", goes to an even higher plateau here. Strikingly accurate when pointing the finger at things wrong with America these days, "" John Q "" is a thought - provoking production that will cause its audience to think and learn about sometimes forgotten aspects of human life. Anne Heche's performance as Rebecca Payne, the hospital administrator, is quite sickening because she plays the bureaucracy part of the role but she does it well. James Woods plays the rich, blood - sucking doctor who John Q. takes hostage along with other innocent bystanders and hospital staff but John Q. has a heart too."
7170,"Limos and Grant are both pretty good looking but they cannot deliver a convincing line or even a convincing slap for all the tea in China. Clark's direction is interesting at least; at points the cinematography is nicely washed out, blending colours into frames to depict changes in emotion and several other nice touches â€“ if only he had been able to draw out value from the material â€“ the odd nice visual touch is not enough. this film demonstrates good photographic and special effects skills, but the visuals are not accompanied by anything too satisfying. Mr. Jasso is the film's "" Best Supporting Actor "" and Ms. Limos is the "" Sexiest Supporting Actress "". The concept itself is interesting - Clark, fond of examining the behaviour of teenagers without the rule of law, has attempted to create a society that forms an ideal background to test the behaviour of a number of teenagers who live in a society where there is literally are no laws."
4712,"The film is carried by the lead actress who is always the star despite some good supporting performances. on the cusp of what, from the outside, seems like success in both of these realms, esther (the central character) badly injures her leg but doesn't even notice for several hours. END OF SPOILERS But look what you can into this film, well after all it's a French film, and if it isn't experimental, pushing - edge and thought - provoking, it isn't French enough right? Her cutting affects other relationships in her life--a female colleague at her work with whom she maintains a chilly friendship fraught with bitterness and rivalry and her boss, who she embarrasses in front of business associates at dinner with another incident (the dinner scene was one of the best scenes in the film). It's sometimes a case of being tricked into believing that you've seen more than you really have but there are also moments that genuinely induce cringing--nails digging into wood comes to mind--and the camera never shies away."
3824,"It had better songs, more exciting action, better voice acting, and funnier lost boys. "" Peter Pan In Return To Never Land "" is Disney â€˜s animated sequel to their truly classic 1953 adaptation of J. M. Barrie â€˜s beloved children â€˜s story. Time â€˜s moved on since the first movie and although Peter Pan never grew up, Wendy did. However when Hook flies his sailing ship to London, kidnaps Jane and takes her to Never Land, she soon wishes she has paid more attention to her mother â€˜s stories. The use of computer generated animation does successfully enhance certain scenes, sometimes so subtly you do nâ€˜t even notice, and sometimes â€“ in the case of Tinkerbell â€˜s magical pixie dust â€“ to spectacular effect."
5880,"The deviations this work takes from the original movie are constructive variations rather than the mindless drivel customary in the King remakes. It's one of the best horror movies of the 20th century. TV movies tend to be endlessly drawn out, with low proudction values, and this was better than average. Rena Sofer as Miss Desjarden was a delight to behold. Even though it was modernized with Carrie making references to the internet, Chris using a cell phone, etc. ."
6965,"Daria had an admirable sense of self that could not be rattled by the conventions of others. This movie wraps up the Daria series and deals with the outcome of the college plans of Daria, her boyfriend Tom, best friend Jane, and classmates Jodie and Mack. Daria gets confirmation of what she already knows - that connections and personality trump brains - when distinguished college Bromwell passes her over for admittance, but accepts her old - moneyed and more conventionally likable boyfriend, Tom. Hard core Daria fans will love the animated cells at the final credits."
4725,"To a large extent, the inherent friction between America's central majority and diverse religious minority groups is controlled and channeled by a matrix of Constitutional Law principles. Living in large communities side by side with the "" english "", as they call without distinction all others, their energy, excellent and desired produce and products and reputation for orderly, crime - free lives has insured respect. Anyone interested in learning about Amish teenagers should watch this film. It is surprising how many similarities and differences there are between Amish teenagers, and the average American teenagers. You can't help but cringe with fear as Faron drops in and out of the drug culture, nearly gets himself killed in a car accident, and eventually finds love and a decent job many miles away from his parents."
4813,"It provides an origin only; the painting is about all the magical things that happen in the space between the subject and the viewers eye. With lots of bamboo screens, all these are used to show the space, plus the usual fantastic mountains, clouds and forests - even at the end the Great Wall and of course the moving waves of soldiers and courtiers. Nameless weaves his heroic though modest story of how he killed the assassins, but the King remains unconvinced, spinning his own version of how he believed events unfolded. The sheer beauty of the battles, the gentle floating of the assassins as they fly around their arenas (which range from a forest full of orange leafed trees, crisp leaves falling down to the ground like rain, to the crystal clear and calm of a mountain lake), the costumes of characters at varying stages in the story line (red for passion, green for youth, white for truth, blue for love), the amazing army scenes which feature thousands of arrows being fired into the sky to create a black cloud that descends right on top of the camera, all these elements combine to produce a faultlessly perfect image on the screen, each frame a worthy photograph that gently reminds you why cinema is the greatest art form of the twentieth century. It's reminiscent of Akira Kurosawa's RASHOMON, and is a great way of developing a mystery thriller."
4837,"One of the best scenes in the film is when the family are at the fairground, one of the girls asks for an ET teddy which can be won on one of the stalls. This scene is gripping as the father tries to win the ET teddy for his youngest daughter, you can see the pain going through the fathers face as he tries to prove himself to his daughter as the dollars are rushing away from him. The connection between the father and eldest daughter during the final scene was excellently heartwarming, it showed everything the film was all about in one powerful scene. Their lives change and Johnny and Sarah learn to face and heal their wounds with the arrival of the baby and the friendship of Mateo. The two sisters playing the daughters are amazing."
3834,"This is a good one to see if you aren't into horror movies and want something that stirs the little grey cells. The thing that drives the fictional Emily in the fictional tale is more compelling than anything else. Even more strange, in some scenes it actually succeeds in that. Although using many clichÃ©s, the plot is romantic and the story is beautiful. At times where his wife is communicating with Joe, at least to Joe's knowledge, the film breaths a creepy atmosphere with a cinematography and score that make things suspenseful."
6418,"Kirk R. Thatcher) Kermit is enjoying their Christmas with their usual selection of shows at the Muppet Theatres, but then trouble starts. The acting as always was good, with some wonderful cameos, such as Matthew Lillard, who was just funny. The downside of this is that the plot is very episodic, but the plus side is that the film is funny and will easily engage adults as well as children. The cast of muppets are very good - with all the new characters from the television show having a bit of time, including Pepe, Risso the Rat, Johnny Fiama and his monkey etc. . The cast of Scrubs are wasted and not funny apart from showing up but cameos from Arquette, Macy, Goldberg and Lillard are all amusing and Cusack seems to enjoy herself."
3835,"Combining The Vampire Lestat and the Queen of the Damned novels into one screenplay was, ahem, damned to suffer massive story cuts because of the intricate and detailed background of a dozen or so characters involved. Embrace its plot holes and stupid dialog (which lends itself to random quoting), sing along to the entertaining rock songs. In some scenes, this works adequately, but on the whole, Jessie's motivations, while they are explained, seem kind of empty. That said, the question remains, without the detail and extra characters, can the basic story of Lestat's re-awakening of the Queen of all vampires be entertaining and sufficient enough to sustain itself? Marius (who did not make Lestat btw) in the chronicles is the great reasoner of the Vampires."
4857,"In most country cousin / city cousin tales, the contrast between rural and urban life styles is portrayed in a humorous fashion. He has divorced a woman he clearly still loves, and has no satisfying human relationships. Uzak was shown as part of the Rochester Labor Film series. The motif of ailing mothers is one of the crucial ties between the cousins, for Yusuf has one too. Like a symphony, the film plays around with the various meanings of its title in a virtuoso directorial performance by NB Ceylan, who has made a career out of enshrining Tarkovsky into the landscape of Turkish cinema."
6494,"What comes out of that mouth is some of the funniest and most irreverent talk one has heard in presentations such as these. It was totally free, and he talked for five hours, just like IMDb says he did at Cornell. Shooting from the hip with the same sort of brash bluntness of his characters, Kevin fields questions and reveals truths about the movies you love. A compilation of college lectures given by cult - favorite filmmaker Kevin Smith, it ranges in topics from religion to homosexuality, to Kevin's films to the cadre of odd young men who want to give him oral sex. Whether it's how he knew Jay was funny or how he met Prince, they are all gems."
4933,""" Broken Wings "" is a poignant, slice - of - life drama about an Israeli family's coming to terms with the death of their father nine months earlier. As a second crisis hits the family, a whole host of long - dormant feelings and emotions finally break out in open conflict. Orly Silbersatz Banai as Dafna, Maya Maron as Maya, and Nitai Gaviratz as Yair deliver, beautifully realistic, heartfelt performances. "" Broken Wings "" is a small, overlooked gem that gets to the heart of what it means to be a family. Nice film overall with good acting performances"
4934,"The three principals (henderson, sives and rawlings) are so utterly convincing and there is so much chemistry between them all. They are backed up by two brilliant turns from Julia Davis as Moira and Mads Mikkelsen as Horst. He's a friendly, charming and responsible man, who's flirting with one of two regular costumers, a girl name Alice. From good cinematografy and a good script, to a well polished, melancholic score, this film is worth viewing. [WARNING: Some spoilers ahead] Suicide is a serious subject and any attempt at showing it in a humorous light runs the risk of trivializing what amounts to a major public health problem."
4938,"In the end, when all of the actresses involved in the documentary are signing their names in lipstick on pieces of mirror (huh?) But others provide nuggets of wisdom like Holly Hunter, Diane Lane, Salma Hayek, Martha Plimpton (who has forsaken movies for the stage) and a predictably funny Whoopi Goldberg. Arquette's earthy style made the documentary flow very smoothly, and it was refreshing to see no pretensions. Arquette gamely drops a lot of the pretensions of the industry to tell her story, and to get the other actresses to tell theirs, and as a result manages to reveal unexpected truths about the people behind the profession. What was most impressive about the documentary was the incredible number of actresses interviewed."
5715,"These cross-references, which can also slightly break the linear timeline, are effective if one is alert. The first 40 - something minutes are closest to the American remake, but it was surprising that this film is much more linear. Many of the films most frightening sequences feature the murdered woman Kayako: her head full of black hair peeking around a corner, her shadow moving down a corridor and filling a security camera, a head - on shot of her crawling through an attic at night with only the beam of a flashlight illuminating her. Butchered mother - ghost Kayako is very Sadako - like, crawling around with her long black hair in her face and moving with unearthly jerkiness. There were a couple very minor flaws--occasionally awkward performances or editing being the primary one, but overall this is highly recommended."
5712,"And an utterly bizarre tale this is, with enough laughs, emotion and poignant moments anyone could want. Hiroyuki Morita's THE CAT RETURNS is a delightfully engaging children's fantasy from Japanese animation powerhouse' Studio Ghibli', creators of SPIRITED AWAY. Resurrecting' The Baron', an aristocratic feline from previous Ghibli release Whispers Of The Heart, this has schoolgirl Haru being, well Just don't go expecting a film on the same level as Spirited Away or Mononoke and you'll have a great time. Having said that, this cynical thirty - something loved it to bits."
5695,"This is a stunning piece of work which wipes the floor with contemporary Hollywood's so - called "" thrillers "". It's a very grim and depressing movie, full of violence, but also includes some great performances, some beautiful sequences, and characters you genuinely empathize with. Sadly very few people are going to see this brilliant movie, and the few who get to hear about it will be told about the more extreme and brutal scenes and will probably think it's just about shock for shocks sake. The violence is very graphic, but as much as Mr. Park show's, it's what he doesn't show that makes him so talented, the subtle use of sound to advance the film is outright brilliance. Park Chan - wook directs with such beautifully composed images that are far from the the garish MTV - style action / thriller movies produced in Hollywood these days."
5694,"FUBAR (an obscene acronym from the military) is an amazing accomplishment. The classic success story of guys who maxed out their credit cards (including their Canadian Tire cards) and took a giant leap into the uncertain future - and it paid off. They did a good job promoting the movie through a soundtrack featuring Sum 41, Gob, Sloan, etc. doing classic Canadian headbangin' tunes. There is a deep honesty in the performances and throughout the film. The great flick here is Fubar."
5691,"This is a downer and makes the middle seem like it takes forever, and coupled with the weak, confusing story and lack of inventive traps, really brings this down. Everything - absolutely everything - in this movie is designed to be "" Bigger, Better, Faster ""! And there are some funny moments in this one. (brilliant opening credits though) But Hypercube - although not as good as Cube - does work as' next step' sort of sequel. The "" Cubes "" in this one are basically very bright white and it is sometimes very intrusive to the eyes."
5690,"It is very funny - Its probably not as funny as the TV show or the video as thats where Ali G's stupidity is in its element. While it wont go down as a great British movie, it definitely is one of the better ones and funnier than some more high profile movies, it is still very funny and childish. The humour is probably very English, and specifically London, so its possible that non-English viewers may not get some of the humour. STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs Movie adaptations of TV shows, books or magazines are rarely very good, but Ali G Indahouse is one of those pleasing exceptions to the rule. You can watch it several times and pick new gags up each time."
5425,"Thus the project is launched and Callas is revitalized and happy again, being satisfied with the miracle of technology that allows her to invest her energies in the acting of Carmen while consenting to lip - synch to her old recordings. Fanny Ardant is a miracle as Callas: she inhabits her physically, understands Callas' facial features as she lip - synchs her operas, and seems to be a reincarnation of the Diva. Jeremy Irons gives one of the finest performances of his rich career as the aging gay agent and Joan Plowright adds just the right amount of lightness and grace as Sarah Keller - wise, acerbic, yet supportive of both Callas and Kelley. The scenes of Paris are correctly nostalgic: the sets for' Carmen' by Carlo Centolavigna create a gold standard for all future true productions of' Carmen'. The passages of the many arias used in this film are among the finest versions Callas recorded."
5339,"This certainly won't be to everyone's tastes, but it's a good one. The acting is tremendous, the dialogue is delivered with such ease and intensity, and where there is caddiness--it is intentional. Better performances, and directing, would be difficult to see. Excellent performances and production design that never overshadows the rest of the show, despite being constantly inventive and energetic."
5325,"Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Florida Secretary of State Harris planned for months before the election to purge the voter rolls of legally registered Democrats. It also shows how the Democrats damaged their campaign by going for selective recounts rather than a properly democratic complete hand recount. Unprecedented â€“ the 2000 presidential elections is a movie all real Americans must watch. Improper, almost criminal, activities of the supreme court, Katherine Harris and her entire office, Jeb Bush and his entire office, dozens of congressmen and senators, scores of aides. To keep the U. S. a democracy, with fair elections, you must see this and show it to friends."
4975,"There are moments in this film written so smartly you appreciate Agresti's talent. He is articulate, wise and knows a lot about the life of the astronauts he hears about. For instance, Valentin's scenes with Leticia are funny because of the way the two actors play the scenes so naturally, their dialogue and actions make perfect sense. Carmen Maura is fantastic as usual, and the unknown Julieta Cardinali has a very beautiful participation. Julieta Cardinali is seen briefly as Leticia, a beautiful blonde woman who Valentin would like to be his new mother, hoping his father will marry her."
5189,"Whether you are a hardcore Kitano fan or just enjoy films, watch it, you won't get disappointed. For the best, one would still have to go back to the likes of David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia. Anyone who truly loves film should see Dolls. A frequently applied angle in looking at Dolls is its beautiful cinematography, simply in terms of Kitano's desire to show the natural beauty of Japan in the four seasons. Dolls is interesting, worth a look and still better than 99% of films out there."
5041,"Not like all other school shooting movies like "" Elephant "" or "" Zero day "" this one has a deeper meaning. This wonderful film honestly explores the factors that lead teenagers to become violent. It does an excellent job of tacking the touch issues of adolescence, guns in schools, and school administrators being completely oblivious to what is really going on in their hallways. But if high school is a trap for kids, it's a source of income for teachers and administrators, some of whom thus have selfish motives for preserving the status quo. It is also a genuine drama, and takes no prisoners when it comes to depicting adult hypocrisy and aloofness."
5059,"When The Matrix appeared in 1999 and questioned existence and identity, it was expected that a lot of movies would use it as inspiration. The story is of a Morgan Sullivan, who applies for a job with a high - flying techno - company called Digicorp. Digicorp are using these people as puppets and creating personalities and lives for these people while wiping their own existence."
5109,"Though Larry's Clark's movies deal with very explicit, or "" realistic "" subject matter his presentation is overwrought. As one who is purported to be a breaker of styles and conventions this movie was shot pretty conventionally with lots of sex. Depending on who you ask, the scenes in question are "" brutally honest "" or simply "" disgustingly pornographic "". Tate's grandparents may initially come across as whiny and pathetic yet there's a sweet little scene later on that shows their genuine affection for one another. The scenes are tense, the technical side perfect."
5112,"On one hand, everything goes as long as people get what they want for 2 hours worth. It has an all star cast in Hong Kong cinema, and of course, the screenplay, the acting, the editing, the camera work and overall directing is flawless judging by all standards. - Infernal Affairs: 9/10 A brilliant cop movie out of Hong Kong, with a sublime plot and great acting by the two leads Andy Lau and Tony Leung (an indescribably great actor). Great stuff, and the DVD even has the alternative ending (which isn't nearly as good as the main one). This a splicing of everything Asians do best in a moody, stylish tension - based thriller."
5124,"The Weather Underground presents a well - balanced view of the militant faction of the 1960s anti-war group that orchestrated a series of direct actions (including bombings) in protest of the Vietnam War and American imperialism. Perhaps if viewed in tandem with a film that explores the victories that have been made through non-violent protest "" The Weather Underground "" can achieve its best potential. Nicely made documentary about some self - proclaimed "" revolutionaries "" from the 60's & 70's who, after discovering that breaking windows alone wouldn't overthrow the U. S. government, decide to up the ante by bombing any government building they feel is connected to atrocities committed worldwide. This is a documentary about a group of activists who made a true sacrifice, giving up their own freedom to try and stop a war."
5129,"An unusual item keeps appearing, despite attempts to discard it. Despite Dark Water's relatively overt similarities to a number of other filmic works, this is one of director Hideo Nakata's most successful films--at least as good as his famed Ringu (1998), if not better. Girls may be the focus because of irony--they're supposed to be cute (as is Kanno, who turns in a great performance along with her more adult fellow cast) and innocent. Another important symbolic commonality shared by both Ringu and Dark Water is that of claustrophobic spaces. Nakata's well known deliberate pacing is perfect here."
5136,"He revealed that this movie was created in a unique fashion: almost all of the acting was improvised, and only very few scenes were scripted, and that was only done for consistency. In fact, the real dentist's nurse refused to be on camera, and Dresen had to get someone (from his small crew) to stand in for the position in the shot, but the actual operation and tooth removal is all REAL, live footage. A dramaturg worked to ensure narrative consistency, and the small film team met to plan the scenes for the next day. By the way - the film often is compared to Dogme95, with good reason. While the plot management could have been better, though it does entertain, one of the major problems you can find is the camera direction."
3844,"In 2002's '40 Days and 40 Nights', Josh Hartnett's character tries just that. There's the fact that at one point he makes Erica orgasm using a flower, a fact that women will happily condemn at a moments notice (although most have probably tried after watching this film). The film hooks you in and subjects you to ninety minutes of torture. You feel like the ninety minutes have been worthwhile, even though they haven't, and you genuinely believe that the film is worth anyone's attention. The best thing this film has going for it, is the nice on - screen chemistry between the two leads."
3845,"Perhaps the single most impressive thing about the film is that it never casts its characters in a heroic light; they are simply soldiers who have been sent to do a job, and they do it knowing the risks, and they do it well in spite of the odds. The supporting female cast, seen early in the film and in shorter scenes showing the home front as the battle rages, is also particularly fine, with Julie Moore able to convey in glance what most actresses could not communicate in five pages of dialogue. The wives of the soldiers are believable. He brings all the sustained intensity of BHD in the action sequences, but introduces the NVA perspective, the wives' perspective and a far more charismatic and heroic central figure in Lt. Col. Hal Moore. The scenes with the wives getting the telegrams are poignant reminders of how war reaches beyond the battlefield."
8506,People laughed and a lot of people cried because the movie evoked emotions in everyone. Their purpose is to underline a certain emotion with subtle tunes. Parents of teenagers will enjoy and benefit from watching this movie. set in Rode Island the 4th of July makes a good backdrop for the story lines woven through out the film. SWIMMING UPSTREAM is the heart wrenching story of a 17 year old boy who is stricken with terminal leukemia and how he deals with this tragedy.
3854,"There are some really hilarious scenes and both Ice T and the con man put in excellent performances. Ice Cube and Mike Epps made a great duo in Next Friday and Friday After Next, and had numerous dialog scenes in the film that were utterly hilarious and clever. If you are a fan of Next Friday and Friday After Next, you will probably enjoy this "" fourth installment . "" It's in a four pack that includes all Ice Cube movies, and it stars Mike Epps as well. They both have pretty good comedic performances which along side the action directing makes a decent / tolerable action comedy."
3855,"Any movie version of ` The Time Machine' is destined to suffer from the structural inadequacies contained in the original source material (H. G. Wells' 19th Century novel of the same name). The Uber - Morlock was quite impressive, his seing the memories, dreams and nightmares of others seem to have left him with a lot of wisdom. The one smart Morlock â€“ kind of a bleached - out Star Wars Evil Emperor--had potential, but is so lame and aloof he tells Pearce to take his machine and go home? Everything that made the novel so powerful has been lost. This version of the H. G. Wells classic is quite different from the wonderful 1960 movie starring Rod Taylor."
3856,"Basically no plot, no suspense, no romance, no fun, no good jokes, no good sex--just a sorry attempt by some excellent movie makers to be cute with no payoff! This film took a risk by using well known actors, brilliant actors, making the public believe that this would be a film like all of the others. Soderbergh has left behind the slickness of Ocean's 11 and Erin Brockovich and made an experimental film that bristles with inventiveness."
3872,"The opening 3 -4-minute scene with "" Scat, "" is excellent as are subsequent interludes with him. They have combined state - of - the - art digital animation, the perfectly cast voice talents of Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Dennis Leary (among many others) to create a highly entertaining, family film with a strong message about cooperation, friendship and caring for your fellow herd members. All in all, Ice Age is a great movie and is proof on how much effort was put into 3d animations before Shrek 2 and The Incredibles came out. The individual characters were delightfully believable too, with the facial expressions of Ray Romano's â€˜ Manfred' being a particular treat. David Newman--yet another member of the Newman family of Hollywood composers--provides a superb score that is not intrusive yet serves to move the action along and, at times, is positively toe tapping."
3873,"This movie successfully recreated the feel of the game, and because it kept exposition to a minimum of what you needed to know for this particular story and didn't borrow from or revise any of the original characters or settings, it supported and strengthened the franchise. It had wonderful action, nice gore and the performances overall were exceedingly decent for what they needed to be for a video game adaptation. Milla has about one - and - a-half good action moments in this film, and the rest of the cast manages another two. The movie has a few moments of genuine atmosphere, but those have all come and gone by the twenty - minute mark. Marilyn Manson has also made a great job by composing some of his greatest soundtrack titles which really fit for this movie."
3874,"Deniro proves he can be a great Straight man again with some hilarious and spontaneous moments. Granted, the film seemed to take on many buddy - film conventions while trying to make fun of the concept, it goes without saying this film was genuinely funny. As a buddy cop movie it does nothing new at all but still manages to be fun even if it doesn't really have anything approaching big consistent laughs. Eddie was fun to watch working with people instead of CGI animals and rodents. William Shatner, playing himself, also generates some laughs, often at his own good - natured expense."
3896,"Reapers are blood - feeders, just like vampires, except they feed on humans as well as vampires, effectively making them an enemy of both, and their thirst is much stronger than the traditional vampire. The Reapers feed on vampires and humans, are immune to garlic and silver and threaten to rapidly multiple. Blade reluctantly agrees, knowing full well that the vampires could turn on him and Whistler if things go wrong. The vampire community who fear for their own lives team up with Blade to take on these new baddies. What remains is a series of fast and stylish action scenes, held together by a reasonable plot and a nice few little twists and turns to keep it engaging."
3897,"Of couse, the president of DOG, is a really hot blonde, who is supposed to be geeky because she wears glasses. For some good laughs, SORORITY BOYS rates a 6/10. The way that he says that, has to be one of THE funniest spoken lines in film history, it's just the way his mouth opens so wide to say it and. While it is definitely not the milestone movie for the 2002 year, it is funny and worth the time (if you like these types of movies)."
3898,"This film depicts the values and relationships of those types of families very well. But if you want to spend a couple of hours enjoying a good movie with a real message--go see "" Stolen Summer "". Well, ` Stolen Summer' is that rare American film which actually acknowledges that religion plays a key role in many people's lives. ` Stolen Summer,' because it deals gently with its people and its subject matter, may strike some as a bit too mild in tone, a bit too lacking in grit to be worth very much. Yes, one could perhaps wish for a bit more edginess at times - still, ` Stolen Summer' merits praise for bringing religion back into the mainstream of American movies."
3900,"The story of Clockstoppers centers around a very cute teenage boy who is good at a lot of things, extreme bike - riding with lots of incredible tricks, playing a guitar, riding a skateboard, fighting with his sister. Clockstoppers is most certainly made for teens, but adults will be able to sit back and enjoy the film without feeling talked down to. Bradford has numerous credits to his short career, including Hackers, but smiles far too often for his characters needs and even when he's upset or angry, the tell - tale smile is nearby. This is a real treat, and the best way to watch it is along with some Back to the Future movies. Looking at Clockstoppers in that light, it is a big success."
3901,"If you love Robin Williams and think he's one of the funniest men in the planet, if you're a fan of the great Edward Norton, if you think Catherine Keener is really hot, if you think Danny DeVito is a genius or if you simply wannahave a barrel of laughs--"" Death to Smoochy "" will keep you alive with pleasure. Of course the former host wants his job back and sets out to "" get "" Smoochy. Despite what you might have read from national critics, there are a lot of laughs in this film. Not for children, but the nature of plot (doesn't automatically capture any other audience), this sleeper comedy is a must see, because it breaks out of the mold of funny comedies into a more sophisticated, grown up form of laughter and comedical relief. Danny Woodburn--Mickey from "" Seinfeld ""--shows off his fine acting skills, playing more than just the "" little guy . """
3902,Anyway the movie was good at first specially because the camera amazing movements and CGI. David Fincher directs this cleverly conceived thriller about a mother and daughter trapped inside a panic room by three criminals. The film does well in exploring the confines of the house. 6 - It is incredible that both mom and daughter do not wonder what the criminals want from the room and try to negotiate. The catch is that the burglars' stash is in the very room in which Meg and her daughter are hiding!
3903,"Eventually, he reaches his goal of making it to the Major Leagues, even if it was a very brief stint. All the characters in here are nice people, the kind you root for, from Quaid to the players on his high school team, to his little boy (Angus T. Jones, now somewhat of a star on television.) And, most of this film is true, as testified by the real - life pitcher in one the documentaries on the DVD. What's also good about this is that it can be a great movie with no bad language or anything. Secondly is the bare honesty of the story, and that of the portrayals by a wonderful Quaid (at 47 here playing a 35 year old) and a likewise Griffiths."
3911,"Claire has been kept in the dark about her husbands past, but despite her doubts she still believes his innocence and takes it upon herself to act as his defence attorney with the help of a disgraced military lawyer (Morgan Freeman) The film is both suspenseful and intriguing, with very fine performance from all the cast. Caviezel delivered a strong portrayal of an enigmatic character in ` Angel Eyes', so he had some experience with this type of role. 6/10 should have been better, but it's watchable Ashley Judd, Jim Caviezel and Morgan Freeman are three attractive lead actors, all interesting to watch, as usual. Jim Caviezel rounds out the cast with a strong performance as the accused."
3912,"You will get endlessly entertained by swaying testicles, floating hot - tub testicles, Van kissing dog testicles in an early morning supprise. Boy has it good, boy gets told by father that he will not receive more easy money, boy has roaring good time as he crunches many business opportunities to raise money so he can continue with his chosen looserly lifestyle, boy meets overtly - cute pseudo-intelligent girl who wants an interview for the school paper, and wait for the supprise. If, on the other hand, you like vomit - inducing pranks, beautiful young girls flashing their boobies, and hilarious one - liners galore peppered by a huge dose of stereotypes (but without hatred), you will have one of the most entertaining 2 hours of your life. loaded with sexual humor and innuendo, Van Wilder keep the laughs coming. The two leading male actors, Ryan Reynolds and Kal Penn, are exceptional as usual, and Tara Reid, while she offers her customary wooden non-performance, fills out her role enough not to be painful."
3918,"On a critical day in both their lives, Doyle going to court to try winning joint - custody, and Gavin on his way to seal his career - making case, the two get into a minor accident on the FDR turnpike, causing Doyle to miss his hearing and Gavin to accidentally give Doyle a signed document that is critical to his case Enjoyed the great acting of Ben Affleck, (Gavin Banek) along with an outstanding performance by Samuel L. Jackson, (Doyle Gipson) who are total strangers until they both have an accident on the FDR in New York City. Uneven, but still strangely likable production has lawyer Ben Affleck and alcoholic insurance man Samuel L. Jackson having a minor accident on the freeway. A wild and crazed cat and mouse game then starts as the road rage flows over into both men's lives. Changing Lanes is much more complex than the trailer leads you to believe."
3920,"But it is a feel good movie with some great scenes. Think classic' young male purchasing condoms in family pharmacy mayhem' and maybe you'll have an idea what's to come - but they pushed the envelope to the edge. It is not a film for everyone and hey by now you should know what type of flicks you enjoy. but seriously, even with somewhat higher expectations, this one is worth watching. If you keep your expectations low, it's more likely to be positively surprised."
3923,"But he asks her out, and one thing leads to another and then another, but before Toula will allow things to get seriously out of hand, meaning ` serious,' she knows she must run up the flag, take a deep breath and tell her father. It's one of those rare cinematic experiences that afterwards makes the sky seem bluer, your step a bit lighter and a smile easier to come by; and when a film can do all of that, you know you've come across a bona fide treasure that you're going to hang onto for a long, long time in your memory. This is not something Toula wants to here, and eventually, she gains the courage to break out of her introverted shield and gradually change herself into a bold, lovely woman. Although Toula doesn't like her family is Greek in every single way, and is too proud of it, she does love her family. This movie has several very heartwarming and somewhat emotional scenes in it so don't expect it is just a funny movie."
3933,"He can convey charm and menace in equal measure and often in the same moment and confirms his status as one of the best young actors in movies at the minute. They were so confident that they had committed the perfect crime that they wanted to see first hand the difficulty the investigators would have in uncovering what they think is the truth. The movie cleverly makes you wonder which boy's in charge of the situation and there are some twists and turns and the boys show their underlying immaturity at various stages. Barbet Schroeder's "" Murder by Numbers "" starring Sandra Bullock is solid work, though not particularly compelling. It's about the perfect murder executed by two spoiled sociopath teenagers, Richard (Ryan Gusling) who is the cool one, and Justin (Michael Pitt) who is the sympathetic geek."
3934,"Dwayne Johnson plays a natural - born hero called Mathayus Led by Dwayne Johnson "" The Rock "" as Mathayus the Warrior with a heart, lovely Kelly Hu as Cassandra the Sorceress and object of beauty, sought by Steven Brand as Memnon the convincing evil menace of it all, and Michael Clarke Duncan as the equally brave ally Balthazar to Mathayus, this is your basic good vs. evil story splashed with fun and suspense - almost like an animated Disney film but with real live actors. It works and The Rock is very cool as said King (or Mathayus) and former Jason victim Kelly Hu is gorgeous as the scantily - clad Cassandra. In the movie "" green mile "" he played a guy 7 feet tall and 450 pounds. The action scenes were hard hitting and brutal and the scenery was fantastic as well."
3938,"Still, it was a pretty good film if you like moral movies. If sentimental schmaltz with few or no laughs is your definition of comedy, then you're in for a treat. ' Perhaps because this IS a romantic comedy, the best the film can manage to do within the tight strictures of the format is to raise a few of the more provocative issues surrounding the theme â€“ those dealing with the meaning of life and the vagaries of fate, for example â€“ then drop them so it can address itself to the customary clichÃ©s one would expect to find in a film of this genre. The story was actually fairly engrossing: Angelina Jolie's character (Lanie Kerrigan), who is a news reporter, is told by some strange street prophet, Jack (played by Tony Shaloub), that she will die in a week. Despite the fact that it has moments of quality and charm, the film, ultimately, feels like a case of lost opportunity."
3940,", and the very popular Disturbia, (Which is basically a reversion of Hitchcock's classic thriller Rear Window.) From the intricacies of the actual life he portrays to the unshown details of the tenderness of the characters heart, "" Salton Sea "" delivers a complete package of salty and sweet. It's not like LOTR or a Rocky movie where you come out feeling like you're on top of the world, but you will feel spun like by a great rollercoaster. Kilmer's performance was good and he held his own, but Vincent D'Onofrio was brilliant in his role of Poo bear. Val Kilmer is in the lead role as a tweaker of crystal meth, and other substances, as well as a quite good sounding trumpet player."
3950,"Like the comic book character of Daredevil, their other four senses are heightened. Like most of Woody's films, the cast is an ensemble of multi-talented actors who each contribute more than their own five cents into the work. As long as you don't proceed with gigantic expectations, you should have a lot of fun. The film has its typical Woody Allen jokes, and delivers in its comedy portions, very funny at times. Overall a fresh screenplay from Woody, with decent direction and good performances."
3951,"Admirers of the comic book tales should have no trouble liking the movie with its amazing CGI effects. The entire cast did a great job capturing the characters they were playing and there are some great fights as well. There are few of the painful cliches or dreadful dialogue that plague films like The Phantom Menace and the catchphrases like "" friendly neighbourhood spider - man "" are fully in - keeping with the character. One of the most successful translations of "" comic book to screen "" has fine results in SPIDER - MAN, a handsomely produced version of the comic book classic with a sprightly score by Danny Elfman and some incredibly realistic looking CGI effects. In fact, it has to be considered one of the best comic book adaptations ever."
3960,"But anyways onto the movie, The New Guy is actually a really funny high school comedy that is sure to deliver a few good laughs. Dj Qualls is becoming a really good actor, and he's got the role of the geek nailed. And of course DJ Qualls and Eddie Griffin were a hilarious on screen duo! If you can watch a movie without being hypercritical about how "" bad "" it is, then get this, sit back a have some laughs So as you can tell from the brief description of the movie, it does try to have its sexual jokes but aren't very offensive or sick like other teen movies."
3961,"Unfaithful works for viewers willing to put some thought into it that only works for those who want cheap thrills will probably be disappointed, but in all its a illusion of eternal bliss that will find this easily a satisfying picture. The acting by Richard Gere is some of his best work in a long time, but the tour deforce performance in he movie belongs to Diane Lane. Behind the obvious guise of a morality tale showing what can happen if you stray from your marital vows, there is a rather amazing piece of art to be seen. And in this respect,' Unfaithful' excells! While the committed performances are what make a great movie greater, it is Adrian Lyne who has constructed such a wonderful and effective rhythm and style to UNFAITHFUL."
3967,"Based on the great Nick Hornby novel, "" About A Boy "" walks a fine line, doling out easy laughs and real pathos with deceptive ease. A great many Hollywood brains should take note of what was accomplish in this film. Mr. Grant is just perfect for this role. For the sake of accuracy, both the novel and the film should more rightly be titled ` About TWO Boys,' since the story focuses not only on 12 - year old Marcus, but on 38 - year old Will, a man totally dedicated to the proposition that any man who so desires can live quite happily on his own private little urban island, thank you very much. Will's ` island' is his own London flat, which he has equipped with all the accoutrements of comfort and diversion that modern technology â€“ in the form of computers, big screen TV's and DVD players - can afford."
3968,"Lucas has always pushed the limits of technology, even inventing new technology all the way. By choosing to place Anakin Skywalker front and center as the story's main focal point, Lucas does what few others in this business are willing to do â€“ which is to risk making a crowd - pleasing epic without a likable central ` hero. The charm of Star Wars was gone before Lucas unveiled his uber - deluxe, special treatment of the films for the third time. Only when the movie is in action does ATTACK OF THE CLONES become worthwhile--there's a dizzying chase through Coruscant on floating cars, maneuvering through a dangerous asteroid field near a planet, and a half - hour long showdown that showcases a lot of amazing CG work. Flawless or not, this is still a STAR WARS movie, and for what it is, it's still worth a look."
3970,"It's a clever and tightly integrated work, a small masterpiece, where dialogue begets more dialogue, wry observations and witticisms proliferate, all of them ultimately spun into a seamless satirical whole. Again, what a lovely surprise this movie was with absolutely marvelous chemistry between Mr. Firth and Mr. Everett, a sweet supporting cast, not to mention the beautiful production values. This is the genius of the play: the play - goer might view all of the values of bourgeois society upheld while at the same time they are being made fun of. Asquith produced a brilliant film, a triumph of intelligence, style and taste, everything that Wilde and his admirers could have wished it to be - and everything that Parker's film is not. Some of the greatest adaptations--Elia Kazan's A Streetcar Named Desire from 1951 comes immediately to mind--played it straight and didn't try anything fancy."
3975,"Two thumbs UP for this little lady! Final verdict: good for some laughs, but not many. In real life situations outside of a movie people always have others that will help you."
3976,"Without giving anything away, INSOMNIA is definitely worth it. The original movie had a tiny budget and also an excellent cast, led by the terrific Swede Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd, growing as pale as that relentless sunshine during the course of the film; the usually haggard - looking Al Pacino interprets his insomnia visually through an ever more haggard face. Though the original film isn't given as the source material until well into the closing credits, this follows the main thrust of the story closely. Al Pacino is the perfect person to play an insomniac - his drooping eyes are suited to Dormer. There're some great cuts and moments indicating Pacino's extreme fatigue - still camera work, sound being drowned out, and so forth."
3977,"Some viewers may quibble about the politically correct aspects of the story (cavalry = bad, Indians = good), but there is a moment near the end that balances things out in an intelligent, dramatic way. Hans Zimmer's excellent music score does a far more effective job in conveying, in dramatic and emotional terms, what the songs belabor. The background art and western landscapes are stunning and offer a mix of painted scenes and computer - created scenery, although everything seems computer enhanced in one way or another. The music is fantastic, with songs by Bryan Adams, and music by Hans Zimmer, who also was responsible for the extremely popular music from the 1994 Disney hit, The Lion King. Picturesque depictions of wild horses and their grace could never have been more majestic in an animation flick."
3981,"Bates makes a nasty villain and Schrieber is good as the mysterious man with a past, Clark. Let Ben continue to do the romantic comedies and action movies, but leave the strong serial characters to someone who can truly embody the role. It's not even so much that the Nazis - as - bad - guys thing is an overused, now out of date cliche as much as the idea that they were Middle Eastern terrorists in Clancy's book and the writers and director Phil Robinson changed them smacks of pure political correctness."
3982,"One of the great "" high - profile "" stereotypes in white America are black people talking in theaters, or otherwise being loud and obnoxious in places and circumstances "" white "" Americans thinks inappropriate. Dave Chappelle is the funniest, but Chris Kattan, Eddie Griffin, Aunjanue Ellis, Denise Richards and the rest of the cast are also amazingly funny. And Chris Kattan is hilarious as Mr. Feather, an evil underling of The Man, devoted to the white man's dominance, but succumbing to hip - hop influence. Some viewers may complain about the black stereotypes, but you must look at it as black actors and filmmakers laughing at themselves. Undercover Brother is a smart and sassy comedy similar to Austin Powers."
3986,"It includes many funny scenes and the action is also good. It needed better, more original & well thought out action scenes, and better humor. If you can turn off your brain and lower your standards then this can be OK, however just don't expect it to be great no matter what you do."
3987,"What ensues is a warmly funny kind of jambalaya which makes up for its gaping plotholes with personality, charm, and rambunciousness as it stumbles through it story finally arriving gasping and wheezing at its feel good conclusion. When the daughter of one of them (Sandra Bullock), a successful playright, has an interview with Time magazine in which she condemns her mother's impact on her life, the mother (Ellen Burstyn, who is superb!) It might take 40 - odd years as it did them, or someone could get it the moment the child is born. A chick flick for chicks of all ages, "" The Divine Secrets of the Ya - Ya Sisterhood "" tells of four Louisiana ladies who establish their secret Ya - Ya sisterhood, bound by blood and oath and honor, at a young age and who remain friends over the years providing each other with friendship and support. In charges the other members of the Sisterhood, kidnapping Bullock, and attempting to make things right!"
3988,"The eccentric and energetic ` Cherish,' written and directed by Finn Taylor (` Dream with the Fishes') has the virtues of romance and thriller with a good dose of odd love. And the music is a star - the pop lyrics give meaning and nostalgia in a world where Zoe is confined by four walls but liberated by her imagination to become a passably good roller skater and lovable neighborhood oddity. Association hit "" Cherish "" is the titular song whose demented lyrics reflect the antagonist's sick obsession with a girl he can never have. A lot of problems with new indie films is that they try to be too artsy (with rapid cuts or industrial music) or too dark where you wind up loathing all of the characters. The genres (comedy / drama / thriller) meshed very well together to make a cohesive, entertaining piece."
3990,"As for realism, most of the action scenes are believable, no super-gadgets are to be seen, no incredibly lovely models fall madly in bed with Bourne, and the hero shows definite signs of physical vulnerability despite a very high level of training and competance. Matt Damon, who has the unfortunate nature of watching his less talented friend Ben Affleck gain notoriety for trash movies, is an excellent choice as the CIA operative turned amnesiac Jason Bourne. Subtle, yet still holding true to multiple action formulas (lots of fighting, cool weaponry, and chase scenes), this film presents a new era of action film making which could be all the wave. The fights in "" Bourne "" are fast, nasty, and very realistic while still being entertaining for the layman. After years of being on the run, Jason Bourne has finally been caught."
3991,"Okay, this film is rather sophmoric, but some of the jokes actually were effective, the special effects were very good (except for scooby - doo himself, who looked like something made on a home computer), and the creature designs were very creative. Matthew Lillard plays Shaggy well and plays off of Scooby - Doo well even though there was nothing there during filming. Matthew Lillard is brilliant as Shaggy (how is that possible? Lillard is amazing as Shaggy because he gets his voice to sound like a carbon - copy of the cartoon Shaggy. Matthew LILLARD IS Shaggy: he reproduces perfectly the attitude of the animated character and his capacity to make you believe in the virtual Scooby is very impressive: when he's with him, you feel like if the dog was really on the set."
3992,"The film only has one purpose, to show off how the brave marines kill as many enemy soldiers as possible. Gather your friends, bust open a few cans of beers and enjoy the "" Plan 9 from Outer Space "" of the 21st century! Every time the Marines are in trouble, up jumps good old Nicolas Cage with his Thompson and POOF! Warning: SPOILERS If you live in the UK, a good guide to the quality of any movie is the review it gets in the best - selling' News of The World' Sunday paper. No matter, the scenes that show the developing friendship between the two seargeants (Cage and Christian Slater) and the codetalkers (Beach and Roger Willie) gives Windtalkers its heart."
3993,"1 sound and a mild bunch of extras. This worked very well in Terry Zwigoff's "" Ghost World, "" but there are times in "" The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys "" where the tone threatens to go from comedy - drama, to flat - out drama, to flat - out comedy. As far as revisiting adolescence is concerned, "" The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys "" is accurate, funny, and even sad. Francis uses to fantasize reality with the fantastic situations the heroes face against the evil Nunzilla / Pegleg, a dark caricature of Sister Assumpta. ' The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys' is actually a great coming - of - age tale set in the Catholic school setting of the 1970s."
4001,"This film is good for a few good laughs. If you're looking for some genuine laughs, and some of those "" it's so bad, it's good "" scenes, then this is the right movie. It has some fun moments, and it is not that bad movie. The way Miguel A. Nunez made this person want to play basketball was really hilarious a amusing. Queers and peers, feast your eyes on Juwanna Mann, a cliche flick w / no surprises, yet intriguing nonetheless."
4002,"And so begins one of the most unusual and creative animated films from the Disney studios. Featuring a completely new style of drawing, and backgrounds that look like watercolor paintings, Disney is taking a bold step in trying something a little different. The dialogue and slapstick comedy is much more reminiscent of Warner Brother's beloved "" Loony - Tunes . "" Except for a handful of well chosen Elvis Presely songs, and some beautiful Hawaiian music, there are none of the musical numbers that one would expect to find in a typical Disney film. The creators of the film do a superb job with the character of Lilo, making you identify with her loneliness and isolation without making it depressing."
4003,"Just look back 50 years into the past and you should be able to see why. The plastic, chrome and glass sets, objects and architecture all looked clean and functional and the way that they suck the color out of a scene worked well and gave the film a distinctive palette. The direction and performances are amazing - the pre-visualization on this movie must have been a nightmare and yet all the incredible special effects blend perfectly into a visual style that is completely natural and assured, as might be expected from Spielberg and Michael Kahn. There are, of course, numerous references and homages to the work of Stanley Kubrick, which have given a hint of the edge and flair of' Clockwork Orange' or' 2001'. Full marks, five stars, a must see several times and buy the DVD movie."
4004,"There is some controversy over just how factual the film and its bases are (including the book by the real - life Molly Craig's daughter, Doris Pilkington), and there were some interesting parallels to the situation depicted in the film and behind the scenes facts about star Sampi and director Phillip Noyce. The most unforgettable scene comes early in the film when the children are forcibly torn from their mothers. It was wonderful scenes like these that was played out visually without having to dumb it down with words. The wonderful aborigine actor David Gulpilil (Walkabout) plays a scout that is tracking the girls and Kenneth Branaugh plays an officer that is in charge of the whole operation. Not exactly cheerful or uplifting but a powerful story that deserves 90 minutes of your time."
4005,"Mary Steenburgen, Ralph Waite, Jane Alexander, Bill Cobbs are all perfectly cast for their roles. Great cast includes Edie Falco (The Sopranos), Angela Bassett, Timothy Hutton, James McDaniel, Alan King and Mary Steenburgen. He keeps things honest and all of his work is based on personal choices. One angle has Eunice Stokes (Mary Alice) living in a house that she has lived in for a number of years and she's proud because the house represents being elevated to middle class. This is a very good movie, with deep characters and a story with multiple layers."
4006,"there are a lot of pop cultural references, some modern, some older, but many adults will get them. the movie isn't particularly hilarious, but it does have some amusing moments, and even one or two quite funny parts. the movie should have 3D and anime CGI to make the movie fun. Arnold didn't accomplish something as monumental as all the others. it's a great movie for any movie buffs with indiana jones, hulk, speed, prisoner, fugitive references, oh, beautiful."
4007,"Though Pam initially hopes to just get a good story on the new heir, she eventually falls for the kind - hearted Deeds while realizing that all she's done is lie to him and wants to be with him. If you're not afraid of real movies that don't have sex, toilet jokes, animal abuse, then you'll love the real thing. Here Winona Ryder steps in as the ambitious TV reporter determined to get her big scoop and dupes the affable Deeds into falling in love with her. The story is major news, and reporter Babe Bennett, who works for a tabloid show, has a friend pretend to steal her purse in sight of Deeds, because their research indicated Deed wanted to meet a girl by saving her, the same way his father had met his mother. As Mother Teresa once said, kindly words are heard once but their echoes are heard for ever - Deeds' character and his deeds (pun definitely intended) themselves are echoes of another, lamentably more innocent time and it's uplifting to see this spirit so laboured in the film's remake."
4010,"The basketball player "" big brother "" Morris Chestnut worked well as a trouble gifted basketball player who reluctantly takes Bow Wow under his wings and albeit predictable softens up in his parental role with the youngster. Pint - size rap music star Lil Bow Wow stars in it where he shows that he can play ball as well as he raps in this youth - oriented comedy about a young boy whose dream comes true in an unexpected way. Obviously the movie was a bit of a fantasy with a boy finding mystical shoes that gave him the skills of Michael Jordan; but hey, that is what made the movie as good as it was. While the tough but caring Sister Theresa tries to encourage the kids, Calvin knows that he and most of the other kids his age are poor prospects for adoption. Calvin is convinced they once belonged to Michael Jordan, but he can hardly believe what happens when he puts them on--suddenly he's able to make superhuman jump shots and dunks just like a miniature version of Air Jordan himself."
4011,"The makers of that film pulled off this feat of gravitational legerdemain by coming up with a concept and a script overflowing with creativity, wit, imagination and a cachet of ` hipness' to go along with its tone of anarchic playfulness. Without that aura of cutting edge newness that defined the original, ` Men in Black II' seems like just another loud, over-the-top summertime blockbuster. Smith and Jones still appear to be quite comfortable in their roles and they are aided by Lara Flynn Boyle, as Serleena, the baddest alien this side of Darth Vader, and Rip Torn, delightful as Zed, the slightly cracked head of the Men in Black agency. The first Men in Black is a great movie, still funny and entertaining after all these years. The special effects are pretty good, although a few moments have jarring mistakes, like Jeff breaking out from the ground and knocks J to the side, then the next shot, he's completely gone."
4012,"The cartoon is cute enough, and the writing is always sharp, with little in - jokes or puns thrown in. The characters are oddly endearing, and there are many moments of warmth and just feeling good. Released in 2002 to a rather pithy box office take (read: bomb), The Powerpuff Girls Movie is nonetheless a great way to kill 80 minutes. Monsters, Inc. was a good if fluffy entry from Pixar. Yet ultimately what makes this movie shine is what's buried beneath this cream puff movie, a message about accepting the gifts that make one special and unique as well as the importance of showing love to those that are shunned and deemed "" freaks ""."
4013,"A crocodile swallows a top - secret American device that two intelligence agencies set out to retrieve in Queensland, Australia. In this movie, Steve Irwin (may he rest in peace) mistakes some U. S. Government agents for poachers when they are after a crocodile who has swallowed a beacon. Steve Irwin the Crocodile Hunter plays - well - Steve Irwin the Crocodile Hunter in a fun adventure type movie with little in the way of a believable story line but lots of information about Australia's crocodiles and venomous snakes and spiders. Strangely, though, for all the fun and laughs involved here the movie seemed to go on longer than its allotted 90 minutes. Perhaps Irwin is better in half hour segments."
4014,"The script had its moments but the production work and set - design were simply awesome. The first specimen to be unleashed is discovered by a young London lad named Quinn Abercrombie who, 18 years later, has grown up to be the hunky Christian Bale, leader of a group of survivors holed up in a kind of mountainside fortress with very little hope for a future. Movies like ` Reign of Fire' pretty much preclude any real critical analysis. And the characters are at least allowed to show their human side at times, displaying various amounts of fear, uncertainty and emotional vulnerability even at those moments when they are having to be at their most daring and heroic. More clever moments like that would have helped make ` Reign of Fire' a more distinctive film than it currently is."
4015,"The atmosphere of the period, all the backgrounds and decorations are perfectly created, editing and cinematography are almost flawless while the story is well written. Tom Hanks does excellent and has one of the best performances of his career in a quite unusual role for him and all acting across the board is superb. This is noir with a dark palette, costuming in clothes metaphorically heavy, and sounding often as stylized and minimal as the murders Hanks commits. ` Road to Perdition' lacks the grandeur of Coppola's ` Godfather' epic, but it succeeds in evoking an old - testament judicial system where eye meets eye and tooth savages tooth. The movie also explores the love and disappointments that attend the father - son relationship."
4022,"It's the kind of fun movie they use to make in the fifties. Nonetheless, it's a fun ride with some genuinely scary parts and some humor, too. Each of these movies gives the scientific names and characteristics of the different spiders involved (before the radiation takes effect), and does a super job of presenting their habits and idiosyncrasies. Eight Legged Freaks (and that IS a perfect title, by the way) is coming out to be one of the best popcorn rollarcoasters of the summer. Part of the fun of this movie is that it * isn't * trying to educate anybody about the environment, the ozone layer, global warming, or terrorist attacks."
4023,"K - 19 is a unique entry with a poignant portrayal of the other side of the Iron Curtain, showing the rest of the world the courage and the honour of the Russians to their mother land. The settings, the story telling, the performances, the direction, the music, the tension, the interaction and chemistry between the characters, the authenticity and best of all the cast truly made this film a "" masterpiece "". The officers are sitting around enjoying some vodka and one of them brings up the cosmonaut hero Yuri Gagarin. The film would be worth watching for just these two fine performances. The progression of the matrix of dynamic personalities, their judgments, reservations, disputes, and suspicions, their pressing on despite less - than - perfect circumstances, and their relation to edicts from on high resemble what is probably more the norm for any complex, formal organization--not the least of which is the film - making enterprise, and more than likely, wherever you earn your daily keep."
4024,"Other than that, nothing but good messages were heard and seen all around and this is a funny movie, to boot. The only funny thing in this movie is Snowbell, the white cat of the Little's family. More so than in the first one, the picture is kept upbeat by the hilarious presence of Snowbell the cat, voiced by Nathan Lane, who has one terrific one - liner after another. So the freshness is reduced, but this still isn't stale - the charm and humour of the first movie remains, Michael J. Fox and Nathan Lane are as adept as ever as Stuart and Snowbell ("" This better be important . "" The filmmakers made the right choice to film it as a family picture, incorporating elements that children can understand but leaving in great moments of comedy to keep the adults interested."
4025,"On top of that, after the almost 15 mins of deleted scenes, is a very funny selection of outtakes, showcasing Myers talents at their best (Dr Evil / Austin Powers) and worse (Fat Bastard / Goldmember). Mike Myers is funny, and Beyonce Knowles is surprisingly good too, but Michael Caine isn't given the right material to shine and the Osbournes cameo verges on the pointless. The best scenes included Dr. Evil's prison rap video, and the suggestive subtitles in Mr. Roboto's office. Nevertheless, ` Austin Powers in Goldmember' works well if you enjoy a comedy where the actors seem for once to have been actually having a fun time while making it. Also in attendance are the usual suspects: Verne Troyer as Mini-Me, Michael York as Basil, Robert Wagner as Number 2, Seth Green as Scottie and Mindy Sterling as Frau Farbissinia."
4026,"Evans is probably better known today for his cocaine conviction, blink - and - you - missed - it marriage to Catherine Oxenberg and the tell - all bestselling autobiography this documentary is loosely based on. If anything, this film is worth watching for two scenes: When Evans tells the story of his near - suicidal moments that are harrowing in itself, but is accompanied by appropriate images from some of the films he produced. You'll get gossip aplenty but you'll also get insight in this is a warts - and - all portrait of a unique Hollywood personality, a kid who, deservedly, still remains in the picture. While he would be the first to admit that his epically scaled lapses have been grist for the tabloid mill, Evans also deserves to be remembered as the man who midwived such classics as ROSEMARY'S BABY and THE GODFATHER and that definitive Chandlerian dissection of Los Angeles, CHINATOWN. But, as KID makes abundantly clear, Evans' spectacular if unlikely career path owes far more to the well - established link between the manic depressive temperament and creativity than CARPETBAGGERS - type pulp fiction."
4031,"In addition to the celebrity walk - ons (Bo Derek, Jesse Ventura, Paula Abdul, among others), Harold Gould, James Brolin, Jennifer Espinoto, Brent Spiner and Edie McClurg are all good sports who deserve better material than what they have been handed here."
4032,"the human body consists 90 +% of water, which the aliens cannot handle. And the top price goes to: j) Alien communication can best be observed on baby monitors! Sixth Sense was extremely clever and very frightening, Unbreakable was one of the first movies to take comics seriously and was also very cleverly written. Most of all, Shyamalan is an expert craftsman and knows how to get the most out of space, actors and sound. Advanced beings who have mastered Space Travel but have a deadly aversion to water choose to invade a planet where every breath you take is full of moisture, the atmosphere is full of moisture so guess the outcome."
4034,"After enjoying some success with the surprisingly enjoyable & cheesy "" Spy Kids, "" Director (and all around good guy) Robert Rodriguez now brings forth a sequel, "" Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams "" which is far less enjoyable and far more cheesy. The plot revolves around a device known as a "" transmooker ""--which can be best described as the ultimate cloaking device, even able to cloak entire islands off the map. It also has the wonderful ability to render all electronic devices useless, which is quite a thorn in the side of the intrepid Spy Kids, who's reliance on James Bond style fancy gadgets is only a shade less than an alcoholic's dependence on his next drink. If Daniel Rodriguiez is such a fan of Harryhausen, then he should make "" The 8th Voyage of Sinbad "" or some such thing, rather than trying to find a way to incorporate Ray's creatures into a movie allegedly about espionage. Rodriguez is perhaps the only filmmaker of kids' movies that seems to actually listen to what kids want and in the process delivers something every family member can indulge in--it's as delicious as chocolate, with plenty of giggles aimed at the seven to ten crowd and dazzling ideas and humor that parents can appreciate."
4035,"Jennifer Anniston gives a beautiful, heartfelt performance in ` The Good Girl,' a film totally in tune with the rhythms of everyday life. At the age of 30 then, Justine is ripe for some kind of life - changing experience when in walks Holden Worther, an introverted, obviously disturbed young co-worker who sees in Justine the very soul mate he has been searching for all his life, a person who will understand him and share his hatred for the life they are both leading. Yet, something keeps Justine rooted to the spot, something that makes her understand that any decision she makes will end up hurting someone in the end besides herself. Anniston, who is probably in every scene in the film, carries the picture with her rich and highly empathetic performance. John C. Reilly as Justine's husband, Phil, and Deborah Rush as Gwen Jackson, Justine's sometime confidante at the store, also provide memorable, telling performances."
4036,"The film has fewer plot holes than most murder mysteries; leans more toward human interest than derring - dos; and is another example of Eastwood successfully pushing out the age envelope in a self - directed film product. Recommended for more mature couch potatoes into murder mysteries. Clint Eastwood's 20th feature directed and starring himself, Blood Work, is a good sign in times of recent thriller drek. He retires, and two years later a woman comes forth to him asking for help in finding a killer. And anyway, what makes Blood Work so fascinating (if only up to a point if seen more than once) is that it's a well crafted thriller, one that has the usual police procedural from many years back, a bit of a romance with Wanda DeJesus, and comic relief from Jeff Daniels."
4037,"Crazy, mind - blowing, awesome (and in some cases, of course, obviously impossible) extreme stunts! The story structure mirrors that of the franchise of cramming in several different locations because it seemed like a good idea at the time, so much so you find yourself forgetting what the original plot was, there's a femme fatale and the bad guy wants to start effectively world war three. Though the plot is as unrealistic as most movies of this genre, the stunts are a lot more believable than you'll find in most. Samuel Jackson gets to play his typical gruff shouting role that he has made his own and there are several stunts that are truly breathtaking, it is just sad that one of these led to the stuntman performing it's death. You can always depend on one thing in these type of movies, from the "" biker movies "" of the '50s to today's films: the hero will always be a rebel against authority and any laws of the land."
4038,"24 Hour Party People is the story of Factory Records, a defiantly eccentric independent record label based in Manchester, England, which discovered acts as influential and diverse as Joy Division and the Happy Mondays. The story really starts with an early Sex Pistols gig in Manchester, attended by only 42 people, most of whom went on to have an influence on the Manchester music scene of the next 10 years. Wilson was in the audience, together with members of the band who went on to form the brilliant post-punk pioneers Joy Division. Joy Division's lead singer, Ian Curtis, is portrayed so accurately by Sean Harris that it's positively eerie, and the scenes of the band playing in rundown venues seem remarkably true to life and capture effectively the rawness and intensity of their live performances. The scenes of drugs - and - sex - excess on the Monday's tour bus and the re-creation of the Hacienda club nights are superbly portrayed."
4045,"In all honesty, the story is clichÃ©, but it actually works quite well. The special effects (which were unfairly criticized at the time) are surprisingly good, considering they were from 2000 (remember, the film was finished but shelved for two years), and the direction of Ron Underwood is quite nice. Murphy, Dawson and Quaid are all great in their roles, and supporting characters are played very well by some big names, such as Peter Boyle, Pam Greir, Burt Young and even a cameo by Alec Baldwin. But is it a halfway decent film with some laughs and some heart? This was a really cool movie considering no one makes cool sci - fi movies much."
4046,"Although that is, indeed, part of her life's plan, Anne Marie is, also, an intelligent, pragmatic young woman, fully aware of both her strengths and weaknesses and just trying the best she knows how to make her life work for her, the young sister in her charge and the two surf buddy girlfriends she lives and works with. Equally compelling are Michelle Rodriguez and Sanoe Lake as her fun - loving buddies, Mika Boorem as her little sister, and Matthew Davis as the professional football quarterback who becomes her love interest. Director John Stockwell, to his credit, manages to keep the majority of the scenes intimate in tone and realistic in nature, rarely allowing the narrative to wander into overwrought melodrama or teen - movie farce. Seeing the waves crashing fifteen feet tall, it is definitely worth seeing in theaters to get the full effect. While it Anne Marie is quite attractive she is far from movie star beautiful, there is this natural and real quality to her that, if anything, makes her all the more endearing."
4048,"Confronted with this startling, revolutionary and, perhaps, priceless piece of information, Roland sets out to unravel the mystery, accompanied by Maud Bailey (Gwyneth Paltrow), an expert on the life and work of Miss LaMotte (and a distant descendant of that famed poet in the bargain). Randolph and Christabel are both products - and victims - of their Victorian Era morality, yet at the same time, their struggles are universal in nature and neatly correspond to those experienced by Roland and Maud, who literally follow in the footsteps of the earlier couple. As they tentatively grope towards one another, then back away out of fear of pain and rejection, Roland and Maud define, in many ways, the mÃ©tier of modern romantic coupling. Director LaBute has drawn wonderful performances out of his quartet of first - rate actors. The first movie from Neil Labute (' In the Company of Men') was an amazing film."
4049,"Romanek also approaches interesting themes about what photographs mean i. e. proof of ones existence (beautifully explained in the film). There are a few very minor flaws such as a few scenes where reality is suspended but overall this is a cleverly chilling film that deserves to be watched but do not expect lots of murder, bloodshed, or silly twists like boiling a live rabbit. the directors (romanek) flair for colour synchronicity and immaculate art direction does not stray far from his beginnings as a music video director, however it is this attention to detail and precision that accentuates williams when he chooses to lose the plot. a memorable scene in the film of william's characters eyes squirting blood is in stark contrast to the ordered white formica and polished chrome surfaces that intimate to the spectator a feeling of staring intently at snapshots of a desperate man's life. Here, he plays "" Sy, the photo guy, "" a lonely employee in the photo department of a suburban Target / Walt - Mart / / K - Mart - whatever who lives vicariously through a nice family, whose family pictures he has developed and printed for years."
4050,"A depressed visionary film director who can't compete with hype and egotism and whose obsession with his own artistic integrity has lead his career down a dead - end street, Taransky, with his career on the ropes, is contacted by a man offering salvation in the form of the perfect actor - a computer generated woman named S1m0n3. Simone's success propels Taransky's career into the limelight, permitting him to simultaneously lampoon all that he has come to despise in Hollywood and to vicariously gain acceptance in it for himself. Taransky's invented discovery successfully brings a few of his most cherished cinematic visions to the screen and eventually overshadows him completely. Winona Rider is typically superb in her relatively brief role, and the performances in this film are generally good, but Pacino's acting is just a hair under his usual perfection in this one. Since this film is, for both Taransky and his family, a story of hard lessons learned about themselves, at least one epiphany scene might have been appropriate."
4051,"What distinguishes this guy's movie are a couple things: the expert and lean direction of Hill, the crisp and intelligent script by David Giler and Hill, and one of the best boxing fight scenes ever done in the movies. While there he learns that Monroe Hutchen (Wesley Snipes) is the "" undisputed "" champ at Sweetwater, and he has been undefeated champion for ten years. Rhames takes what could have been a Mike Tyson caricature, and transformed him into a complex and empathic character. Snipes looks amazing as a boxer--body movement and combinations. Rhames also looks very impressive and fearsome."
4061,"(Cinenygma) - One of the executive producers, who introduced the film, said it wasn't 100% finished yet, and that even the title might change. Maniacal laughter, bug - eyed expressions of madness, flashing lights, tilted camera angles. But, when the plot of a film is neither logical nor entertaining you get one movie: FeardotCom FeardotCom may very well be the worst of those films."
4062,"Ironically, whyat makes the the movie light - hearted is the honest and probably realistic reactions to many of the little speeches as well as certain actions that the main character has. The action scenes were exciting, original and very, very cool. In a series of graphic sex scenes (including a full frontal view of Treach's impressive manhood) the romance gets red hot and it's only a matter of time before Damien lets Treach know that love isn't healthy in his line of work. Another unique aspect is that the majority of the movie is the main character reflecting on how he became a a hitman, eventually going into into his confusion over his presetn situation and comparing it to another similar event in which he fall s on love with a fellow hitman (or hitwoman to be more accurate). The final martial arts bout at the end clearly shows its Legend of drunkne master unfluence with the villian fighting mainly on one foot and at oppne time balancing himself on one foot in a kick stance."
4065,"Unlike ` Fatal Attraction,' which at least managed to achieve a level of credibility before it went off the deep end in the final act, ` Swimfan' never establishes a believable tone. Swimfan is fine, but is only really a stepping - stone movie onto bigger and (hopefully) better things for the lead actors. Given the high school age of the main characters in "" Swimfan "", and given background music that is mostly sophomoric, the film is clearly targeted at people under the age of twenty - five. If the script is weak, the acting is generally pretty good, with reasonably effective performances from Jesse Bradford, Erika Christensen, and James DeBello as Dante. About the only interesting aspect of ` Swimfan' is how it shows that, in this technologically advanced age, a genuine stalker now has so many more options at his or her disposal â€“ answering machines, cell phones, pagers, voice mail, email, instant messages."
4068,"People who live in the suburbs can watch in the knowledge that they're getting a window into another culture, while people in urban communities can watch this with a comforting sense of familiarity. The characters are well rounded, with both positive and negative traits and the movie is not surrounded by guns, single mothers and drugs. One of the films best quotes is' Do nt buy yourself a Benz when your living with your mama! Added to this the well - rounded nature of the film is a diatribe from Cedric The Entertainer (who's performance is almost as hilarious as his stand - up act) about black icons such as Rosa Parks, Jesse Jackson and Martin Luther King. While Cedric the Entertainer took most of the acting plaudits, this was a great ensemble piece that was well acted all round."
4069,There are some truly funny moments in this film (especially the ones with the widower) and it is quite amusing for a good laugh. Dennis Farrina as Lee's boss and soon to be father in law gives a great performance in this as he tries to catch Lee at anything and everything.
4070,"In addition to Statham, who makes for a very ` cool' action film hero, Francois Berleand turns in a wonderful performance as a shrewd, wisecracking police inspector who knows that Frank is up to something but who has enough faith in his own instincts to at least give the man the benefit of the doubt. What's more, she is bent on stopping her father and this makes both of them targets of the organization. This movie has all the makings of a great testosterone flick. It starts with a wild car chase in France, introduces some memorable phrases, adds an attractive woman and antagonist with a very bad hair piece. All action movies should strive to be this imaginative!"
4072,"One of the greats, with memorable characters you'll think about for days. Igby is the anti Ferris Beuhler - a smart wannabe who's wise mouth and attitude usually piss off those around him - his mother, his brother, his godfather. The key women, Sarandon, Peet and Danes all play fully formed characters. Goldblum is perfect for his role, his usual facile acting style well suited to the South Hampton prince he plays; his best turn in years. Seers has style and flow, and his final cut is aided by the excellent music choices he and his music supervisor, Nick Harcourt arrived at."
4086,"The only two things "" Ballistic "" had going for it were the presence of some rarely - seen hardware (fun for you firearms buffs) and some spectacular action sequences (though these were plagued by some annoying clichÃ©s, such as a protective vest preventing all injury to a character, and henchmen showing complete disregard for personal safety), and these were simply not enough to save this turkey. But as the body count rises and the explosive set pieces get ever noisier, they realise they must work together to defeat the sinister Robert Gant (Gregg Henry) who has played both off against each other. It may well be "" a bullet - ballet of action "" (according to the box) but "" Ballistic: Ecks Vs Sever "" is a shockingly bad admission to the overcrowded action genre. So that's 15 seconds worth watching out of a movie that lasts 90 minutes or so."
4087,"This is one of the best of this year in terms of mainstream film. The newest rendition of the Four Feathers is a real epic, aesthetically beautiful, sweeping, completely refreshing in terms of emotional presentation and scope for both characters and audience. The 4 different comrades of Harry's, plus Adu (Hounsou's character), have faces and lives and are important to the flow of the story, though they seem fairly unimportant till it matters (again, don't want to give anything away), when something happens to them, you want to know, and care about, what will become of them. This other man belonged to a tribe of slaves, spoke English and Arabic, but was a Christian. In other words, everything about the movie was good, right up to before it was to be edited to 2 hours."
4088,"Otherwise, if they had stuck to the basic plot, this could have been a nice little thriller, especially because on average, the acting was pretty good (especially Charlize Theron and Kevin Bacon). What begins as a stylish thriller with good psychodramatic potential abandons the mind games at the half way point, trades nuances for sledge hammer blows, and disintegrates in a ball of Hollywoodish convoluted anything - for - the - thrill fire. The central story focuses on Theron and Bacon, and both make for one of the more effective protagonist / antagonist duos in recent memory. BOTTOMLINE: If you like thrillers, go see this on a matinee--worth seeing on the big screen for some beautiful cinematography of the Pacific Northwest and the climax. Dakota Fanning also shines as the kidnapped daughter; this is one of the best performances from a child actor all year (the other is from Fanning herself in the miniseries Taken)."
4090,"Maggie Gyllenhaal is outstanding in a potential minefield of a role - she handles it with dignity and even provides some effective dark humour. He brings an icy steel to the troubled Grey, but also provides a touch of black humour which comes at some great moments to' release the tension'. For the themes supplied here you'd probably expect a lot of raunchiness - well there are sexual moments, of course, but there is nothing gratuitous, which is in itself an achievement and well handled. This movie transcends its gentle S&M to reveal yet another way to love. Spader is type - cast a bit, but his world - weary sexiness fits well with Gyllenhaal's naivetÃ©."
4092,"Applying the same legal standards to which Pinochet and Milosevic have been held, Hitchens branded Dr. Kissinger as a war criminal who should be brought to justice for crimes against humanity. Narrated by actor Brian Cox, the documentary is presented in lively "" 60 Minutes "" fashion using archival footage, background music, and a combination of interviews with Kissinger associates and journalists such as Seymour Hersh, William Safire, and Hitchens himself. The Trials of Henry Kissinger is timely and the idea that statesman should be held accountable for their actions under International Law is a compelling issue that deserves to be debated in public forums. ' The Trials of Henry Kissinger', directed by Eugene Jarecki and written by Alex Gibney (adapted from Christopher Hitchens' book) is definitely a film that, if it were actually given a wide enough audience, would provoke some fairly strong reactions. Inflammatory, but extremely thought - provoking,' The Trials of Henry Kissinger' is a film that should be viewed."
4093,The first and last scenes complement each other very well.
4094,"The fight scenes are classic, and one when he encounters "" The Godfather of Soul "". The whole joy of watching his movies is the sheer talent and relentless energy he demonstrates while doing all of his own stunts. If you enjoyed Jim Carrey's "" The Mask, "" you might enjoy this Jackie Chan film. It has a similar storyline but instead of a mask, it's a suit someone puts on and receives some supernatural powers. It's all extremely silly but with a lot of slapstick and outrageous scenes, you are going to get some great laugh - out - loud scenes and some really stupid not - funny stuff."
3794,"AWTR contains a heartfelt conclusion to a story where you get to care about Landon and Jamie, two polar opposite teenagers who face peer struggles and the perils of love and death. AWTR succeeds in delivering a great experience. And despite the sadness it inevitably brings (which is not necessarily bad) it also brings innocence, sweetness, optimism - yes, that too - and faith in life and love and the ability of every single person for change, the ability - and the obligation - to become better. This movie doesn't have an original plot, but it is good because of the 2 leads give wonderful performances. Performances are competent and heartfelt, Shane West gives an admirable portrayal of an angry young man on a path of reformation."
4096,"This film is perfect if your looking for a good cry but with some humorous bits too, in fact this films got everything you want in a drama, joy, sadness, hope, fear the lot. These beautiful little moments are what make the film. Imagine a movie that deals with relationships between strangers and family, love and hate. Each deliver a beautiful performance with the help of director and writer Brad Silberling, a genius who you should be sure to be on the look out for. Gyllenhaal's climatic monologue near the end of the film will give you goosebumps."
4097,"The movie certainly works for children, but those familiar with the Veggie franchise understand that much in the same way as Bugs Bunny, The Flintstones, and the Muppets that much of the humor is for the adults. Happy movie watching, and stick around through the credits for a cute little addition! And that is very refreshing considering that many animated features these days can't make up their minds if they are for children or adults (Dreamworks studios being the biggest culprit). This is a fine and funny film for kids of all ages (Including 38). PS - one of the best parts is the credits song after the movie;) 10 out of 10 stars - **********"
4098,"It's to serial killer, suspense films as "" The Godfather "" is to mafia movies. With strong supporting performances from Emily Watson as Reba a blind woman who is in love with the killer (but she doesn't know who he is) and Harvey Keitel as Agent Jack Crawford Wills boss and friend. It worked because not only do you have the incomparable Hopkins at Dr. Lecter but you have one this generations best actors, Edward Norton, as the leading character "" Will Graham . "" Sure, some scenes are structed the same, but to be fair this latest installment is closer and more true to the novel. Ted Tally took some license and beefed up the character for some crucial scenes, adding a very interesting and inventive twist."
4099,"This movie is a very realistic depiction of the defining moment of the "" troubles "" in Northern Ireland. The hand - held cameras and grainy film style make it feel more like a documentary than a movie, which of course is the intent. The film showed stones being answered by guns and gas. Cities are complicated social ecologies, and the film shows a great diversity of attitudes and pressures on all sides, managing to be both clinical in meticulous detail and visceral in shocking impact. It is worth noting that this is based on the Irish Governments review of the Widgery report into Bloody Sunday."
4100,"It enlivens the senses, touches the heart, and moves you with little dialog. Ribisi is stunning as the outwardly simple, infatuated boy - like man with subtly revealed inner strength and cunning. Cate Blanchett should get an Oscar for keeping a straight face. After messing around with "" moral complexity "" the movie opts for being a love story and the luscious cinematography serves it well. Whether it be drama, comedy, period pieces or whatever, you can always count on an outstanding performance from this lady."
4112,"Below was written by Lucas Sussman, Darren Aronofsky and the film's director, David N. Twohy; Aronofsky is the smart filmmaker behind the art - house hit Requiem for a Dream, and Twohy has consistently specialized in sophisticated "" B "" pictures like The Arrival and Pitch Black. Twohy's direction is an example of economic brilliance--the flick charges forward, piling on the twists and scares methodically, but never gratuitously--thankfully, this is a horror flick that's more about mood than about gore--indeed, it's less in tune with modern splatterfests than it is an homage to the cerebral Val Lewton thrillers of the 1940s (like The Seventh Victim or Isle of the Dead). An added bonus is the cast of smart players: Bruce Greenwood as the sub commander trying to hold his crew and himself together; Matt Davis as the wet - behind - the - ears officer not really accepted by the crew; Olivia Williams as an English nurse who is both suspect and suspicious; and Holt McCallaney as a gruff officer. score is to be honest down to people who'd rather watch a documentary on WW II. There is very little in this film beyond the subject matter to justify anything stronger than a PG - 13."
4113,"Avary's adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' book does a great job of showing that these are bad things the characters are doing. Sossamon does a great job of capturing the many mixed emotions her character feels. Ian Somerhalder is also very good as the other lead character, the bisexual Paul Denton. His scenes are easily the funniest in the movie. Roger Avary has made "" The Rules of Attraction "" a very highly stylized film."
4114,"First of all it is a good thing the movie keeps the attention in the middle of everything. Although that is not a good thing in most movies it works perfectly here. They are sweet together, have some nice scenes. Although you sometimes see the Rory Gilmore of' The Gilmore Girls' Bledel does a nice job with her Winnie Foster. The movie strays from Babitt's novel in some ways, as the "" love "" between two central characters is romanticized slightly."
4115,"Patrick Fugit ("" Almost Famous "") offers a nice turn as the one who provides the out for Astrid. It is a complex story of the relationship between a powerless girl and a loveless mother that, in spite of its cheesy sounding premise, manages to avoid all clichÃ©d Hallmark moments and project quite a lot of heart in doing so. Ingrid Magnussen is not as perfect as she thinks, and her love is as poisonous as the white oleander. She not only looks different but her mannerisms are also so innocent and naive in the beginning. Robin Penn, Renee' Zellwegger, Michelle Pfieffer; all did outstanding!"
4116,"By far the most insightful comments in the film are made by Marilyn Manson - namely that there are certain businesses and politicians in the United States that capitalise on on fear. an incredibly overrated director who combines the crude rhetorical style of conservative media hacks like ann coulter with the nutty politics and unconvincing "" millionaire spokesman for the common man "" persona of ralph nader. anyone who honestly thinks that "" bowling for columbine "" is an accurate and thoughtful investigation of violent crime in american society does not live in the united states (as the demographic data on this website clearly illustrates) or is ideologically predisposed to agree with any crackpot theory that moore spits out. Not a love of violent movies, video games, and so forth, because other countries love all that too. ' In between telling interviews, Moore has various ways of documenting contexts: an animation, recited statistics with images, and astonishing film clips like the Fifties one of cops admiring how realistic some kids' toy guns are, and the one from a metal - detector company pushing for dress codes in schools, showing a boy with baggy pants unloading a whole arsenal."
4117,"He's got the cheers upfront because he is a celebrity, but once the initial welcome applause is gone, it's the material that counts. He is self - assured and confident - no surprises there - and is always in control. Whereas Jerry seemed very open to the audience, very approachable to everyone, Orny was in the game for the money, wealth, and power only. You can see this whenever someone talks during one of Orny's shows. He is constantly refining his material, getting heckled and trying jokes that get little laughs."
4119,"A few minutes later, a truck flies by, again very abrasively, and drops a harmonium in front of Adam Sandler. Until Adam's life begins to flourish: then you get pretty sounds, pretty colors--as the viewer, you're let off the hook, too. The deal is getting free frequent - flyer miles due to a deal the company has on all of their items. People who liked PT Anderson's other movies might find it too pretensious. Just don't expect a happy, hilarious Happy Gilmore."
4120,"Madonna plays a rich, pretentious, nit - witted Gorgon who goes on vacation with her henpecked husband and flippant friends (the brunette woman is as bad as Madonna, exhibiting some really dumb facial expressions). After nearly 20 years of trying to become a respected actress (or "" octress "" as she might have pronounced it in "" The Next Best Thing ""), she still can't get out of herself long enough to turn in a performance that anyone with taste could even call decent. The "" funny "" scenes were merely embarrassing. For years Madonna has tried to prove not only herself, but the public eye, that she can act."
4121,"The flashbacks are backed by a very moody score and a sense of realism that make for really good scenes. A rich bohemian artist - type, the charismatic Mr. Hunnam disappeared two years ago. Katie Holmes' performance is the core of the narrative but fine production qualities, direction, and attention to details are also important. The performances, cinematography, and music are all great but it just can't seem to find a solid direction. The use of beautifully lit backgrounds and scenery paint a perfect portrait for the flashback scenes and his use of dark blues and muddy greens provide set the mood for the darker themes of the story."
4123,"These last years, apart from the rendering of popular comic strips and the adaptation of TV series for the big screen, American cinema feels a vivacious interest for Oriental culture, especially the Japanese one. "" Mousehunt "" (1997) was a formulaic but enjoyable comedy but "" the Mexican "" (2001) was a lame movie. The starting point promises great things and Verbinski will deliver them throughout his flick. What distinguishes "" the Ring "" from other horror stuff of these last years is that there's a solid scenario which holds water until the very last minutes of Rachel's adventure and shelves quite an important number of formulaic ingredients. It is well - crafted and set with clockwork precision for the schedule of spooky moments."
4124,"Greg Kinnear's Bob Crane joins the likes of DeNiro's Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull, Gene Hackman's Harry Caul in The Conversation, and Nick Nolte's Wade Whitehouse in another Schrader masterpiece, Affliction. Kinnear and Dafoe's performances alone are worth the price of admission. Not content to go over the top and yell at the top of his lungs to be effective, Kinnear instead puts on a fake smile and charms with a velvety voice while openly degrading and hitting on women. The effect is one of the most genuinely creepy performances ever committed to film. The story of Crane, the one that makes him a subject of a major motion picture of his life, are two things: 1 - the good - guy TV hero was, behind the scenes, a huge sex addict; 2 - he was murdered, with no one ever convicted of the crime."
4126,"Naqoyqatsi seems to delight in pummeling the viewer with shot after out of focused, highly contrasted, digitally altered shot of the continued plagues of the world. Rarely has a film so spectacularly failed to live up to its predecessors and lost its way. When representing "" sport as war "" the prominent team logos ensured that the USA was depicted as the winner. The gallery of faces (waxworks) gave only a nod to the existence of important personages outside of the USA. Enhanced by the haunting music of Philip Glass, ` Naqoyqatsi' offers a dazzling kaleidoscopic view of the world, a visual tour de force for the aesthetically inclined."
4127,"Naturally beautiful and full - bodied actress America Ferrera plays Ana, a Mexican American whose graduation and scholarship to Columbia University threaten the family's unity and the control by her mother, who tells stories of runaway girls with disastrous ends and the admonition, ` That's what happens to girls who don't listen to their mothers. A coming of age story in which Ana (America Ferrera) deals with the effects of tradition, gender, social class and race on her future and on her family. The cinematic gaze on Ana is that she is a healthy sized Latin woman with curves and intelligence coming from a lower class family. Real Women Have Curves is a very enjoyable film, and also a very real film. The main character is of the Hispanic persuasion and though she is a very bright girl and could possibly get into a good collage she runs the risk of being swallowed up in the death trap job of making dresses that cost them 18 dollars to make but get sold in department stores for 800 dollars."
4128,"It is ironic, and strangely fitting, therefore, that it should be the Russians who, almost a full century later, have now produced the first full - length feature film ever to be composed of a single unedited shot running uninterrupted from first moment to last (Hitchcock came close with ` Rope,' but he did include a few ` cuts' in the course of the film). It's truly amazing to see just how beautifully planned and flawlessly executed the final product turns out to be, especially the ball sequence at the end which features hundreds of dancers and spectators who are set in beautifully choreographed and constantly whirling motion. What's most remarkable is how much of a participant the camera itself is in the proceedings. Not content to stand idly by and observe the scene like some passive onlooker, the camera moves right into the center of the action, gliding in and out of the crowds with utmost grace and precision. Visually, the film is stunning, with exquisite costumes and furnishings as far as the eye can see."
4188,"What was here was a good little comedy movie that poked fun at a lot of Canadian idiosyncrasies, had realistic characters and had a bit of fun with a known Canadian (and international) sport. The acting, particularly by the 3 leads, was good for the most part. Even the many colourful characters, including bit - parts, are very believable in today's small - town culture. If you just want a pizza and beer movie and a few laughs with mates then this is a good choice. All in all it shines for its small town values, it's heart, and good performances."
4165,"There is a bit of inspiration here, but just as much that's stolen from other better horror movies. As far as the cast is concerned, there are two surprises. The lighting effects with the light reflecting off the water, the dripping sounds and the sound track were all amazing. It wasn't brilliant, but the special effects were beautiful and the sets were magnificent. One last thing, if the movies that come out of the "" Dark Castle "" production company keep on gaining in quality, maybe will they create a masterpiece one day."
4166,"Basically it is "" Candid Camera "" meets the X-Games meets drunkards. The humor is very selective - some will hate it and others (mainly stoned teens) will love it. One of the best gags involves about four men on a golf course blasting air horns during tee - offs. This film is definitely going to gross - out certain people, and enthuse the more wacky crowds out there. Some of the ` stunts' are clever and amusing, and there is a certain anarchic kick to be derived from seeing these guys pushing back the boundaries of conventional common sense and good taste."
4167,"Enhanced by the dashing beauty and charisma of its two stars, Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant, the sophisticated wit of its ingenious script, the shimmering beauty of its on - location photography, and, of course, the classic strains of its Henry Mancini score, "" Charade "" is a movie that one can enjoy no matter how many times one has seen it. Although this new version shares the basic plot premise of the original, it has completely eliminated most of the elements that made ` Charade' such a world - class, timeless charmer. First of all, in what universe could Mark Wahlberg and Thandia Newton possibly be considered replacements for Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, two of the greatest screen legends of all time? Yes, Ms. Newton has a certain attractiveness and appeal at times, but her one - note expression of pouting bemusement does grow tiresome after awhile. The real trouble, however, comes with Wahlberg, a fine actor who has turned in some impressive film performances in the past, but who is just plain disastrous in this part."
4168,"Leigh has always shown that no matter how dire the circumstances, how forlorn the existence, love and hope, friendship and family, will find a way to offer support, comfort and succor. In achieving this, Leigh has the assistance of another of the U. K.'s finest - Timothy Spall. A pensive, gentle man, trapped in his own doubts and in a world of people who react by lashing out, verbally or physically and so compounding his doubts and fear."
4169,"Frida, in many ways, prides herself on her independent, fiery nature, yet when Rivera becomes a part of her life, she quickly succumbs to his seductive charms. That the relationship is one of utter co-dependency is demonstrated by the fact that Rivera, even after their numerous breakups, keeps coming back to his one true love. Director Julie Taymor keeps the political issues of the era front and center, perfectly integrating them with the tumultuous relationship at the story's core. Ashley Judd does a nice turn as one of Rivera's socialite devotees and Antonio Banderas makes his mark in his very brief appearance as David Siqueiros, a passionate socialist who accuses Rivera of kowtowing to the powers - that - be whom he claims to despise (Banderas is so good in the role that one regrets he isn't given more screen time). Taymor has had mixed results integrating Frida's works into the story."
4170,"Their two targets, Andrea (Elizabeth Berkley) and Sophie (Jennifer Beals) are terrific. As Roger, Campbell Scott does a superb job bringing out both of those seemingly contradictory qualities. In a touching scene between Nick and two women picked up at a local bar (played understatedly by Jennifer Beals and Elizabeth Berkley), it is Nick's innocence and honestly that has the women swoon over Roger's frank and demeaning manner. Isabella Rossellini, Elizabeth Berkley and Jennifer Beals also turn in outstanding performances as the various ladies who play a part in the two men's adventure. His scenes with Joyce are some of the most telling about Roger, and arguably some of his most well - acted."
4175,"However for gentle laughs based on good banter rather than set up jokes, this is a surprisingly fun comedy despite not sticking in your mind for longer than 15 minutes after you watch it. The comedy is more based on banter than anything else, so if you like the two aforementioned Chan movies then this should be enjoyable as the humour is of the same vein. No brilliant ideas, or anything like that, just the usual comic stuff. If you can with - hold your disbelief of this concept for ninety minutes his performance is fairly enjoyable. The story isn't something really new, but it has quite a few humorous plot twists."
4177,"You really have to admire Brian DePalma as a director. He's directed some of the finest thrillers in the last 30 years and even his misfires are interesting to watch like "" Snake Eyes "". Interesting films that some viewers had mixed reactions to but the direction of these films was so expertly crafted that even the most ardent critics had to admit to the talent of the director. This is a psychological thriller that has so many twists and turns that the casual film viewer will probably be in over their head. DePalma uses many overhead shots to allow the viewer to get full view of certain scenes."
4178,"The plot is not a biography of Martial Mathers, a. k. a. Eminem, but it is very much informed and guided by the experiences of his early career as a rapper in blue - collar and no - collar Detroit. Eminem gives a compelled, powerful performance that diverges just enough from his public self to inject the story with a strong sense of realism without sacrificing anything artistically. For one, 8 Mile might have the most believable, most powerful representation of an automobile factory of any film in the last twenty years, and it still manages to use the location for sophisticated, plot driving drama. In an industry where pop music movies are a dime a dozen, this is particularly impressive. The relationship between Rabbit (Eminem) and his little sister gives a perfect balance to his wild nightlife, his crappy day job and his constant battles with his mom (Kim Basinger) and her boyfriend."
4179,"Todd Haynes' Far From Heaven, a homage to the 1950s melodramas of Douglas Sirk, is an exquisitely crafted film of beauty and grace. The scenes between Moore and Haysbert crackle with erotic energy because everything remains unsaid. Cathy and Frank Whitiker may be far from heaven, but the film comes about as close to heaven as is possible. Everything for Cathy goes well until her husband starts questions his own sexually. Haysbert is terrific as Cathy's Gardener."
4180,"There are several good fight scenes and plenty of action. Hey, Half Past Dead isn't Oscar material, but if you're looking for a fun action movie it's pretty darn good. The stunt work is fine as usual, but the action scenes despite their groovy slow - mo, are completely flat and boring. C'mon Steven, you're better than this."
4181,"Like part one, "" chamber of secrets "" stays true to the book. If a book is loved by millions of readers there must be a good reason for that. So, after "" philosophers stone "" he delivered again! His broad smile and clumsiness Ã  la Frank Spencer would have been perfect for the role. The great find of the movie is Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy."
4190,"It's not for everyone and you will get intense critics decided on how people should or would react when millions disappear. This could've been a great film, because the story is there, but the film makers destroyed it. The performances are far more emotional and dramatic, and it will really tug your heart strings. Acting and dialogue are unintentionally hilarious, setting off streams and fits of laughter."
4182,"In "" The Crime of Father Amaro, "" the top film in Mexican box - office history, Carlos Carrera shows that even a man with morals and scruples betrays the nature of his profession, mostly when he brazenly criticizes the priesthood, and questions the Catholic Church's representatives on a variety of charges like illicit love affair, corruption, drug dealing, and hypocrisy. The release of the film THE CRIME OF PADRE AMARO caused about as much of an uproar in Mexico in 2002 as the publication of the novel, written by Jose Maria Eca de Queiroz, caused in 1875. At the heart of the story is a young priest who wrestles in a major way with the tempting hungers of his body and the grace - filled yearnings of his spirit. Unfortunately, his happily deluded demeanor meets with an equally intense personality in the form of Amelia, a devout young devotee acted with mesmerizing perfection by the gorgeous Ana Claudia Talancon. He in turn dares to drape her in a cape reserved for representations of the Madonna and recites to her from Solomon's "" Song of Songs "" as they seduce each other."
4183,"The interview of the assassin's ex wife, played chillingly real by Kate Williamson, is a little gem on its own and the performances, if you can call them that, are uniformly startling, embedded in that, clumsy but undeniable truth that only non professional actors are capable of. The film started out well and the performances were good - Raymond J. Barry was particularly well - suited to his role. The audience immediately feels some kind of affinity with Kobeleski, being a normal kind of guy looking for work, and at the same time immediately become intrigued by the Ex-Marine apparent third gun man, Walter Ohlinger. Interview With the Assign, although clearly distinguishable as a mockumentry as apposed to a documentary from the very beginning, accomplishes this. Filmmed digitally (SONY PD - 150) with such skill that you'll be checking your TV / DVD resolution in the first five minutes, the filmmakers use every advantage and disadvatage of the digital format to their benefit."
4184,"The live musical performances are inspired, with modern singers covering Motown classics, accompanied by the Funk Brothers themselves. All of the vocalists are superb, creatively interpreting each song, while at the same time paying respect to the style of the original recording artists. But the performances of those great songs. Steve Jordan said it best though when he said that Deputy Dog could have sung to their tracks and made hits. Unlike many "" true story "" documentaries this was a good story with a happy ending."
4191,"Neil Marshall's "" Dog Soldiers "" is actually one of the best horror movies made in 2002. Dog Soldiers is a simple story about an Army platoon on exercise in Scotland who find themselves pitched against intelligent werewolves. The script is excellent, the characters believable and the werewolves are scary. The scenes are really tense, especially certain scenes where certain soldiers attempt to brave it outside. this film has everything for the true horror fan, a great story, good acting, lots of blood, tons of action and most importantly it's bloody scary."
4210,"This franchise of movies has evolved over the years from a cool and clever spy series to an over-the-top slam bang action series. Of course it has its shortcomings (the CG was weak in parts) but it has everything that makes the franchise successful. Here the familiar is everything - in fact its the building blocks of the story (such as it is) and the characters and, well everything really. Creating new, exciting adventures for 007 after 20 feature films in forty years is a difficult task at best, particularly as public tastes change, and the character of James Bond has to maintain at least a degree of the' persona' created by Ian Fleming. For almost half a century from the old generations to the youth it is always advised that the 007 - Bond movies are the best action & thriller of all."
4211,"But, wrapped up in the sentimental moralizing, there was the story of a great man doing the only great thing left: trying to bring others out the darkness. The movie deals with a good and idealist teacher (Kevin Kline) of Roman classic history and his relationship to a roguish and rebel pupil (Emile Hirsch) in a high class prep school. Mr Hundert's dedication and enormous enthusiasm is infectiously touching. In 28 years society has changed, and it's funny to wonder if that group of boys from the 1970s ever thought that in 28 years, what they were paddling across a lake for would be right next to them. William Hundert is the most highly respected faculty member at St. Benedict's Academy."
4212,"Probably even more hilarious is the sheer sight of Katt Williams' Money Mike who plays someone that is a cross between Snoop Dogg and Spike Lee. Yes, it was funny in spots, but it was the kind of humor that debases the laugher. The third movie in Ice Cube's "" Friday "" series, this was the funniest of the three so far."
4213,"The performances were real, the direction was brilliant, and the common thread that ran through the intimate details of the women's awakenings flowed easily, despite the segmented telling of their tales. ' Personal Velocity: Three Portraits' is an engaging and different movie about the lives of three women. ' Personal Velocity: Three Portraits' is a nice and attractive independent low budget movie. The best thing about this film are the three superb performances by the lead actresses in each segment. The film is exciting too, as an example of the artistic possibilities of low budget digital film making."
4214,"The sultry and grasping humidity of the land almost comes off the screen. Their grunts and laughs at certain points reflected their views. But the story told here is a faithful mirror of what in 1952 were complex questions in a scary world made scary by communism, not the liberal democracies. Both Caine and Fraser bring a quiet intensity to their scenes together. She seems far more comfortable and believable in her scenes with Caine, despite their major age difference."
4215,"He voices several characters in the film, one of them Davey, who he also resembles, a Jewish man in his mid-thirties, deeply loathing of the holidays and all the cheer they bring to people. The film has some great laughs, the deer are great throughout the film along with Whitey's brother, Elanor (also voiced by Sandler) and will keep you laughing until the last five minutes. Even a lot of Sandler's jokes and songs on his CD's are pretty funny."
4216,"Will (Devon Sawa) is a Hollywood producer who excels at making commercials with some extreme sports fanatics on centre stage. To film such a daring and precarious commercial they need an equally adventurous cinematographer, who turns out to be Mark (Heino Ferch). It was an inoffensive movie with great stunts and lovable characters. Great original, imaginative, extreme action and fabulous stunts make this a great watch for all. So while xXx (starring Vin Diesel) was successful enough to secure a sequel, Extreme Ops failed to make an impression at the box office, and the notion of extreme sport action movies died out as quickly as it had begun."
4217,"Visually, the Solaris future is a conservative, believable vision, reminiscent in look to that of Gatacca. The sets and costumes also retain the sense of engineering realism combined with beauty. Soderbergh's eye for detail is evident here, as everything has a purpose and look that fits perfectly with the overall feel. The camera work is non-intrusive, solid stuff without gimmick (apart from a touch of shaky - cam in the restaurant scene where Kelvin meets Rheya) or overstatement. Add to this a beautiful, timeless score by Cliff Martinez and you have one of the better psychological sci - fi movies ever made."
4218,"But beyond the technical qualities, "" Treasure Planet "" captures the spirit of Disney much better than recent Disney debacles (see Valiant, Chicken Little, Home on the Range). There are plenty of funny moments, endearing moments (without being sappy), and just the right touch of suspense to keep you hanging on. The tale of a teenage boy thrust into the adventure of a lifetime features pirates, swordfights, an ocean voyage, betrayals, and buried treasure among many other classic adventure - story ingredients â€“ what's not to love? To be fair, TREASURE PLANET is not the first film to set the story among the stars; that distinction belongs to the 1987 Italian live - action TV Mini-series TREASURE ISLAND IN OUTER SPACE. Jim Hawkins of Treasure Planet does not suffer as much as his archaic counterpart, therefore his character does not under go the same heroic journey and does not emerge as profoundly changed as R. L. S original did."
4219,""" They "" definitely works better on viewers who are home alone at night. The traumatic experience, plus the meeting with two friends of Billy, Sam Burnside (Ethan Embry) and his girlfriend Terry Alba (Dagmara Dominczyk), in the funeral make Julia having nightmares again. There's a lot of potential and beautiful scenes in this movie. Opening with a scene that trades nicely on childhood fears of the dark and dark spaces, this film continues with the one idea that there are monsters out there but cannot ever get above the level of basic and rather obvious horror. As director Harmon enjoys the ominous places such as cupboards and corners and he uses them well even if he is never above having something suddenly jump out â€“ it is hardly Ring but it suits the type of film he is trying to make."
4224,"Honestly, can you think of any sequel (other than the rare "" Godfather Part II "" film) that is as good as the original in terms of reasons for being there? The movie hasn't got an interesting plot, but it should've had many funny moments. All of these movies have more charm than this one. (Harold Ramis) turns to remakes (Bedazzled - 2000), and sequels (Analyze That - 2002) after years of his "" original "" masterpiece as a writer, producer, and director (Groundhog Day - 1993). But there are some pretty funny scenes in "" Analyze That ""."
4225,"Not totally original, it could be seen as a homage to many of its predecessors, yet it delivers and keeps you interested right until the very end. Leguizamo is brilliant in the lead role and has good support from the likes of Peter Sarsgaard, as his new wall street chum, and Vincent Laresca as his best friend from childhood. Denise Richards (not really having to act here, which suits her fine) and unknown Delilah Cotto are good eye candy, and do well as the sexy female leads. Victor believes Wall Street investment banker Jack Wimmer (Peter Sarsgaard) is his lifeline to quick â€“ and legal â€“ financial freedom. The picture talks upon a dealer (John Leguizamo) with a lot of success on south Bronx who loved for his girlfriend (Dalilah Cotto) develops an economic relation with a Wall Street yuppie financier (Peter Saasgard) and his fiancÃ©e (Denise Richards)."
4226,"Spike Jonze is merciless in this regard. Akin to "" Being John Malkovich "" really. Similarly, Chris Cooper brings a humanity to the role of the Orchad Thief, really grounding the narrative and making it all believable. Again, he's given a brilliant opening scene and he works wonders with it. Amidst some cloying self - referential clap - trap, there are actually some really freshing film moments."
4227,"there are so many twists and turns, you'll be on the edge of your seat with suspense the majority of the time. The film is really great, quick action, combined with a brilliantly stated philosophical question, breathtaking scenes with lots of effects, superb actors! Just as important as dialogue for Wimmer's commentary on man's emotions are body language and behavior."
4244,A comedy well worth watching for lots of laughs. Turns out these jewelery pieces are magical and allow body - switching. The script to the Hot Chick is surprisingly good and well - organized (though it's premise is basically a raunchier riff on 80s body switch movies like vice-versa and freaky friday without any moralizing). A very popular girl named Jessica (Rachel McAdams) accidently switches body with a man who is also a criminal (Rob Schneider) because of a pair of magical earrings. Plus it had the added bonus of major babes Anna Faris and Rachel McAdams.
4243,"Drumline is a great movie--but you have to see it for what it is. not what your preconceived notions lead you to believe it might be. "" Boy meets girl / boy loses girl / boy gets girl back and learns the value of teamwork in time for the big showdown "" is a formula that has worked for years--and it works here! The actual band performances are AWESOME and will definitely be an eye - opener to anyone who has never seen this type of thing before. Equally important, the movie features strong male figures who resolve differences without resorting to pathological violence."
4245,"If you like these kinds of movies that leave you feeling good and happy about life, then you'll enjoy this tastefully done movie as well. It has strong characters of positive principles, and there's even an "" older man mentor, "" like from "" Pretty Women, "" that adds that wholesome touch to the film."
4246,"Steward and Spiner are doing a wonderful job, Tom Hardy is also good as Shinzon and Ron Perlman adds another dying character to his filmography. on a desert planet that resolves in a grin - inducing fashion, and a fast - paced shootout on board Shinzon's warship, the Scimitar, which also resolves in a pretty cool manner. That aside, this film is handsomely produced with a great production design and has some exciting conflict between Picard (Patrick Stewart) and his nemesis, Shinzon (Tom Hardy). What was noble in Spock's gesture seems, in NEMESIS, to be nothing more than an excuse to give Spiner a' big' scene, and to stir up loyal' Trek' fans, when all else had failed. After four years of reflection the producers of Star Trek finally realised that they should hire an experienced movie director and writer, one imagines in an attempt to finally give the Next Generation a chance to enjoy a truly cinematic adventure, divorced from the production methodology of the T. V series."
4247,"Everyone, simply everyone, does a great job portraying the various characters, from the hotshot newly educated young man who takes Schmidt's job, to the embarrassing buddy of Schmidt's daughter's fiancÃ©. Even if you hate Jack in all his other movies, you will love him in this one. The combination of Jack, this story and these settings is effective and compelling. For many years he has worked as an actuary at a big insurance company. He is married for forty - two years with his wife Helen (June Squibb) and he has a daughter living in Denver, Jeannie Schmidt (Hope Davis) who will marry a looser pretty soon."
4248,"It has its funny moments, but it is mostly sobering and heart - wrenching. Those who require explosions and car chases need not bother with this one, but if you enjoy an intelligent, touching human drama, you will be in for an unexpected treat. There are a lot of well - meaning friends and acquaintances. There's a kind of amiable smoothness to the events, and frequent humorous moments. This may be partly due to the guiding hand of director Bruce Beresford who has never met a dramatic situation that he couldn't make cozy, whether it was the Boer War in "" Breaker Morant, "" Southern racial tensions in "" Driving Miss Daisy, "" capital punishment in "" Last Dance "" or Japanese POW camps in "" Paradise Road, "" the latter also with J. Margulies from "" ER . """
4250,"A powerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum, he should of been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. When Treebeard and his army of Entz tear down Isengard, the destruction and the battle is so immense in size, that you truly have to see to believe. From the beginning to the very end, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is interesting and enjoyable. Although not 100% loyal to the written trilogy, the movies are done in such a way that the mainstream audience and LOTR fans from before the movies came out can say they were enjoyable and well made. The scenery is marvelous, the animations great, and the story superb."
4251,"Then you got his two friends, Frank Slaughtery (Barry Pepper) and Jakob Elinsky (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who each have to deal with the fact that their best friend is going away for seven years, but also have their own demons to deal with. In fact the entire cast is something to admire in this movie: Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Anna Paquin and Barry Pepper. Lee's trademarks are present here and the cinematography suits the feel of the movie very well. The premise here is a deeply original, inspiring and intriguing one, concerning Marty (Edward Norton) a drug dealer who is about to go to prison for seven years. Dealing with his attraction to his student, Mary (Anna Paquin)."
4252,"And his self - confidence and self affirmations to his mother and against the abusers of his past were so powerful. There are just so many issues that are brought out in this movie - and they are dealt with so well by the script and by the acting that Antwone Fisher should be a "" Best Picture "" nominee for sure. It's Denzel Washington / s debut as a director, and his film does very well in exploring the moral dilemmas and redemption of his principal character, Antwone Fisher. With every step he takes in the scenes, his presence commands the screen! Also, the heartfelt performance of the 28 year - old actor, Derek Duke, who plays the adult Antwone â€˜ Fish' Fisher, is equally awesome."
4253,"At the same time, the director attempts to portrait the whole birth and growth of the United States, in a kind of parabole, but without loosing his focus on the main story and the surrounding. New York, New York: Scorsese gets involved in something that compares to his previous work the way a fancy little sports car compares to a huge truck: A grandioso film of epic proportions and of great ambition. The verdict: A fabulous film, which is going to be recognized for such in some years Gangs of New York is just perfect entertainment. Just as important as the actors are to Gangs is the period atmosphere that drips off the screen."
4254,"She is sexy and gifted and has the perfect talent and timing to easily take over the mantle of stars like Irene Dunne, Jean Arthur, Katherine Hepburn, Doris Day and more recently Meg Ryan as a true queen of Rom - Com. An enjoyable film and one deserving pride of place on any DVD shelf. Writer and first time Director, Marc Lawrence's "" Two Weeks Notice "" is a charming, smart, and genuinely funny romantic comedy with terrific performances by Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant. In a very well done scene on the rooftop of Lucy's parent's New York apartment, Lucy shares with George that she never lived upto her mother's expectations. Sure, his movies follow the same formula, but they are just fun to watch."
4255,"This movie is great for kids, and has talented talents like Tim Curry, Lyn Redgrave, and Flea (okay so that is an odd one to add to the mix) to appease the adults. Young children will enjoy it and, while there is not much for adults in the way that Pixar delivers the goods, parents will not be bored senseless by it and may, if they are in the mood find it enjoyable if childish. The main family are funny enough with their mix of accents (love that monkey!)"
4256,"The plot is a good cop thriller in the mould of the old 70's thrillers where the lines between good / bad, right / wrong are pretty blurred. If you like this film it is worth hunting out the DVD just for the extras, Carnahan talks in detail about the reasons behind the composition of some shots and it is impressive to hear and understand his thought process. The cast are excellent, although really the film hinges on the two leads. It would be easy to just accept his performance as a ` powerhouse' but it also has sensitivity, emotion and layers to it. Support from Busta Rhymes is minor but he plays it very well, not at all like many hip hop stars who do movies to enhance their bling - bling gangsta personae."
4272,"Frank is played by Leonardo DiCaprio, and the man hot on his trail, agent Carl Hanratty, is played by Tom Hanks. A few things stand out and of course the performances are terrific. And Christopher Walken gives one of his best performances in his already interesting career. You can understand why Dicaprio admires and loves his father. Frank Abagnale Jr. is an astounding and interesting character."
4273,"The movie Lavishly well done, energetic and fun to listen to, Chicago is easily on the top 10 best musicals ever. John C. Rielly, Renee Zellwegger and Queen Latifa deserved their Oscar Nominations. Everyone deserved their Oscar Wins or nominations whomever took part in the production. 1920s Chicago comes alive in breathtaking detail. Everyone whom likes musicals or music should definitely have a listen and watch Chicago."
4274,"Starring three of today's most popular leading actresses, winner of some Golden Globe awards, based on a Pulitzer Prize winning novel, and the recipient of numerous rave reviews; it would seem to be a film that would appeal to a lot of people. The ethereal music also helps tie the three storylines together, to make it seem as if they are happening simultaneously. She has a son who shows all the signs, even then, of what he might ultimately become in life. The sure hand of the director is obviously behind her reining the excesses she likes so well. The rest of the cast is brilliant: Miranda Richardson, Tony Colette, Ed Harris, John C. Reilly, and little Jack Rovello."
4275,"John Cusack as Rothman, the avatar of an emerging German Expressionism, is excellent as he enjoys his pre-Bauhaus mansion while seeking every opportunity to steal away from his lovely and devoted wife, Nina (well - played by Molly Parker) to exercise his libido with his mistress, Liselore (a sultry and cultured young woman whose spirit is captured by Leelee Sobieski). The direction is strong and one scene in which Hitler's rants are rapidly alternated with a Jewish service is blindingly powerful. They have given him the platform he's always wanted, and with this platform Hitler begins to rail against the Jews, and those that threaten the great country that is Germany. Writer / first time Director Menno Meyjes (The Seige ` Screenplay') has crafted a compelling and challenging story. Dutch - born Director Menno Meyjes has shown an affinity for tough ethnic and cultural clash themes in his career as a screenwriter (THE COLOR PURPLE, EMPIRE OF THE SUN and THE SIEGE are among his credits)."
4276,"Charlie Hunnam is gorgeous and capable as Nicholas, and herein lies the problem. As a way to touch Dickens, this is easily the least painful and most accessible for 7th through 12th graders. In addition to Hunnam, Anne Hathaway ("" Princess Diaries ""), Jamie Bell ("" Billy Elliot ""), Nathan Lane and Alan Cumming were all excellent. A pity that the director also puts the accent mostly on the melodramatic aspects of a story which is full of delicious humor. This adaptation has it charms but check out the royal Shakespeare's Company's version for a faithful adaptation that does Dickens real justice!"
4277,"This movie doesn't judge anybody, or tries to explain anything - it shows historical events as a reflection of one man's fate, making a powerful testimony that stays with you long after the beautiful last shot and the end credits are over. He is a simple man that is doing everything in his power to stay alive. While Spielberg's rendition of German atrocities always had a slightly staged feel to augment their dramatic purpose, here they are so true to life there impact is much greater - you watch and are being reminded in horror that this things actually happened. In one of the strongest scenes, towards the end, a German officer forces the pianist to play for his life, in an episode that suddenly brings a much lighter, beautifully poetic shade to the film (this German officer will be probably compared to Schindler, although his philanthropy does not quite share the same basis). It helps that Brody is absolutely stellar at acting with his eyes, plus his body language speaks volumes; these fill in the emotional cracks, especially in scenes where Szpilman, alone and in hiding, can't speak or even move around much for fear of giving himself away."
4280,"He employs a number of visual devices that help to fragment the world in which the story takes place. This style is further enhanced by the use of slightly off - kilter camera angles, color filtering and sepia tones in some of the shots. He cleverly balances the two ` sides' of Barris' life, transitioning smoothly between those scenes revolving around his career as TV show producer and those revolving around his career as CIA operative. Moreover, Kaufman does a nice job getting inside the head of this man who is trying to fight the demons of his own past, make a name for himself in the high stakes world of network programming, cope with his own inadequacies as a person, and come to terms with the vile things he is doing in his secret life all at the same time. As Barris, Sam Rockwell gives a terrific, high - energy performance, capturing the sadness and paranoia of a man who seems to know deep down inside that his fame is probably undeserved, built as it is on mediocre ideas and a willingness to exploit the baser instincts of human nature."
4283,"You are moved by this movie because Olivier and the Dardenne expressed the purest emotions. ` Rosetta', the previous movies made by the ` brothers' - as Jean - Pierre and Luc Dardenne are referred to in Belgium - was great. Jean Pierre and Luc Dardenne, the Belgian brothers, produced a great film that it's amazing because of the simplicity in which they tell the story. The Dardenne brothers are masters of exploding the minutiae of everyday life to beautiful, poetic proportions. Olivier's bluntness and strength and the boy's eager innocence allow truths to come out quickly."
4304,"Later, in the birthday party of Lexi (Marisa Tomei) in the wealthy house of her parents, he pretends to be a guru, and becomes very successful as the Guru of Sex, using the advice of Sharonna. The Guru is very light entertainment, but it delivers by offering nothing more than a few laughs and musical numbers that will have your feet tapping the floor. An homage to Bollywood, "" Grease "" and possibly Dr. Ruth, "" The Guru "" could be listed prominently in a cinematic encyclopedia under the heading of' cute cute cute'. Like in the Indian movies of Bollywood, there are lots of songs and numbers of dances, and the cast is very nice and enjoyable. This silly and delightful story is a great homage to Bollywood and a very good entertainment."
4305,"Gilliam's previous successes (` The Fisher King,' ` 12 Monkeys') were good enough for him to round up $30 million for this film (half of what was really needed), yet the ghost of ` Munchausen' seems to visit every scene: If Gilliam is not talking about its flaws, everyone else seems to be referencing it as the disasters pile up in pre-production and mount during the first week of production. It is a depressing last twenty minutes of film, but it is still fascinating how it becomes clear that the production will not go on. No one who loves film should miss this inside story of a gifted director pursuing a losing cause just as his fictional subject fought windmills 400 years ago (or Welles a quarter a century ago). That The Man Who Killed Don Quixote was (err, is, so to speak) a Gilliam film, the artistic desires are bold and visionary, and a challenge in and of itself. Then one learns at what lengths he had to go through to get the film made, on his third try in ten years (no money in America sent him to Europe, where his budget of 32 million was tremendous for European standards)."
4306,"May is simply one of the greatest horror films from last years. Everything is perfect until these people turn their back on May, and well that's when the fun begins. those exceptional films that are not for everyone, that manage to be both creepy and gory at the same time, in a way that's not quite easily classifiable, and so they are never considered "" mainstream "" by mass audiences in the multiplexes, or critics into selling sound - bites rather than writing decent reviews. He has crafted a fascinating look into the eyes of a crazy person, by doing what few films can. If it's anything as wonderful as "" May, "" then it should be great."
4343,"Two college - aged men who refer to each other as "" Gerry "" (Casey Affleck and Matt Damon) venture into the desert for a carefree, fun adventure, seemingly oblivious to the dangers that such an environment may conceal. "" Gerry "" thus has qualities that make it rather Zen - like. And those forbidding landscapes are hauntingly beautiful. The desert landscapes are impressive and really well captured â€“ what a shame that you do not go to the cinema just to stare at landscapes."
4344,"This "" thriller lite "" tells of innocence and victimization, and relies as much on its structural twists as on Audrey Tautou's saucer eyes and Samuel Le Bihan's hunkiness. Audrey Tautou is so charming and capable as an actress that she makes you root for her even when you know she's playing someone completely crazy. Add in the American know - how of creepiness from "" Fatal Attraction "" and "" One Hour Photo, "" and the French writer / director Laetitia Colombani, mais oui, applies it all to matters of the heart. This is one of those mixed genre movies that actually works! Both script and film are cleverly written though made by a script - writer and director (Laetitia Colombani) only at her second film."
4352,"Add in a taut script, a seasoned round of pros (Brendan Gleeson, Ving Rhames) and a fairly good performance from newcomer Scott Speedman and you have a solid, highly watchable drama. This was a well crafted cop flick where everyone seems to have dirt on someone else, and meanwhile, there are crimes being committed, and L. A. is about to erupt in rioting. The whole background story with the lawsuit against the cops who beat up Afro - American Rodney King is cleverly used to stage the 90's setting. This is not a typical character for Kurt Russell, and it's one of his best films from the past 10 years. Kurt Russel and Scott Speedman star in this this thriller about an elderly cop, named Eldon (Russel) who is corrupt, yet thinks what he does is for the greater good."
4356,"It seems those few critics and IMDB (and Amazon) reviewers who criticized it--occasionally while still giving it a favorable mark--are intent on complaining about what the movie ISN'T rather than what it is. Complaints that some many interviews don't move him towards the goal of finding Dow Mossman miss the point that the interviews are themselves interesting conversations about the love of good books. Visiting Sealy (the NY Times reviewer who inspired him to read the book) doesn't solve anything--but who wouldn't want to hang around with him a couple of days discussing great reads? Love of books permeates everything here, most poignantly and surprisingly in the clearly emotional response the agent Carl Brandt has to being reminded of what he considers a great book and reflecting on a missed career. He learns that the author, Dow Mossman, attended the Iowa Writer's Workshop with several well received writers, and he interviews the professors and classmates."
4357,"His ability to create a wholly original feel in film incomparable to any of his contemporaries is always welcomed by this viewer. The novel that is based on, must have a lot of Freud psyche theories, because the film just reflects it. It is a brilliant exploration of the Unconscious, of The Edipus Complex, and of Guilt."
4362,"It took a good fifteen minutes of footage before there was an edit or a line of dialogue that made any sense, and it took another 30 minutes before the ham - fisted script gave way to a working plot that wasn't contingent on a close - up of Ryan Gosling's smile or contrived moralizing. The highlights certainly include both Gosling and Morse's acting, Gosling being an up - and - coming star, and Morse being an extremely well - established character actor with a good feel for disparate emotions. The scene in the hospital at the end of the movie when Gid takes Roy's hand and places it on his forehead was very moving. Not that this has to do totally with sports, it is more about male relationships, as Roy, the lead character deals with the death of his father through his participation in six - man football. In The Slaughter Rule as well as other recent offerings like L. I. E. or Priest or Taboo (originally Gohatto), characters reveal emotions that seem designed specifically to break new ground in the amorphic area between ordinary storytelling and what some would call pornography."
4363,"The performances of these two characters was nothing short of amazing. The boy in particular, with every eye - twitch, frown, smile, and outburst was able to convey a frighteningly realistic portrayal of a boy who is all at once obstinate, angry, disrespectful, and immature, yet still sweet and somewhat an innocent victim of the situation. Here, it is so profound that even a pre-teen lectures his mother on right and wrong. It is simply amazing the first sequence (number 10) with fifteen minutes of dialogs between the lead character and her son without any cut. Last but not the least, the remarkable beauty of the face of the driver (Mania Akbari) is awesome: she is exotic for Brazilian standards, but really a very beautiful woman."
4366,"In this film, currently playing only the arthouse theaters, Christian Bale brings his fiance (Kate Beckinsale) to L. A. to live in his mom's house temporarily while they try to find their own place. His mom however, is a free spirited record producer prone to wild parties and doping. the film just kindof ends without a resolution. ` Laurel Canyon' is an intriguing character - driven drama, written and directed by Lisa Cholodenko and featuring first - rate performances by Frances McDormand, Christian Bale, Kate Beckinsale, Alessandro Nivola and Natascha McElhone. Praise must also be given to Bekinsale (` Pearl Harbor') and Nivola (` Jurassic Park 3') for their exceptional performances."
4368,"This film trots along nicely at a lovely pace, never dwelling on anything longer than necessary nor leaving anything unfinished, keeping the viewer entertained and mentally engaged. ` Bend It Like Beckam' is a heartwarming charmer about a young girl's search for identity in 21st Century England. Like ` Fiddler on the Roof,' ` Beckam' deals with the painful struggles tradition - bound cultures must go through as they enter a looser, more freedom - loving modern world. The culture in this case is that of immigrant and first - generation Indians living in Great Britain. She receives superb support from a cast of outstanding actors, both young and old, including Keira Knightley as Jules, her inspirational buddy who provides Jess with the opportunity to bring her dreams to fruition; Jonathan Rhys - Meyers as Joe, the handsome young coach who provides lessons in love along with lessons in soccer; Anupam Kher as Jess' father, who turns out to have some of his own personal demons to deal with; Shaheen Khan as Jess' mother, who doesn't understand why her daughter can't be content with the pre-ordained life her parents have laid out for her; and Juliet Stevenson as Jules' mother, who proves that Indians don't hold a patent on tradition - obsessed parents."
4389,"In that respect it's not unlike "" Deuce Bigalow, Male Gigolo "", or some of the more risquÃ© Benny Hill skits: sure it's stupid, vulgar and corny, but sometimes exactly those kinds of comedies can fill a comedy niche with certain viewers. Two scenes of unbelievable stupidity are worth mentioning."
4400,"The movie starts off in ` Ugly Fat' Donna's bedroom where Victor is sure to seduce her, but a cry from outside disrupts his plans when his best - friend Harold (Kevin Rivera) comes - a-looking for him. Throughout the film you get to know certain characters like Vicky, Nino, Grandma, Judy and even Judy's best friend Melonie. But Raising Victor Vargas is only Sollett's second film, and his most well known, a solid effort in filmmaking that will hopefully get better as he continues to make films. A few years ago seeing an "" independent "" film meant that you would likely be treated to some originality and a lot of energy and care, and maybe a few technical glitches caused by the low budgets, nowadays, it means that chances are you'll get yet another by - the - numbers, let's - shake - the - camera - around - for - two - hours attempt at placating the lack of taste of independent distributors."
4401,"This superb film lays a lot of truths about humanity pitilessly bare. As a documentarian, Steve James has a lot to learn, especially about editing. The scene where Stevie goes back to visit his foster parents reveals a different side of his personality that springs from somewhere deep inside him as though it had been locked away for years. The moment his mother hugs him after he goes into prison is something she should have done many years ago, perhaps when he was a young boy instead of hitting him in the face."
4404,"The requisite drying - out scenes, where Bob handcuffs himself to the bed and rejects Anne's offer of sexual freedom, are effective realism in an otherwise stylish film that eschews clarity and ingenuity in favor of some character development and much atmosphere. Bob as a "" good thief "" is all that matters. More than a heist film, with an interesting young cast and a terrific conclusion at the gambling tables, with Nick Nolte playing a heroin addicted compulsive gambler and all around nice guy who goes cold turkey in order to get in shape for the heist of a super swank Monte Carlo casino vault and priceless paintings. The cast makes this film, especially Nutsa Kukhianidze as Anne and Said Taghmaoui as Paulo, whose interaction take the film in an even more interesting direction, while the addition of identical twins (the Polish brothers) was a stroke of genius. A heist movie that oozes style, particularly in the form of Nick Nolte, gangster, part - time heroin addict (he handcuffs himself to the bed to go cold turkey before a job) and good guy."
4405,"Sutherland plays' The Caller', manning a high profile sniper rifle, while he thrusts honesty upon Stu Shephard (Colin Farrell). Fabulous entertainment and a good display of creativity. Pray that the darkest force that dials your number is a telemarketer. Thanks to Farrell's performance it makes for good mainstream cinema (normally an oxymoron) and may actually make a few top ten lists."
3616,"accidentally foil a hit on Stanley Tucci (hilariously obnoxious as Russo's dreadful second husband) by Jack Kehler and Dennis Farina (spoofing his earlier role in Sonnenfeld's GET SHORTY adaptation). C'mon, give this unfairly underappreciated gem a chance when it hits home video! Big Trouble all but exceeds Dave Barry's hilarious book, with director Barry Sonnefeld getting back into the drivers seat of comical movies delivering a hit here. The acting jobs really pull this off, with great in character performances from Sizemore, Knoxville, Allen, Russo, and the two Hitmen in the film. the second sploy of this film that is more than enjoyable is the comical askew view of Florida."
4409,"The great acting of the 15 year old Russian actress Oksana Akinsjina makes it possible. He has a moving respect for Oksana and the way he cares about her integrity is the thing that makes this movie worth looking. Lukas has the gift of finding the right persons for the characters in all is movies, and Lilja 4 - ever is not an exception. Last Monday Lilja forever won 5 out of 6 gold beagles (the most important Swedish film award) it was nominated to (Artiom was also nominated for best performance by an actor). Based on actual, turn - of - the - 21st - century suicides of escaped post-Soviet child prostitutes in the suburbs of Sweden, Lilja 4 - ever is a well - done drama, featuring terrific acting--especially by Oksana Akinshina and Artyom Bogucharsky."
4420,"Their suits at Reprise balked at this sea - change and eventually refused to release the record and booted the band from the label. It's nice to see the band triumph in the end, and the film does throw some light on the pressure that is undergone to make a record for a major label as well as showing some of the seedier sides of the music business as flaks on both sides beat their chest and trumpet their side of the story. The commentary on the DVD was surprisingly funny as well. This documentary comes as a nice surprise to anyone who has been following the Uncle Tupelo / Sun Volt / Wilco chapter of rock n' roll history being quietly written in the Midwest for the past 15 years. Finally the filmmakers do a real service to music fans by including generous amounts of footage of the band at work in the studio writing, rehearsing, recording and mixing songs."
4430,""" Spellbound "" is the acclaimed documentary that follows four young contestants in the 72nd Annual National Spelling Bee. Spellbound is a surprisingly moving film, because it is not really about spelling, but about hopes and dreams. The film does a good job of showing the backgrounds of the kids and presenting their personalities. But, all in all, "" Spellbound "" is a great documentary which doesn't belittle its subject, but gives it its fullest attention - the product is a tense, funny and dramatic film about kids bonding over a common obsession, while aggressively competing. Yet, for all their seeming ` nerdness' and gift for articulation, Blitz makes it clear that these kids are really just kids (albeit highly gifted ones) after all."
4433,"The political dimension of the story is fascinating, but the main source of conflict is the interior world of Rejas, a sensitive, morally decent man who is torn between his faith in the law and his sympathy for the people who suffer at the hands of corrupt government officials. Javier Bardem plays Augustin Rejas, a former lawyer turned policeman who manages rare dignity and honesty as he battles with the interventions of a regime teetering on the edge of a military dictatorship and the pursuit of a fanatical revolutionary codenamed Ezekiel, while struggling with the varying emotions associated with a vapid wife, an adoring daughter, and his daughter's dance teacher, the eponymous and allurring woman upstairs (Laura Morante as Yolanda). Bardem, like Malkovich, is a wonderfully versatile actor, and this film offers him another fine opportunity to display his range as Rejas, an idealistic police detective who abandoned a promising career as a trial lawyer in the hope that he might be able to work within the system to heal the corruption of his native country (left unnamed, though the story clearly borrows from actual events in Peru). In a superbly controlled performance, Bardem emphasizes the vulnerability of this disenchanted, seen - it - all cop thrown against his will into the frying - pan and the way he attempts to maintain his dignity and uphold the law he no longer believes in. Bardem gets good support from some of the other actors such as Juan Diego Botto who plays his sidekick Sucre and Laura Morante as Yolanda the enigmatic ballet teacher he becomes involved with."
4436,"It tells the story of a chance encounter and ensuing friendship between Milan, a gangster who is coming to a small French town to rob a bank and Manesquier, a retired professor of poetry who has lived there his whole life. The movie is extremely well directed and photographed, with grainy blueish colors that support each character's melancholy. In one of the best scenes of the movie, the elegant poetry professor Manesquier puts on Milan's leather jacket and stands in front of the mirror saying in English: "" The name is Earp. But in the end, what makes the movie such a gem is the talent of the two lead actors who, like their characters, are such extreme opposites that their screen relationship could easily have ended up devoid of any chemestry. He has such presence and charisma that you can't take your eyes off him whenever he appears on the screen."
4438,"These qualities make The Trip a wonderfully balanced film with both genuinely funny moments along with many warm, heart - teasing scenes too, particularly because the characters are so constantly involving, as is the superbly written storyline. To portray a Republican with as much heart and vulnerability as Alan displays is no small accomplishment, and Larry Sullivan does this with commanding skill. It's rare that a director displays such talent and skill in a film while, at the same time and in equal parts, shows such joy and love for his craft. Only a truly talented director could accomplish this, making his hard work appear so effortless, resulting in the most fun an audience has had in years. And to any distributors that may read this - please take notice of this movie."
4449,"The filmmakers, who stated at the q & a post-screening that they were independently filming Jack when they joined forces on this single project, miss a great opportunity to really dig into the subject - the Golden Age of movie culture in New York, which existed back in the '50s, '60s and '70s. Pioneering figures like Anthology Archives' Jonas Mekas are still on the scene and could have been interviewed, and a study of the days of Amos Vogel, Sid Geffen, Richard Roud, Andy Warhol, et al would have made for a riveting documentary even if the "" documents plus voices "" approach of Ken Burns were all that could be conjured up of the past. The five very interesting individuals are trailed around town during 2000/2001 in lame cinÃ©ma vÃ©ritÃ© style, revealing more silly foibles than insight. Even drive - ins were a great source in "" them days "", right up through the '70s. CINEMANIA is a film for its subject matter: film geeks."
4452,"A great movie made even better on DVD. But, if you ever really liked to listen to a TMBG album, come back into the fold, and watch "" Gigantic "" No TMBG fan should go without seeing this movie, and fans of good rock documentaries will equally enjoy the great concert footage and musical interludes. On the other hand, for those with higher linguistic skills who appreciate puns and other plays on words, this will be a wonderful introduction to an amazingly talented band which has delighted fans for the last twenty years with a sly and sharp sense of the absurd. As a documentary, it isn't so hot, but given it was A. J. Schnack's first ever feature film, he did a decent job."
4459,"Having visited New Zealand, but not being very familiar with the Maori culture, this film was a refreshing way to learn some aspects of it. The girl, Pai, will grow to be an enchanting girl who will be excluded from the teachings of her grandfather Koro. Basically, it is a simple story very well told with a great performance by the child actress Keisha Castle - Hughes. The grandparents are very well portrayed by Rawiri Paratene and Vicky Houghton. This is a film for all ages to enjoy."
4513,"Like most great masterpieces of their time, 28 Days Later has been misunderstood by a considerable amount of people. They have been listening to scattered transmissions that are indicating Manchester holds a possible refuge for survivors. Every person, even the harshest critic of zombie horror movies should watch this. Jim soon finds a few other survivors, including Selena (Naomie Harris) and a father and his daughter (Brendan Gleeson and Megan Burns) who hear of salvation on a radio and decide to brave it out to find it. Mark Tildesley's production design, as well as John Murphy's music, evokes haunting, evocative moods even in the more mundane scenes."
3765,"These two young actors have wonderful moments, and they play it straight. It's a pretty straightforward teen movie with a realistic plot and great performances. Comedy stars like Catherine O'Hara, Chevy Chase, Garry Marshall, all put it nice small pieces, but it is Jack Black who owns most of the funniest moments in the film. His mere presence in a scene can make it funny; often he brings out laughs with a look or a eyebrow twitch. The movie has its share of ridiculous, over-the-top gags (A dean of admissions high on ecstasy, for example), but it's far more interested in its characters than its jokes, a refreshing change of pace for this type of movie."
4539,"Much buzz, fortunately all merited, preceded it: an amazing Nigerian actor, Chiwetel Ejiofor, already acclaimed for his stage performances, makes his big - screen debut, while Audrey Tatou, the impossibly wide - eyed kook from 2001's ` Amelie', tackles her first English - language movie role. Each character makes more compromises and greater sacrifices, all for freedom, which as the tagline of the film sums up, comes at a price. Okwe, the cause of her problems, feels duty - bound to see that she remains safe. It is subtle, entertaining, excels with its dark humor, and is an accurate portrayal of what immigrants suffer - not only in London, but around the globe. The revelation in this picture is Chiwetel Ejiofor, who is just brilliant as Okwe, the illegal immigrant at the center of the story."
8325,"was not detrimental at all, because it's not about the story told in words, anyway, but about telling it in "" thousand times "" more descriptive pictures, worming up the feelings, playfulness and imagination omnipresent in children, and, though seemingly forgotten, eventually only suppressed in grown - ups, ergo dormant potential that can be easily activated through the well - administered incentive from the skillful wake - up caller. Film offers many favourable ingredients contained in Miyazaki's other, mainly hand - drawn animated adventures: humorous, colourful characters, including child (ren), often girl (s) protagonist (s), character driven animation, subtlety in timing and movements, enchanting visuals with watercolour - like backgrounds, actions involving flying. Spacious hardly enough to accommodate solely little Mei, Koneko basu takes her on a night ride, and flies her in and out of the forest to get her acquainted with the whole fleet of cat - shaped and spirited vehicles, serving their Totoro passengers, to meet sort of a big cat - liner, Neko BÃ¢ - chan (Granny Cat Bus), and revisit the great O - Totoro itself, largest among the spirits "" keepers of the forest ""."
3778,"The extra attention and energy given to the inherent goofs and inconsistencies in the original movie ("" Tiger And Crane Fists "", Hong Kong, 1976) are priceless. However, many * do * work and provide belly laughs. One thing the movie makes particularly good use of is special effects, with some more than decent CG animation complimenting a number of scenes. As The Chosen One, Oedekerk seems to have a great time. They are the funniest men in the film industry today."
3779,"Cuba Gooding Jr. tries hard, but his comical skills are not up to par and he's nowhere near enough to bring it back to respectability. Wonderful scenery, beautiful dogs, & good acting, especially by Cuba Gooding, Jr. . With parents and brother and friends who were around 25 yrs old and niece 10 yrs old and they liked it. Plus it was great to see Uhuru from Star Trek cast as Mrs. Brooks. There are also solid support from grizzled screen veteran James Coburn and the ever - elegant Nichelle Nichols of "" Star Trek "" fame."
4553,"Through the fine acting of the cast the complexity of relationships and the nature of choices become engrossing. The end credits report that some 30, 000 women were involuntarily placed in Magdalene asylums until the last one closed in 1996. Their life after the asylum is reported in the end credits. English judges for centuries have often used a word rarely found in American case law to describe persons and events: the word is wicked. The documentary records the recollections of four Irish women who spent their youth and a good proportion of their adult lives as involuntary guests of uncompromising Roman Catholic nuns."
4554,"All appearances point out to the fact that his dentist wife, has found someone that satisfies her more than the good husband. She has her own practice as a dentist; she is a full fledged mother with three little girls that are showing signs of collective neurosis at a very early age in life, and she is an member of the chorus of the local opera company, which consumes all the free time she has. Campbell Scott is an actor whose face registers all the emotions this David Hurst is feeling without much effort. The three little Hurst girls are fine as the daughters of Dave and Dana and Dennis Leary is excellent as Dave's conscience in a very subtle role that he makes it his own. THE SECRET LIFE OF DENTISTS (2003) *** 1/2 Campbell Scott, Hope Davis, Denis Leary, Robin Tunney, Gianna Beleno, Cassidy Hinkle, Lydia Jordan."
3792,"That was cleared up, and the rest was just enjoying the scenery and performances. Five years from now, ask anyone what the best picture of 2001 was and not many people will recall with reverance what films came out in 2001. The late Richard Harris is very bold in one of his final performances and Luis Guzman is perfect as Monte Cristos right - hand man. Queue languishment in prison where he plots his escape and his ultimate revenge on Dantes in a highly fashionable style. His best friend Fernan (Pearce) secretly craves the hand of Dantes's gorgeous fiancee Mercedes (Dominczyk), so he informs to the authorities that Dantes is a conspirator plotting to aid in Napoleon's escape from Elba."
5724,"Besides the obvious rerun of old tricks, some of the new material is actually quite interesting and well - thought of. If you have already seen the American re-make of The Grudge with Sarah Michelle Geller then there's a good chance that this follow up to the Japanese original will come as something of shock. If you have a pure affection for scary scenes you may find this movie pretty enjoyable. When you finally pick up the courage to turn around and look, you realise your mind has been playing tricks on you, but the thrill was still heart - stopping regardless. The scares were more scarier, there were more scares, tenser scenes, a LOT better acting, a much better story, and a more solid plot."
5913,"It shreds the neo horror film ideology that THE RING and Sixth Sense seemed to invent and instead grabs a hold of your intestines and squeezes and then twists. This is a film made by a director that grew up perhaps admiring some of the greats from three decades ago. Switchblade Romance also features one of the best uses of original music of recent years, with a great scene that incorporates Muse's "" New Born "". A return to the bleak intensity of 1970's / 80's horror by a director (Alexandre Aja) clearly in love with the genre."
6008,"Like in any play, texts are delivered that you will not easily hear in everyday life (nobody makes up' Antebellum Insufficiently Developed Sexorgans' as an alternative interpretation of AIDS during a split second in mid-conversation). Its texts are wonderfully written, unafraid of pathos, farce and intellectualism alike, and fiercely direct in their expression. Just like art, this ambitious miniseries dares the viewer to have an opinion on the various subjects brought up by screenwriter / playwright Tony Kuchner. There were the great performances by Al Pacino, Meryl Streep, Justin Kirk, and Jeffrey Wright and the good performances by Emma Thompson, Mary - Louise Parker, Patrick Wright and, in a small role, James Cromwell. (Update: The miniseries received 21 Emmy nominations and won a record (for miniseries) 11 Emmys."
7723,"The message is sung and the rhyming in the lyrics is just tremendous, really enjoyable. ' Boundin"" is not as good or funny as Pixar's' For the Birds' or' Mike's New Car', but it is charming in its own little way. A jackalope hops along and explains to the sheep he can still be proud, all he has to do is bounce and not care about other opinions. See it for for entertaining minutes. At any rate, the movie received something of a lukewarm reception from viewers, who either loved it or hated it or wanted to love it but thought that the sheep wasn't cute enough or something."
6025,"It just fits (it is a movie about making pornos). To summarise it was one of the good comedies around there â€“ and if you enjoy movies such as "" American Pie "" you will enjoy this one as well. It is mildly entertaining at the very most and does not come close to other teenage or high school movies. Erik Von Detten, Tony Denman and Daniel Farber who played the three main characters give impressive performances as three high school geeks who decide to make their own porno movie. See it if you enjoyed the movies Road Trip or Eurotrip."
7222,"Humor is a very subjective thing, but if you liked him in the Office you will probably like this DVD. Whats best about Gervais' style is the little under the breath one - liners that pop in from time to time. There are many moments where people will just say "" He's being David Brent "" but it's just the way the guy is and technically he is David Brent! There are many memorable and unique gags, some jokes which have links to the office and there is a video clip shown to the audience where he gets a very respectable offer from his female ex boss. Not everything in life is all cute and cuddly and neither is it in comedy."
6066,"Instead of (like most Swedish comedies) putting someone through purely embarrassing moments and believing that everyone finds that funny, this movie relies on surprising twists and turns and a witty funny dialogue. Erik returns home when he finds out that his sister Sussie is missing. This enables the movie to take very surprising and funny twists. But "" Smala Sussie "" ("" Slim Sussie "" in English) is funny in more ways than being a hillbilly comedy. The acting by young BjÃ¶rn Starrin, Jonas Rimeika and Tuva Novotny is great."
7159,"Because while The Room is the worst movie ever made it is also the greatest way to spend a blisteringly fast 100 minutes in the dark. as Johnny and Lisa roll around the bed in a pre-intercourse ritual revolving around rose petals, you know you are in for a very special movie. Let's first discuss Mr. Wiseau's expert crafting of dramatic tension. The best part of the movie is Mr. Wiseau's acting. ' On the musical front, the shifting from a mysterious moody orchestral score to straight - up R&B ably shows Mr. Wiseau's ability to blend different styles musically in order to create a unified mood in his movie."
4626,"Frances adapts to the house and the locals with remarkable aplomb. Her facial gestures, mirroring her emotions as they shift from moment to moment, are the product of extraordinary acting ability. Obvious in its attempts to tug at the heart - strings of romantics with all the expected Italian stereotypes and cliches, this flick received mixed reviews and will resonate most with more mature sentimentalists. While not exactly the detailed travelogue that Mayes' book is, this version of "" Under the Tuscan Sun "" really captures the magic of the Italian region and accurately shows off bits of the country's culture despite the funny use of classic stereotypes. True, it's story may not be the most original one, but the way it's executed it's strangely charming, as if the beautiful cinematography and witty script were able to cast a magic spell on the viewers and simply captivate with their simple beauty."
4281,"Go figure JEFF FOXWORTHY - Foxworthy is now a guilty pleasure. His shows uses what appear to be real demons from his past to make you laugh, and laugh you will. Movies are all about inventing lives, so those niches are now defined by comics and routines that are all about helping the audience decide who they are. His stand - up is better than Engvall & LTCG, but the whole bit is nothing new. Their intellectual commenting, unexpected twists, playful teasing and the in - between - the - stand - up - sequences make this mix of stand - up styles work as a perfect cocktail; Ron, as the whiskey - drinking loud - mouth with an almost scary instinct for fast remarks and extremely intelligent commenting."
6144,"There, he meets Lisbela (DÃ©bora Falabella), the daughter of Tenente Guedes (AndrÃ© Mattos) and a romantic film lover, who is engaged of Douglas (Bruno Garcia) and is going to get married with him, and, like in a movie with happy end, they fall in love for each other. "" Lisbela e o Prisioneiro "" is a delightful romantic comedy, supported by funny characters, situations, expressions and sayings very typical in the country of Brazil. Lisbela e o Prisioneiro is an example of this growth. It is a hilarious "" northeastern "" comedy, with great performances from Selton Mello and Debora Falabella. The script also helped the actors in their performances, which is full of very funny lines."
4282,"There wasn't anything really amazing about this movie. As a means of silly entertainment, it's sweet, good - natured and occasionally funny, even if all the gags are recycled from other flicks. Kutcher and Murphy do have a strong screen chemistry, and this movie does have a decent script with some funny moments, it just doesn't do anything new, which leaves it feeling just a little too familiar, to be considered a really good film. WHY she actually loves her husband is unclear, just as it's unclear why newlyweds poor guy Tom (Ashton Kutcher) and rich girl Sarah (Brittany Murphy) team up. Brittany Murphy and Ashton Kutcher were great together, they made a really good pair."
4284,"So there you go, this is a mildly - entertaining, not clever or witty, but "" ok - time killer "" for those who enjoy regular almost mediocre romantic comedies. However it is funny enough to cover the cracks. He is a good lead here and keeps bits of his ` Brody' from Mallrats to good effect. Even if most of the funniest lines and situations involved toilets, STDs, or pornography. There were plenty of good acting performances, considering the material."
4285,"Better than most Adam Sandler movies and minus all the language and sexual content that Sandler and others seem to sneak into movies they try and sell to "" kids "". This is a typical O'Connell role and he plays it well. She looks good no matter what she does anyway but the movie does not lower her standards at all. It is a great movie for the adults to laugh with and the kids in the theatre were having a blast. Pirattes of the Caribbean better be good, or he won't be able to churn out the inevitable sequel which will most likely follow this gutter trash."
4286,"But compared to his other movie of 2003 (that would be the shockingly awful Bad Boys II), National Security is a rather easy - going and light - hearted cop comedy flick with quite a few good laughs. The point is, "" National Security "" provides some laughs and is an all - around good film, though not great. "" National Security "" is a decent flick and is well worth the price of admission, at least in the eyes of this reviewer. Tape becomes widespread, black community up in arms, cop is fired and taken to court with a all black jury, judge, and prosecutors."
4297,"It's all about the Tooth Fairy, a vengeful spirit of a woman who used to give children treats for their lost teeth before she was badly burned in her life and then wrongfully hung by the residents of Darkness Falls many years ago."
4301,"Nowadays color and plastic coat the fastest and most coveted motorcycles in the land, and ` Biker Boyz' heralds the passing with unrestrained glee."
4302,"In some places she is like the earlier film, innocent fun and pretty cool death scenes even though the quality is a bit low. "" The accidents are gruesome but funny when you take into consideration all the foreshadowing Death likes to give. The universal law of nature is that, well, Death sometimes misses its mark and has to fix its mistakes (which usually involves electrical equipment getting wet and other freak accidents of home improvement). Final Destination 2 is a very entertaining sequel and while the story is weaker then the first, the deaths are better. Kim visits Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), the only survivor of Flight 180 who is convinced to help out the survivors of Route 23."
4303,"He has even features and his acting stays on track. After Farrell goes thru the ` Farm', he is assigned a special case to investigate someone that he seems to care (Moynahan) about, as a possible double - agent."
4338,"Essence Attkins, Megan Good and Robinee Lee all dyme pieces also do acting jobs and the men in their lives played by Mel Jackson and Duane Martin make the film enjoyable also. LL Cool J and Gaberille Union have very good chemisty togetehr and carry the film. Gabrielle Union gives a standout performance as the unbelievable Eva Dandridge who needs someone like Ray to knock her from her high horse but she's that way cos she's taken too many knocks from life. This movie was touching and sincere for a Black movie (a trait which is played down in most Black flicks), there's been a recent departure from the gangsta and hood epics or drugs and money flicks. The "" Women only "" club that is the beauty parlor has several enjoyable scenes as well."
4339,"This is one of the funnier romantic comedies, if you'd like some laughs. Be thankful they are still making these types of movies today as in an era which is threatening to be devoured by action thrillers, fantasy adventure and shoot 'em ups this seems to be the only diversity left in motion pictures. It is there the audience experiences an honest, genuine quality time the coming off the screen between Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey. Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson made this film with impeccable comic timing and enjoyable performances. Hollywood has always worked on the basis that they stick to what has been tried and tested and has proved to work, that is why with a small plot change and a rehash of old jokes and situations they are able to reinvent their movies for a new generation of film buffs."
4340,"Then there is another masterpiece: "" The Godfather "", all though many people seem to agree that however great, "" The Godfather Part II "" is even better. Apparently it is one of the laws of physics that all though you personally feel a sequel outdoes the original, the masses would have you believe otherwise (the "" Toy Story "" - movies being the exception that proves the rule). All though it is apparent they used wires on some of the stunts, the mix of wire - and wireless stunts seem to balance themselves perfectly, giving a show fit for the greatest circus on Earth! Which is really sad, for if you love movies you should * really * learn to love history as well, as the two can make a fabulous pair whether it is done in the name of fantasy or fiction. This has plenty of Chan stunts with ladders, amazing kicks, and swords."
4341,"Everything makes sense now, and the characters are more fleshed out, which is a very good thing. This caused his other senses to become phenomenally acute, to the point where Matt can track criminals by their scent and use sound waves as a sort of radar. If you're a fan of the first two Batman movies, you'll find a lot to love in Daredevil. The fight scenes will make you wince at their realism, the love story is not corny or forced (as opposed to a certain flick called Just Married), and the characters are complex, uncertain people who just happen to don masks and fight on rooftops. Well, in today's feature, Matt hears someone crying for help, but when his love interest, Elektra, asks him to stay, he actually does."
4342,"The story is universal: the joy and pain of a serious first love, the pitfalls of communication, the unawareness of how words told and events improvidently related can be like mines going off. But the dialog and performances don't convince. When Tip's sister Noel (Zooey Deschanel) and Paul date and fall in love for each other, the friendship of Tip and Paul is shaken. Zooey Deschanel is a really a beautiful woman, has a stunning performance and shows a great chemistry with Paul Schneider. Likewise, Zooey Deschanel's performance was authentic and devastating."
4353,"The movie caught this perfectly, with Jackson's assumption that God's will is his will--the scene before the battle on Sunday, the contrast between his sentimental love of children and his' Kill them all' about his enemies, the constant references to Bible verses ripped out of context. As with Gettysburg, the battle scenes were impressive and awe - inspiring. Because God is on their side, the kind, virtuous, heroic, men of the southern army prevail in several combat engagements against the godless, sex - crazed, murderous barbarians of the north. Gods and Generals (despite the ravages of many critics) is a very good film. Chamberlain, Jackson and Lee were all, indeed, devoted followers of God, and it is almost poetic how Gods and Generals shows how their devotion enabled them to have the insane bravery that they did."
4354,"Kate Winslet is the reporter who interviews Gale during his last three days and she is convinced of his guilt and need to be executed, but as she interviews Gale she begins to question his guilt. Now on death row for the rape and murder of his best friend, Constance Hallaway (Laura Linney), reporter Bitsey Bloom interviews Gale on his last three days of life. This movie is by far one of Spacey's strongest performances, he is always very subtle and insightful portraying David Gale. Kate Winslet has such a strong presence and extreme intensity throughout the movie. Kevin Spacey and Laura Linney deliver great performances in the flashbacks."
4355,"This has to be one of the funniest movies ever made. Seriously, Old School has some of the funniest scenes in movie history. One of the greatest movies ever created! As Frank "" the tank "" he manages to be one of the funniest characters in movie history. For the group of guys that assemble to start the fraternity that is the heart of Old School are all in their early to mid thirties."
4364,"Thus, even though the story has nothing new to offer, the funny moments make' Bringing Down The House' fun to watch. Director Adam Shankman is also blessed with a strong supporting cast that includes Eugene Levy as a nerdish - but ` freaky' - business associate obsessed with wild black women like Charlene; Joan Plowright as a snooty, eccentric matron whose account Peter is determined to win for his firm; and Bette White as Peter's bigoted next door neighbor who is eyeing askance all the strange goings - on at the lawyer's house. A couple scenes on that end were actually moving. It's an old formula but one that works fairly well here, thanks, primarily, to the assured, high - energy performances of Martin and Latifah in the starring roles. Playing Peter's best mate, who is "" straight trippin' "" over Charlene, Levy steals practically every scene he appears in, with his dead - pan humour and flawless timing providing the some of the films most painfully funny scenes."
4365,"This movie did a VERY good job of describing awful atrocities without being overly gory or, worse, sensationalist and the use of humiliation and subordination as a weapon was subtly demonstrated. Movies are meant to entertain and make you feel good, not come out of the theatre wanting to slash your wrists. She is the possible love interest, or at least the needed female character, and she must annoy Waters by constantly suggesting things that even to her must sound stupid when followed by a lot of rebels. A lot of gunfire, explosions and bodies flying through the air. The is a solid "" war "" movie with U. S. Navy Seals, led by Bruce Willis, rescuing an American doctor and 70 of her patients from war - torn Nigeria."
4369,"It definitely won't be everyone's cup of tea, but the Hunted will make lots of action movie and martial arts movie fans pleased and satisfied. The movie is pretty well - produced overall, though there are a couple of glaring editing goof - ups (the knife being dunked into water, for example.) There wasn't a need for more dialog or love story and the fight scenes were amazingly well done. Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro played expertly off one another. The film story of Aaron Hallum played by the competent Benicio Del Toro and his counterpart, L. T. Bonham, played by Tommy Lee Jones, bring this theme into clear focus."
4390,"This marks the third film that William Goldman has adapted from a Stephen King novel, the others were Hearts in Atlantis (2001) and Misery (1990). Furthermore, he made other good movies as Â¨ Body heat Â¨, Â¨ The big chill Â¨, Â¨ Grand Canyon Â¨. Even those who don't usually like Science Fiction or monster movies are sure to enjoy it. But much of the movie is pretty scary, despite the absurdity of not only some of the aliens and the CGI, but the ending. And considering you're taking 1000 pages into a 135 page script, that's pretty good to have everything flow together."
4391,"Gwyneth Paltrow, Mike Myers, Candice Bergen, Christina Applegate, Kelly Preston, Rob Lowe, and a handful of other recognizable faces round out this eclectic, all - star cast burdened by screenwriter Eric Wald's lackluster script. Donna (Paltrow)--an intelligent and ambitious young woman trapped in her tiny hometown of Silver Springs, Nevada--hits rock bottom when her high - school sweetheart breaks up with her in a birthday card. Pretentious stewardesses from a more sophisticated airline inspire Donna to reach greater career heights, and she decides to interview for a place in the Royalty Airlines trainee program. His facial expressions, mannerisms, articulation, and speech patterns atone for all of the weaknesses inherent to his character, and Myers' personal style and improvisation attest to his incredible comedic ability. The film inaccurately portrays all of the airline stewardesses as young, beautiful twenty - to - thirty - something women--with the exception one effeminate, gay steward--and secures other fallible small - town stereotypes, but comedies thrive on generalities whether they are current or dated and so Ward should not be criticized on account of the misrepresentations."
4396,"Thanks to the mysterious story and the many twists it is hard to keep track, but when you are able to do so, you'll have fun watching it. For the majority of this film everything goes the way you expect it to, but yet it all still works reasonably well. This movie has an amazing number of plot twists and the pacing is quick so try to keep up with it. He is able to get a confession out of Dunbar, but as he digs deeper, he only finds more and more prove of contradictions and illegal practices. It may all seem confusing at first, but gifted director John McTiernan gradually weaves everything together, though perhaps not as seamlessly as one would ideally prefer."
4397,"The sentiments expressed go from being "" Fine Movie "" to "" Worst Movie ever, "" the last obviously coming from someone who rated "" Starship Troopers "" as the "" greatest Sci Fi movie ever made . "" An energy field would do sweet f*ck all to deflect radiation. The opening scene in Trafalgar Square with the crazy pigeons is better than anything in The Day After Tomorrow."
4398,"Inevitably, the hero not only succeeds in his newfound role, but excels, all thanks to his streetwise background, which allowed him to confound the numerous white people in these movies who were either thick - headed or cruel mercenaries. The backroom cunning and maneuvering is all supposed to look very devious, and Chris Rock turns it all to his advantage, outsmarting the professional politicians at every turn. Back in the late 70's and through the early 80's, Richard Pryor made a string of formulaic type movies, the formula being a street-wise black man is unexpectedly placed in a position of great responsibility or privilege for which he is totally unprepared: (Silver Streak, Brewster's Millions, Critical Condition, Bustin Loose). Rock speechifies in his presidential debate scene on the benefits of knocking children in the head when they misbehave, and receives a standing ovation. He doesn't lat anything go, he makes fun of politicians, African - Americans, whites, everyone."
4399,"Daphne turns out to be a hit with the poparazi and has a lot of fun. After going to so many fancy parties, she starts to forget who she really is, but her new guy makes her realize where her true values lie. There are some funny scenes throughout. FINAL VERDICT: An entertaining clean, fun film that all ages can enjoy. Amanda Bynes as Daphne Reynolds finally gets a chance to show of her incredible dramatic skills."
4406,"Man has some interested and funny concepts on a lot of the more modern subjects of what is going on in the world today. As he talks about 9/11, PU ** Y, DRUGS and about his family life throughout the film. If you want to laugh, and can find humor in almost anything when the right spin is put on it - this is a movie for you. But Dysfunktional Family proves that he should at least be given a strong round of applause. Dysfunktional Family keeps the skits to a bare - minimum, and focuses on Eddie Griffin's family, which is a positive thing."
4407,"Someone looking for a deep and meaningful plot will not find what they are looking for, however it is one of the best plots of all the Adam Sandler movies. Dave Buznick is played by Adam Sandler, a calm, relaxed, cool man (despite his "" troublesome "" childhood) who is, after a roll - on - aisles hilarious scene, given "" Anger Managemnt "" therapy for 20 hours, with none other than "" the "" Buddy Rydell. One great thing about this film, which is rare (sort - of) in comedies, is the acting. John Tutorro plays the hilarious "" Chuck "" anger pal to Dave; Allen Covert (star in basically all of Adam Sandler's movies) plays mr. "" big - weener "" Andrew; Jack Nicholson is the unbelievably annoying Buddy, and John Mackenroe even gets off the Tennis courts to make an appearance as a hilarious client to the "" therapy "". Some of the most standout funny scenes include a bizarre male - prostitute car - scene, the gut - burstingly funny scene in the plane, and when Buddy and Dave go on a terrible, morally unethical (yet damn funny) scene in which they kick the crap out of a bunch of Monks."
4408,"This film was sitting on the shelf for a couple of years before Lion's Gate released it theatrically. Karen Black and Sid Haig should really feel ashamed of their appearances here, and in fact the only redeeming member of the cast is the lovely and quite convincing Sheri Moon as Baby Firefly. But for those who are, the film is a true gem and a rarity; it is a kind of film that hasnt been seen on the screens in over twenty years and probably wont be for another twenty years. This film successfully and entertainingly portrays all of RZ's themes in about the same proportions as his music. Besides "" Scream, "" and "" Funny Games, "" this is the best horror film in the past 15 years!"
4410,"Whilst the scenes in BPM are not as polished or well done as those in the Matrix, they are entertaining enough and the choreography and use of props showed much more promise and imagination than those in the Wachowski Bros. productions (at least in regard to the Matrix Reloaded, anyhow). For both of the young leads to share the power was a great idea (also serving to bond them in their relationship), and it could make for a superb superhero - like sequel, since their fighting skills were radically increased by the power of the scroll. The Monk runs into him while both are on the run, and there are a number of cleverly staged scenes where Kar tries to palm a few extra bucks while the Monk attempts to teach him both ethics and enlightenment via koans about things like hot dogs and buns. As a wispy fantasy / action film, geared as much towards adolescents as any other age group, Bulletproof Monk is a rewarding way to spend an hour and a half. But you probably wouldn't watch Bulletproof Monk expecting a masterpiece."
4411,"Running Time: 80 minutes and rated PG for mild sensuality and language. The movie was obviously attempting to be like one of the classic screwball romantic comedies. In the DVD the director mentioned that that she wanted to capture the goofy and fun - loving interaction from the movies in the 60's like What's Up Doc with Barbara Stresan and she succeeded with this movie. One values beauty, the other education, and the other culture. The successful and handsome wolf executive Thomas Fuentes (Eduardo VerÃ¡stegui) has three sexy Latin girlfriends: in Miami, the waitress Cici (SofÃ­a Vergara); in Chicago, the intellectual lawyer Lorena (Roselyn Sanchez); and in New York, the "" daddy's girl "" Patricia (Jaci Velasquez)."
4412,"The DVD has interesting extras, and the commentary track by Guest and Levy discuss how, for example, Levy had to take lessons to get is guitar skills back, and how O'Hara learned to play the autoharp for this role. The three groups featured in this movie are as good as many of the 1960s groups that actually made a living entertaining. The brilliant characterizations by Levy, O'Hara, Guest, Shearer, McKean, Begley, and the rest of the cast are witty, knowing captures of such people. O'Hara is particularly adroit playing a middle - aged woman who has come to accept that her brief moment of fame and of passionate romance concluded more than half her lifetime ago--hers is the most affecting performance in the film. Levy could've gotten away with nothing more than a comic clichÃ© of a burn - out from the 1960s but instead manages to evoke a certain poignancy without falling into schmaltz."
4413,"Specifically because it is honest in the way it deals with the inmates of Camp Green Lake. It is this well nuanced core that makes everything else in the film believable. It dares to be compelling, where many family movies tend to play it safe and conventional. As such it transcends the family movie genera and simply becomes a good film that everyone can enjoy. the way everything was set up and everything had a purpose."
4414,"But if the film has a great duo like Chris Farley and David Spade, the antics speak for themselves. PJ gets his smokin' hot cousin, Shondra to help, but B - Rad is hard to change. Regina Hall is amusing as Shondra who in the beginning thinks he's strange but towards the end she falls for him and accepts him for who he truly is."
4426,"Basically its a slick thriller about money and power, with a good cast, solid plot and enough well crafted twists to make it a little special. The movie is paced smoothly (there are no tedious scenes or moments you feel you've missed something), the acting is excellent (Hoffman's character seems overdone at first, but the creepy - weird character he plays is believable and, therefore, all the more serious and scary), the cons they play are very smart (and convincing), and the way it all comes together at the end is just beautiful (although the overall scheme is complex and plays many twists on the audience, it is not at all difficult to follow what' really' happens). (There must always be an enticing, enigmatic woman for a film of this kind to keep viewers engrossed, e. g., "" The Thomas Crown Affair "".) No mind bending twists beyond the twists that have to be constructed for a picture like this to succeed, and succeed it does. You will be consumed with numerous narrative twists."
4434,"Owning Mahowny tells the famous and true story of a mid-level bank manager at the CIBC, who in the early 80s, stole $10, 000, 000 from several high profile clients, and a few non-existent ones. Philip Seymour Hoffman is spot on perfect as Mahowny, focused on the next hand, rarely raising his eyes to the camera. John Hurt is also wonderful as the malevolent casino boss who is all too happy to take Mahowny's money and not care where it came from. Hoffman gives a yeoman's if not overly subdued performance as Dan Mahowny, and the film for the most part is a better than average watch. The direction is clever, in particular the ironic use of scenes showing the symbiotic relationship of bank and casino."
4427,"He also effectively creates two very attractive atmospheres, especially for fantasy fans--a "" Twilight Zone "" (1959) - like conundrum and a sustained dark ambiance. The acting is perfect, each character is played extremely well by their respective actors, Ray Liotta, John Cusack, Amanda Peet and many others really do make this a top notch movie and one that will keep you guessing right till the final credits. The cast go a long way to helping this by having quite a few big names as well as pretty good performances. While Identity isn't exactly a bastion of graphic violence, there are a number of strongly visceral scenes and shots that are extremely well done and effective for seeming realistic. Peet is the standout from the rest but McGinley, De Mornay and others all do well."
4428,"This is a great compendium of interviews and excerpts form the films of the late sixties and early 70s that were a counter movement to the big Studio Films of the late sixties. Directed by Ted Demme, it is obviously a labor of love of the films of the period, but it gives short shrift to the masterpieces of the times. The film is rich with interviews and opinions of filmmakers. There are also many fine excerpts from Al Pacino's break - through film "" The Panic in Needle Park "", and interviews from Dennis Hopper on the making of "" Easy Rider "", and interviews from Sydney Pollack about making films. A documentary dealing with American films made in the nineteen - seventies, with major emphasis on experimentation with new styles of cinematic expression and departure from the traditional style of film production."
4431,"Lizzie McGuire (Hilary Duff) has finally graduated from middle school and now her class is taking a two week trip to Rome along with her best friend Gordo (Adam Lamberg), the snobby and popular Kate Sanders (Ashlie Brillault) and the airheaded but hilarious Ethan Craft (Clayton Snyder). But like other genres also like horror, sci fi, good dramas. Then look no further, rent this movie on either DVD / Video, grab the delicious popcorn (and Coke), turn on the TV and get ready for over a hour of fun, excitement and laughs with Lizzie! She seems like a real smart down to earth gal with a good head on her shoulders."
4432,"A lot has been said about this movie, as is the case with many recent Hollywood comics adaptations. So the mutant phenomenon was well explained, the characters and their abilities introduced, and the plot (which actually had a story, unlike many action flicks) was carried out smoothly. You see their abilities, you see whose side they're on, you even learn more about their personalities as the movie progresses. The highlight of the film was definitely Mystique's transformation scenes, very well done. Nightcrawler was a truly brilliant character to bring into the sequel of the film."
4435,"Daddy Day Care really is fun for all the family and has a cast of characters that you will genuinely care about, Murphy, Garlin and Huston; along with the children all give fine performances making Daddy Day Care a hit. Caught this today on DVD with a buddy's grand - kids, and was pleasantly surprised. Eddie Murphy (now into his family man image phase) and fellow co-stars like Steve Zahn (playing yet another geeky role with slick comic timing) really capture the screen with their ability to play such innocently playful and tender roles and when you watch them engage in conversations with the child actors (who must have been a handful to manage), one can tell instantly there was chemistry on and off screen there (even child actors are kids and kids know who to trust) that went on to boost the production set. The credits even run a series of bloopers which showed the whole cast and crew crying out in laughter after the some of the cherubic kids deliver hilarious comments in between takes. If you like movies that require no usage of brain cells, then you might think this one is good enough to watch."
4437,"Rachel Weisz is amazing as art student who makes changes to a lonely guy who just wants to fit in. The story in true Neil Labute fashion takes a macabre turn and makes you question everything that you have done in your relationship and gives you a well deserved punch in the stomach in the reality department as well. Her performance is beyond brilliant and she single handily carries this movie on her shoulders with her performance. Paul Rudd, Fred Weller and Gretchen Mole do great work as well and Neil Labute proves once again to be a profound playwright of uncanny wisdom of the evil that resides in the human heart. Usually excellent actors (Paul Rudd, Rachel Weisz, Frederick Weller) give overly fussy, theatrical performances that seem designed to inject some energy into the script's turgid dialog and unbelievable plot turns."
4447,"The Matrix Reloaded has everything you could possibly want from a summer blockbuster but it like its predecessor has a heck of a lot more and while Reloaded is not as good as the first Matrix film it sure is close to the standard of the original. In part 1 he was very good, especially when he exposed Neo to the matrix with a mix of playful wit and serious touches when they were needed. The Matrix Reloaded is an excellent film and it deserves a lot more respect than it is getting and it is definitely underrated. Occasionally the special effects are slightly wanting (in Neo's fight with Agent Smiths it is clear when it is a visual effect rather than the real thing) but these are minor quibbles compared to some sterling work. The reviewers who feel that the second and third movies were "" deep "" should go see some truly deep movies."
4448,"This is many things--an affectionate remake of those silly Doris Day / Rock Hudson movies; a sweet sendup of them at the same time; a perfect example of 1960s sex comedies with a 2000s twist; a huge barrel of laughs for film buffs with its perfect remake of a 1960s film and an examination of sexual mores and stereotypes of the 1960s. The cast is right on target--Zellweger and McGregor give their all to the performances--they wink at the audience all the time. It is sharp and funny bit occasionally bogs down and some of the twists are too obvious. DOWN WITH LOVE, director Peyton Reed's homage / spoof of the Doris Day / Rock Hudson sex comedies of the early 60s, is a delightful bit of fluff in a movie season filled with inferior sequels and overwrought epics. Dazzling to watch, with Givenchy - inspired costumes (if Daniel Orlandi does not receive an Oscar for his work, his peers should turn in their Designer cards), wonderfully over-the-top sets (EVERYBODY in those 60s films lived in apartments you could land airplanes in), and a' More 1963 New York than 1963 New York' look (created on the studio back lot, with ample support from CGI), the film would deserve a viewing even if the cast never uttered a line of dialog!"
4451,"There are some hilarious scenes, the opening cookie scene for instance, others miss the target slightly but still a good film. Bruce is nearly 40 years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery that's seeking to bake the world's biggest cookie. The movie feels ggooooodd (see the movie to understand), has a very nice feeling, tackles the idea appropriately and better than expected and overall should never have been called slapped together just to save Carrey's career (which wasn't goin' anywhere.) His most accomplished' straight' role, the Man on the Moon, is less well known that his comedy romps - or The Truman Show (on which the Academy heaped three nominations whilst bypassing Carrey). As you probably know from hearing about this movie in the first place, Carrey's pitch - perfect acting stays in character (which, luckily enough, is him), and controls and gives atmosphere to the movie scene by scene."
4453,"Pixar Studios have done it again. The voice cast as in many animated movies is impressive but the one that stood out was Ellen DeGeneres as Dory that you love to hate. The most excellent thing about "" Finding Nemo "" is the perfect timing, just like in "" Monsters, Inc "" the jokes are extremely well placed in a quick pace and are good for more then just a few laughs. Gorgeous to look at and utterly adorable, Finding Nemo sets the standard for how animated movies should being terms of entertainment value as well as story and themes â€“ ending with the touching, thought - provoking message of how too much protectiveness on the parent's side will repel, but, no matter how independent a child (or fish) believes themselves to be, they'll always need their parents. Note the masterwork that occurs as an upbeat, jovial number quickly escalates into something darker in a matter of minutes."
4454,"The action is very nice, the landscapes and Venice are real eye - candy, the story is OK and the special effects are stunning. Director F. Gary Gray hasn't remade the Italian Job of 1969, in fact he hasn't even re-imaged it, the minis are in there, the gold is in there, but all the stand out moments so beloved by many in the 69 film of the same name are not to be seen at all. Mark Wahlberg, Mos Def, Jason Statham, Seth Green and the delectably delicious Charlize Theron all come out smelling of roses, whilst Edward Norton really had no cause for concern because his portrayal as Steve is a smarmy delight. Her entrance scene, particularly, was like something out of Resident Evil or Tomb Raider which were both a) more entertaining and b) had better beginnings because they couldn't mess up a game like they could with British cinema which was already chock - full of spark, people you genuinely feel something for and moments of inspiration. Mos Def, Jason Steadham, Ed Norton, Seth Green and Charlize Theron all turn in solid, fat - free performances."
4455,"Stan is a special effects master who has created scary monsters for some great flicks: Alien, Predator, Artificial Intelligence, Edward Scissorhands, Chiller, The Hand and more. Wrong Turn is a great throwback to the classic horror movies of the 70's and 80's, with the an excellent production budget which a lot of the older classics simply could not afford to have. Schmidt could have easily dived down the gore shoot to hell but he made a wise choice that works in spades. Throughout the whole movie you repeatedly get that uncomfortable feeling of being watched by someone, and the scares which constantly appear through the movie just add to the atmosphere. Dushku is strong and emulates some of her ` Buffy the Vampire Slayer' character, Faith in her portrayal here."
4456,"The documentarian must be objective while often prone to being seductively enmeshed in his / her subjects' views of their lives. Based on a U. S. Post Office investigation leading to a search of the Friedman's Great Neck, N. Y. home it is immediately clear that the pater familias at the least was a dedicated, devoted collector of sickening homosexual kiddie porn. An expert debunker of many such cases is on screen to offer her views. What followed the investigation was the loding of so many charges against each defendant as to constitute an extraordinary episode of overcharging. In 1987, Great Neck, Long Island, a comfortable upper middle class town, was rocked when Arnold Friedman, a respected high school teacher and his 18 - year old son, Jessie were arrested on charges of molestation, rape, and sodomy against young boys to whom they taught computer classes in their basement."
4457,"As far as the racing scenes go, "" 2 Fast 2 Furious "" is pretty good. The one and only interesting stunt is the well done truck scene which is shown in it's entirety (yes, it's only about 10 seconds) during the previews. The crowning hilarity regarding the race scenes was that a) the cars apparently needed nitrous to reach 100mph, and b) When they hit the nitro the cars went into hyperspace. Fast cars, pretty girls, high speed chases, solid racing. It has a better plot, expanded action scenes, and so on."
4534,"and the grinning skeletons come into view, with Badelt's pounding score keeping time to the beat of their maniacal deck - swabbing. Barbossa kidnaps Elizabeth, and the blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), who loves her, releases Jack Sparrow and they steal the fastest vessel of the navy to follow the Black Pearl, Will trying to save Elizabeth, and Jack trying to retrieve his ship. The supernatural adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow, Elizabeth Swann, Will Turner and Barbossa are so spectacular that really deserves to be included among the best movies (Top 250) in IMDb. Shortly before the swordfight in the caves with Barbossa and being shown to be skeletal, Jack stole one of the cursed coins from the chest. The script is one of the main stars of the film itself, every line that seems to come out of Sparrow or Barbossa's mouth or any of the other cast is original."
4509,"Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels were excellent in the first film and in a different league to the two actors in the roles as the young Harry and Lloyd (the guy cast as Lloyd does look like Carrey, except for the blue eyes). The running time is also a good thing as its only 82 minutes long though sometimes it feels longer."
4510,"Ford plays Joe Gavilan, a cop working real estate on the side and Josh Hartnett is his younger partner KC Calden, who works a yoga class on the side, sleeps with his customers and is also an aspiring actor. In Hollywood, as in LA in general, it seems that everyone has something else that they'd rather be doing than their actual job, so they're all really focusing on that instead, while the day job pays the bills. Gavilan's first concern upon arriving at any crime scene is that he gets some food, just the way he likes it. They get away with it because Gavilan, at least, is also a great detective. Everyone is constantly on their cell phones."
4511,"This is a decent, worthwhile movie, even though it could have played it for even greater drama and laughs. It's got a simple premise, a cute story, engaging leads, and an interesting story with more than a handful of laughs. What redeems the film is its endearing leads and airy sense of romance, and occasionally a witty one - liner. Adam (Wilson) is heading to the fictional island of St. Charles, located near Maine."
4546,"The original songs (from the people who brought you "" Fame "") are also good--occasionally terrific. The kids fare much better in general, and their musical performances are their real strengths (unsurprisingly). So the film is sold and written about in the press as a depiction of this camp for misfits, gays and drag queens. There are rousing renditions of songs from Fosse and Gospel at Colonnus and other shows. The fun moments are fun and much of the humor is cute and the "" oh no she didn't moments "" are equally satisfying."
4514,"Not just pop songs populate the film, but songs who's clever lyrics enhance the scene they're being played over. So let's just say that, if you're three years old this movie rocks! Everything about this movie looks good. There must be like a hundred songs on the soundtrack, including complete albums by the Prodigy. If you're into a fast and fun movie, filled with lots of action, noise and over-the-top scenes, then Charlie's Angels is for you!"
4530,"He was interested in the tie - in products filling the shelves in all the stores on release. The close ups of the hulk work, because his facial expressions are well done and you can actually feel sympathy for him. Overall, Hulk is a refreshing change from standard and bland superhero movies. In a time where superhero movies seem to come from the assembly line and standards are (sadly) set already it is hard to find gems that really transcend these paradigms. First, Ang Lee's film is extremely faithful to the comics."
4531,"It had a funny central idea, more than a few solid laughs, and a really entertaining lead character. Of course it was a by - the - numbers plot line as predictable as Oregon rain, but Witherspoon, et al played it lightly and for laughs and it worked. For every brilliant sequel like' Aliens' or' Godfather: Part II', there are dozens of painfully lame successors. As virtually every other reviewer on the planet has noted, the original' Blonde' had some amusing moments, most of which were supplied by Ms. Witherspoon, who managed to inject the character of Elle Woods with a believable combination of ditziness and sweet charm. Also bolstering the original film was co-star Jennifer Coolidge, who played her dim - bulb shtick to perfection as Elle's beautician friend Paulette."
4532,""" Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas "" is a wonderful animated feature by Dreamworks. it's got humor, tones of adventure, great plot, really interesting stuff going on, lots of well - known "" voices "" and it's extremely exciting. "" Sinbad: Legend Of The Seven Seas "" is a beautifully animated adventure film from the folks at Dreamworks. Initially, Sinbad plans to sail away as soon as his ship is over the horizon, but when Proteus's fiancÃ©e Marina (voice of Catherine Zeta - Jones) turns up as a stowaway on his ship he has to change his plans. The sailor of legend is framed by the goddess Eris for the theft of the Book of Peace, as an object with extraordinary power has been stolen and Simbad must retrieve it but if he doesn't obtain it, his friend prince will be beheaded."
4533,"Everybody had great expectations and it was clear that this movie would have lots of enemies, especially if someone else than Cameron was going to direct. Yes, some of the jokes are actually quite funny, but really, why would the Terminator smash the gay glasses? The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. Visually, it's close to Cameron's Terminators but on paper, it's a different story. Terminator was always more than just an action film, it had a story that kept the other movies of the franchise balanced."
4535,"For a couple of bucks shelled out at the DVD rental shop, it takes one to a different world for close to two hours. Sure, both characters were CGI rendered, but Mr. Hyde's size carried a credible degree of mass and weight, whereas the Hulk often moved as if mass-less, making him seem too two dimensional. Jason Flyming brings a new characterization of a tormented Dr. Jekyll, who as Mr. Hyde is transformed into a creature Bruce Banner would be proud of. A bunch of fictional characters (Mina Harker, Captain Nemo, Allan Quatermain, the Invisible Man, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Dorian Gray, Tom Sawyer) are called together in 1899 to combat a madman who threatens to take over the world. LXG is a pleasant film that could have been truly extraordinary."
4536,"Whether you wish to view the more fanciful scenes as literal or the product of a dying boy's imagination, one strong theme connects all the stories. Each sub-story revolves around a profound change. M. David Mullen's extraordinary photography makes almost every frame exciting and wonderful to look at. The performances of the actors, working with the Polish Brothers' inspiringly offbeat script, are pitch - perfect and give the film its emotional punch. Many will surely find this film to be slow moving, arty, pretentious and boring, while others will be intrigued by its originality and visionary quality."
4537,"And Joe Pantoliano makes every movie better. The two funniest scenes are when Burnett and Lowery are scaring the hell out of Burnett's daughter's date and after the chase scene with the dead bodies and Captain Howard goes off on the two. Otherwise it was very funny, due to the amazing chemistry between the two leads. To hell with the elements that the Academy looks at, appreciate the film for all the stuff that blows up and the laughs the cast can bring you to. The car chase scene on the highway was way better than the Matrix Reloaded's car chase scene, it puts that one to shame."
4538,"On the laughter front it was quite satisfying, easily outmanoeuvering the once - too - often repeated Austin Powers, putting anything recent by Leslie Nielsen to shame and being an altogether fine Bond spoof. A lower budget than the AUSTIN POWERS series means there are fewer elaborate set pieces, but some scenes work very well and there are some witty exchanges of dialogue. Expect lots of visual humour, but also the odd moment of funny dialogue (the "" making love "" dialogue scene is quite hilarious) The plot is standard Bond fare: A French tycoon is up to no good, stealing crown jewels and trying to become king of. The answer surprisingly is quite well, although the film does have flat spots and gags that somewhat misfire. Johnny English is a strange character - he has his moments where he seems a little intelligent and he has a big talent for coming up with excuses, but apart from that, he is immensely stupid - stupid to a point where the fun stops."
4543,"Let's hope the next installment has the same action, fast paced locations and even more realism in the storyline. Things keep moving, stunts every few minutes, explosions, gunfire, jumping off tall buildings, dazzling neon explosions, all accompanied by Alan Silvestri's booming soundtrack music. Still, de Bont has chosen good locations and sets for the film, and there is a blessedly welcome lack of the "" Matrix "" - style visuals and candy - colored bombast so popular in action films of recent memory. Lara is a British citizen of refined taste, highly competent in various forms of weaponry, travels around the globe to exotic locations, has friends (and lovers) in virtually every port, uses a wide variety of nifty gadgets, has an amusing yet dry form of wit, looks fabulous, and routinely saves the world from a madman bent on global domination. However, this movie had just the right combination of action, plot, colorful characters, brains & beauty (courtesy of Ms. Jolie)."
4544,"' This is certainly a reason why Gary Ross's Seabiscuit tugs so effectively at the heartstrings. There is nothing in Seabiscuit that's very original; it awakens involuntary flashbacks to many traditional Rocky-esque sports biopics as one watches. It's important, anyway - if young people do come to see Seabiscuit - for them to get the simplified, but nonetheless just portrait of the times provided with authentic stills and footage, and the voiceover narration by iconic historian David ("" The Civil War "") McCullough. The travelogue of the Depression and Prohibition years includes a quiet but heartfelt plug for FDR and that, too, is moving, especially in today's post-Yuppie mood of numbingly exploitive jingoism. Seabiscuit's ability to tug at the heartstrings first appears when Red Pollard is let go by his destitute father so he can be a jockey."
4545,Rodriguez is a very good director when it comes to style and action and his influence makes this film a lot more fun than others likely would. The reason the silliness doesn't really damage the film is because the actors seem to play to it - and a very fine series of performances these are. Pretty much all the cast are good fun and their performances are about as hammy and fun as you can imagine. Sabara is great fun - a cool kid without any of the horrid cutesy stuff that can happen. The adult cast will provide much of the fun for the adults watching - there is a large number of Rodriguez regulars in the cast who all overplay to suit the sense of fun the film has.
4551,"That makes all his early antics hard to laugh at because now all you can see is a jerk hurting people. Luckily, the funny moments increase a bit in the final stretches of the movie. Joining the cast again are Seann William Scott as the funny Stifler and a hilarious Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad. Jennifer Coolidge also again makes an always hilarious cameo as Stifler's mom. Eugene Levy, Fred Willard and Deborah Rush have good moments in the film."
4552,"Ben plays Gigli, an accent challenged goon who is as believable as Madonna in a nuns uniform, and Jennifer plays Ricky, a lesbian gangster who is primarily hired to ensure that Gigli doesn't screw things up. Nothing was expected of these other entries, but Gigli had the star power of the two most talked about celebrities in Tinseltown. With a recipe as rich as these ingredients suggest, one's expectations are set to a higher standard."
4555,"But ten minutes later, the magic began. Their acting was so real, their expressions so priceless. The film is very light - hearted, well scripted, well directed, excellent costumes, brilliant acting skills, and finally very easy to follow the storyline. Please do yourself a favor and rent this DVD (and order a pizza) and watch it at home with your family - maybe it will do you some good. There are many deserving performances, mostly dramatic, that get Oscar nominations each year."
4556,"Better than anticipated big - screen adaptation of the 1970s cult classic police drama about the elite Special Weapons and Techniques division of the LAPD skillfully directed by tv veteran Clark Johnson (who cut his chops on' Homicide: Life on The Street' and' The Shield) with the focus on an oily French baddie (Martinez) making a routine prison transfer a dicey situation when he proclaims to give $100 M for his release from the cops custody ensuing all sorts of pitfalls and unexpected turns along the way. This film has a nice gradual build to its eventual payoff and Colin Farrell and Samuel L. Jackson are in good form. Just ignore the plot holes, leaps of logic, and occasional cold - bloodedness, and enjoy the fast - paced action and macho camaraderie! After' DIRTY DOZEN' - like training scenes, and embarrassing the egotistical Fuller by ace - ing his terrorist hijacking training scenario ("" Best time ever, right? "" S. W. A. T. may be the best action film since THE TRANSPORTER."
4557,"Though limited in acting range, Ms. Hudson is blessed with her mother Goldie's winning smile and a screen - persona tailor - made for light comedy. First, the French one sees portrayed in the film belong to the high classes that are imbued in their traditions, savoir faire, their sense of style and being B. C. B. G., something the Americans, being somehow a new society without those traditions cannot comprehend. In her many books about life in that country, the study in the contrasts she sees, are at center stage and the mixing of Americans with the French bourgeoisie produces surprising results that make the reading of her novels more compelling for the joy they bring to her readers. The delicious Leslie Caron plays Madame de Persand with great panache. In spite of not being up to some of his best movies, James Ivory still shows he has a keen eye for presenting the material on the screen."
4558,"Better yet the whole family can enjoy it while you all go' Wow, wow, WOW' every 15 seconds. And whether you are a surfer or not, it won't matter, when you watch this movie you will be transported for 90 minutes into the tube, plus you get to see some terrific places. A great use of expressions via actual spoken word and cinematography, to help people better understand the life of a "" surfer "". Step Into Liquid is full of breathtaking cinematography of (mostly American) surfers achieving heroic feats of beauty in the lap of Neptune. First off if you're a fan of any of the endless summer movies or others then this movie will be a great addition."
4567,"If you are a fan of the Friday the 13th series, this had so many tributes to the originality, sex, drugs, alcohol, stupid teens, and clichÃ© bad acting. But he surprises Freddy by staying and for the ultimate battle of who's victims are who. This film obviously appeals to fans of Jason and Freddy but it also introduces a new generation of young adults to two classical' slasher' characters (who should not judge the characters just on this film). Freddy Vs. Jason wasn't complete garabage, it was okay."
4568,"2 - Characters you really care about, led by three actors who almost always give solid performances: Robert Duvall (the best in here), Costner and Annette Bening. A rich rancher named Denton Baxter (Michael Gambon) hates "" Freegrazers "" and tells them to take their man and keep moving. He seems to have found his mark as a directer with this genre. The scenery is beautiful and their are so many shots with skylines and mountains and wide open prairies and these shots help tell the story in the film. Like many good westerns, Open Range's central concerns lie around personal freedom and moral rectitude - the balance between which gives a good deal of the narrative its necessary tension."
4570,"Robert Pulcini and Sheri Springer Berman, who wrote and directed the film together, create a surrealistic tone by having Pekar and his real friends and companions frequently appear on screen next to the actors who are portraying them (some of them dead ringers for the originals). ` American Splendor' is a paean to all the social misfits in the world, people who, for whatever reason, can't seem to fit into society's prescribed mold but who often develop strong, meaningful bonds with similar individuals. As Pekar, Paul Giametti turns in a flawless performance, capturing the nebbishness, cantankerousness and ultimate likeability of the man he is portraying. In a land dominated by TV where freaks and saints both can enjoy fifteen minutes of fame, Pekar becomes an irregular guest on late night national TV shows. A clever approach that works has the real Harvey, and to a lesser extent the real Joyce, alternate with Giamatti and Davis in telling their tales."
4571,"The special effects are cool and the stunts are fairly good. Taking advantage of a couple of hot teen television properties at the time, MGM fashioned this fantasy for kids about a typical teenage boy with one big secret. There is great chemistry between Frankie Muniz and Hilary Duff. There are more such as when Cody is at Natalie's birthday party and he's spying on Dr. Connors and the beginning, it's really hard to pick a favorite one, but the diner scene and the ending come off as the best. The acting is great, long time friends Frankie Muniz and Hilary Duff star and Hilary Duff shows the talent that would carry her through the next few years and Frankie Muniz is no slacker in the role of Cody Banks and it's no surprise that he would go on to be a star even if he never got as much fame as Hilary."
4598,"Eva Mendes is in about 4 scenes but does a great job including the rest of the cast (Ruben Blades, Cheech Marin, Mickey Rourke, Willem Dafoe, and Enrique Iglesias). It is an incredible Spanish track, worth watching the entire credits! Danny Trejo was great as Cucuy, Sands' tail on El Mariachi. El Mariachi's friends, Lorenzo (Enrique Iglesias), and Fideo (Marco Leonardi) were interesting. Pedro ArmendÃ¡riz Jr. gave a decent performance as the president."
4625,"His bosses give him one final job: bring Travis (Sean William Scott, in a refreshing departure from the "" horny idiot "" style of movies) back from South America to the States. He has made another big screen hit, and this time, he has used every trick in the book from the WWE. Better yet, it should the "" E "" man; Emeril Lagasse. And in case you need an introduction to The Rock, a. k. a. Dwayne Johnson, he is a well - known wrestler, son of Rocky Johnson. He is hired by rich people to seek out certain things--people, objects, etc.--and return them to the payer."
4593,"Undoubtedly, those qualities will turn off a great deal of viewers, whether because they hate MTV / attention - deficit - disorder - styled editing, genre hopping or a lack of real - world believability. While The Medallion is certainly not a film without flaws, it is satisfying on the whole if you approach it as a comic book / cartoon - styled Jackie Chan actioner. There are also more straightforward comedy elements--especially when Evans is on screen, the film almost becomes a slapstick farce--there are Matrix - styled fantasy / action aspects, and there is a romance subplot. Jackie Chan fans seeking a return to films that are solely kung fu - oriented will likely be disappointed, but if you have broader tastes, The Medallion might hit the spot. Every 1000 years a child is born who can wield the power of two halves of a supernatural medallion, which can bestow superhuman strength and immortality, as well as take life away."
4594,"Sure, it had quite a disappointing climax and Victor Salva is an infamous figure in Hollywood but his visions did lead to one of the best horror films in the post-Scream era. This sequel takes place a few days after the original (of which the happenings can be heard on radio - broadcasts all the time) and features a bus full of high school jocks and cheerleaders terrorized by the Creeper. Victor Salva makes great use of the' surprise element'. That movie earned a lot of its merits through tension, genuine shocks, and a general cloud of mystery of the "" Creeper "" monster. While it's as raucous and entertaining as one could hope for, it's also a surprisingly conventional effort from writer - director Victor Salva, whose best work (POWDER, RITES OF PASSAGE, etc.) has always focused on small groups of characters caught up in extreme situations."
4595,"The best bits of turmoil and conflict, of passion and temptation and surrender, were skimmed through so quickly it seemed as if someone thought they were the annoying - but - necessary bits when they should have been the real meat of the film. A confusing plot, a lack of purpose, and sometimes sleepy performances would often damn a movie, but for some reason, "" The Order "" remains watchable. Without wanting to give away the entire plot Sin Eater is a movie which takes risks - it's not afraid of its take on religion and is filmed with panache, boasts good performances, and some effective cinematography. The entire cast which, seems to be little more than a Knight's Tale reunion all turn in great performances. It deals with a young reverend named Alex Bernier (Heath Ledger) is a member of an arcane order of priests known as Carolingians, he is sent to Rome to investigate the troubling death of the head of his order."
4597,"Ridley Scott and Nicolas Cage deliver some of their best and most intelligent work in a few years, even if Matchstick Men is not quite either's great contribution for this year in film. What they have done, from Eric Garcia's novel (adapted by The Griffins), come off rather entertaining, if anything else, and boasts much more thought than would usually be attributed to such a Hollywood film. Add then an outgoing, occasionally sneaky daughter (Alison Lohman in a performance that skillfully balances sweetness and irritability, sorrow and playfulness in a teenage girl) to the mix, along with a protÃ©gÃ© - cum - partner (a cool Sam Rockwell) who has a love / loathe relationship Roy, and there's the map work for an interesting, if here and there predictable, drama / comedy / crime film. This echoes the style that Scorsese used in Bringing out the Dead, also with Cage, in moving the film to get so into the mood that the story, no matter how intriguing and important, becomes secondary. Matchstick Men is witty, sometimes wonderful moviemaking."
4600,"When the movie hits you right, it's a pure pleasure from its unassuming start (a beautifully lit shot up Johanssen's underwear - clothed behind) to its ambiguous but meaningful ending. He gets comical faxes from his wife about bookshelves and carpet samples, but he gives off the impression that he's come to the point where he doesn't even care anymore. The movie takes a while to truly glean out the deep - seated motivations of both of its characters, but they become fully - realized in a marvelous scene where Bob and Charlottelay fully - clothed in bed together. Coppola's screenplay takes these two separate beings, far apart in age and experiences, and makes a profound statement - both are in the same exact emotional limbo. He has worked on Coppola's husband's (Adaptation, Being John Malkovich director Spike Jonze) films before, but this is his finest, most beautiful work yet."
4617,"Quaid and Stone play an NYC couple with high - end careers and two mouthy, spoiled kids who, after one of the children is nearly creamed by an SUV, decide to pack up and move to the country. Noted for her cool, chilly roles in films like "" Sliver "", "" Intersection "" and "" Basic Instinct "", here she is a hopelessly edgy bundle of nerves who squeals and screams every time anything unexpected happens like someone coming to the door or coming out of the water and having someone at the edge of the pool! The director and producer of documentaries Cooper Tilson (Dennis Quaid) and his wife, the executive Leah Tilson (Sharon Stone) have a stressed life with their two children in New York. Dad's inspired to create one of his "" labour of love "" documentaries."
4618,"Osment was a superb cast in this movie because of his unchanging facial expression. There are swashbuckling sword fights and several surprises that keep it moving at a pleasant pace. The surprises are what make it so special. Haley Joel Osment delivers a solid portrayal of Walter. The uncles are very realistic characterizations, and Texas holds many characters like them."
4619,"Basing the two species on a genetic, scientific idea makes them work exceedingly well, and removes all those problems that mysticism brings to a film, like reflections or holy items. It's slick, modern, fast - paced action combined with classic, Gothic Vampire & Werewolf ideas, like the Vamp's high - tech weapons being kept in a massive, stately manor. K. Beckinsale's character is great for this, it's someone who could easily be a guy. Although the small action scenes work very well, the more elaborate scenes are disjointed, confused, and somewhat silly. This was because it is first and foremost a Kate Beckensale's vehicle, as emphasized by recent trailer for the sequel."
4624,"In Danny De Vito's "" Duplex, "" Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore play a young couple who buy a "" dream apartment "" in Brooklyn whose amenities include everything two upwardly mobile yuppies could possibly want: ample space, solid wood floors, three glorious fireplaces, and, above all, a quiet environment where Alex, a budding novelist, can spend his days writing in uninterrupted peace and quiet. It's always nice to find a simple, pleasant comedy amidst the horde of mainstream moneymakers released every year. In a variety of scenarios, most comical and some just plain, outright strange, the nice couple turn into psycho landlords and the nice old lady turns into the crazy bat upstairs. Put this on last night not know anything about it and was pleasantly surprised. Stiller and Barrymore worked well together and had a good chemistry, and it was a nice surprise to watch a comedy without too many attempts at silly slapstick."
4627,"Both historically correct in many respects, as well as a fantastically well - written epic with an excessively well - rounded cast (all of which deserve Oscar nominations), the film has many insightful glimpses into one man's journey toward his greatest triumph. From a purely historical standpoint, the film offers a shocking glimpse into power and politics, as Cardinals attempt to bend and wrestle princes and monarchs to their side. The dialogue is unusually rich, spattered with direct quotes from Luther's literary works. Joseph Fiennes did what he does best as the angst - riddled Luther, playing a complex and haunted character that filled the screen even in his quietest moments. The supporting cast was also fabulous, particularly the merry - in - the - face - of - danger performances by Bruno Ganz and Peter Ustinov."
4628,"Polley gives a remarkable performance as a young wife and mother who is diagnosed with terminal cancer and with the few precious months left to her own devices she decides not to tell anyone but instead attempts to live life by her own guidelines including taking a lover (Ruffalo in a genial turn) and setting her family up with a new mother figure in the form of new next door neighbor Watling (who gives a heartrending speech about her occupation as a nurse) and in the process realizing just how important it is to live life each day as if it were indeed your last. Director Isabel Coixet adapts Nanci Kincaid's short story' Pretending the Bed is a Raft' with clear - eyed sharpness allowing the ultimate heartbreak to occur off - screen and instead focusing on the funny and poignant pangs her protagonist silently endures. The plot of this beautiful film seems a trivial melodrama, but the way it was told by scriptwriter / director Isabel Coixet makes a great difference. Isabel Coixet led everything wonderfully, and the entire cast is magnificent (even Scott Speedman is pretty good). Amanda Plummer, as Ann's obsessed - with - food friend, proves definitely her taste for bizarre characters (what's far from being a fault, in her case); Deborah Harry is surprising as Ann's bitter mother; Mark Ruffalo (one of the best actors nowadays), as a lonely man who falls in love with Ann, is captivating and passionate, and Leonor Watling is not only a beautiful Spanish girl."
4629,"The Fantasy Girl in the Extra is the best part of the DVD. Some are hilarious, others make you wonder who looked at the script and thought' let's make this movie . ' This is why it would be far better on the small screen; stretching a joke for 10 to 20 minutes is hard, 90 minutes is impossible. The performances from the cast, all of whom have very little to actually do, are all OK. First off, the plot is all over the place and can't follow all the multiple "" misunderstandings "" very well at all."
4631,"The rendering is a true tour - de-force. Everything from the opening dance - hall sequence to the extraordinary use of the Kyrie from Mozart's Mass in C Minor during the storm at sea and the entrance into the harbor of Belleville. About how the creator was able to invest such meaning in those simple dark circles set behind thick lenses and the line of her mouth, which modulated between forthright resolve and a gentle satisfaction. The boy gets excited with the gift, and trained by Madame Souza along the years, he finally competes the Tour de France. What a wonderful surprise "" Les Triplettes de Belleville "" is!"
4680,"Thomas McCarthy's' The Station Agent' is a joyous and wondrous tale of three rather unique and quirky individuals whose lives intersect at an abandoned train depot in rural New Jersey. Somehow, through the trials and tribulations of daily living, these three strangers develop a bond of friendship, love and mutual support. The set - up for' The Station Agent' could have led to any number of serious pitfalls, given its potential for unbridled quirkiness and feel - good sentimentality However, McCarthy has managed to walk that fine line between preciousness and charm, contrivance and originality, calculation and spontaneity. ' The Station Agent' is a masterpiece of fine acting, with Peter Dinklage, Patricia Clarkson and Bobby Cannavale delivering pitch - perfect, bell - ringing performances. Peter Dinklage excels as a train enthusiast who thinks a move to the small train depot he inherits may afford him the peace and quiet he craves."
4681,"The movie has excellent acting, even though Dylan McDemorant looks more than a bit out of place in his biker-esque personia and goatee'ed bad boy personality. The soundtrack was also awesome - a fantastic mix of 70's B - side rock and obscure pop, spread out over a couple of hours in all the right places ala Boogie Nights. It does manage to create the feel of the early 80s that ended the craziness of the 70s. In spite of having a small role, Lisa Kudrow delivers the best performance. One such job was a robbery and murders at Laurel Canyon in 1981."
4677,"Aside from losing the woman he loved, Whitlock must now also contend with the mounting evidence putting him in the frame, especially when a nearby elderly neighbour (Evelyn Brooks) points him out as a suspect and a homicide squad, headed by his wife Alex (Eva Mendes) find evidence that suggests he was the new benificerary of Ann Marai's will. Though the performances are perfectly on par, a lot of the film's shortcomings are attributable to director Franklin, who allows the pace to become rather laxed and to lose it's sense of narrative structure in parts. Like many thrillers nowadays, he also allows credibility to be stretched fairly far in certain parts, requiring a rather huge and unreasonable suspension of disbelief from the audience. The movie's real strength lies in the twists and turns that they throw in from time to time. The direction is good and it really helps the film keep a good sense of pace in the way the camera spins around in even the office environment but really it is the cast that make this stand out from the many other crime thrillers that never make it to the cinema."
4678,"They vote him out and hire someone to replace him for an upcoming Battle of the Bands contest. When a call comes in to Ned asking him to serve as a substitute teacher at the prestigious Horace Green Elementary School, Dewey decides to assume his identity and take the job. Of course, faced with a class of fifth - graders all nicely clothed in their school uniforms, this rocker doesn't have a clue as to what to do. Dewey's spirits are lifted when he realizes that there are some talented musicians in the class including Zack (Joey Gaydos, Jr.), the lead guitarist; Katie (Rebecca Brown) on bass; and Lawrence (Robert Tsai) on keyboards. Freddy (Kevin Clark), the class rebel, turns out to be an eager learner on drums, and Tomika (Maryam Hassan) surprises him with her unusual singing talent."
4679,"Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, Eric Idle and Michael Palin from Monty Python and Pyton players Carol Cleveland and Neil Innes are joined by actor Tom Hanks for a classic Python sketch song. All three sections are worth watching but it is the third section that excels with musicians such as Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney, Tom Petty, Ringo Starr, Jeff Lynne, Billy Preston, and various others. Eric Clapton, Jeff Lynne and Dhani Harrison lead the assembled band through Harrison's best known songs and they are joined by Billy Preston, Tom Petty, Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney & Ravi Shankar (who wrote a beautiful indian piece for George). This is a good film with a great soundtrack that won a Grammy Award but it only saw a limited run in art house theaters and quickly disappeared from the big screen for DVD release. Photography is great, and the documentary aspect of the movie really unfolds into a bigger event that makes you feel that you are as much a part of the event as the musical stars themselves."
4682,"Lovers of great acting had best not pass up' Mystic River,' Clint Eastwood's powerful, award - laden adaptation of Dennis Lehane's best - selling novel. The Brian Helgeland screenplay makes the pain that each of these men experiences vivid and palpable. The grief Jimmy feels over the loss of his beloved child, the psychological torment Dave suffers as a result of his abuse, and the bewilderment and loneliness Sean experiences from a failed marriage all become integral to this dark tale of bitterness, revenge and attempted healing. Bacon is excellent as the man who attempts to put all the pieces together, not only of the case but of the shattered lives he and his two buddies have been living all these years, and Marcia Gay Harden is outstanding as Dave's loving wife who struggles with what is perhaps the greatest moral dilemma faced by any character in the movie. Linney, Lawrence Fishburne and Tom Guiry offer fine supporting performances."
4683,"There are people out there who will greenlight anything! Jammed into this ghastly disaster is a superabundance of gibberish dialogue, heinous acting, mumbo - jumbo exposition and zillions of clips from the once - popular arcade game of the same name. The actors seem like they're reading off cue cards as they constantly pause in the middle of long sentences and carry on talking as soon as they see the next card. See actual video game footage spliced into action scenes that make Ed Wood, Jr. look superior!"
4684,"With Clooney hired to represent her soon to be ex husband, he inevitably falls for the gold diggers charms. This delightful throwback to the Tracy - Hepburn, Grant - Russell comedies of the 30's and 40's moves at a nice pace and is anchored by a razor sharp performance by Clooney, who has rarely been more appealing on screen. One of the most underrated comedies ever made which is a definite must - see for Clooney fans. He's well known for an "" ironclad "" prenuptial agreement named after him and also known for taking his clients' spouses to the cleaners. The Wheezy Joe subplot was fun."
4685,"With complete disregard for the conventions of filmmaking, he paints an expressionistic masterpiece in his own unique style, the likes of which the world has never seen before. Simply amazing: 10 stars out of 10. However it was also so much more, with one of the great sections of the movie being presented in Japanese animation. The middle section of film was also great, as it tells the majority of the KB Vol. 1 story, although parts are pretty disturbing. As a fan of 70's martial arts movies, it was great to see all of the references."
4686,"Checkout Nicole Wilder as Machiko, you can't play cute and sensual any better than that. One of the movie's very good qualities is that it takes time to ponder this issue, whether love is only a chemical reaction or if it's something more. Thought John Livingston was excellent in his role as Rand, the computer genius who struggles with his feelings in real life. Rare independent film about the nature of love, is love and feelings all chemistry or are humans blessed with something special that no other animal has? Overall worth seeing, with some excellent parts, as well as some inconsistencies in quality of scenes."
4687,"However, there is something a bit' off' with it: It seems to take place in the 1970's and there is some hint about the "" Bicentenniel Room "". This is no' Priscilla, Queen of the Desert', with Patrick Swayze & Wesley Snipes acting all swishy, these are men who honestly look & sound like real women - and they are playing "" straight women "", as in, you have to go into this believeing they are real women and forget they're really men underneath the wigs & dresses, okay? Very funny, with great "" drama Queen "" moments, temper tantrums and bitch - slaps! Plotnick is quite humorous, dropping the most mean - spirited one - liners you'll ever laugh at, and the clips of Evie performing in the 60's stinker "" Asteroid "" resemble nothing less than Morgan Fairchild on quaaludes. Leupp reprises the role of Coco from his scene - stealing moments in the movie "" Trick "", and he imbues the character both with a humorous sense of bad luck and an immediately sympathetic personality."
4688,"He is closely challenged however by both Cusack and Weisz who give admirable performances in their respective roles. Leading you in multiple directions, the constant game of' cat and mouse' is brilliantly played out with some noticeable surprises as well as some rather unexpected ones. Hackman, Weisz and Cusack are all on top form for this one, but Hoffman's Character seemed to lack a little depth. Cusack is able to do almost anything, Hoffman and Hackman are always reliable actors and sexy Weisz is perfect as the mysterious Marlee. It's a great way to spend two hours of your time, especially with the great performances of Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz to keep you glued to what is happening but the movie has a lot of glaring problems that makes it hard to sit though in certain parts."
4689,"Well - filmed, well - acted, suspensful, with good characters. The casting of Lee Ermey as the sheriff is icing on the cake; he definitely brought the movie up a few notches. Obviously the film had some advantages from a bigger budget, and R. Lee Ermey is definitely worth watching."
4690,"And it's enjoyable on many different levels--it's funny, charming, weird, intelligent, and it has a real honest heart to it that isn't nearly sentimental or gushing. "" Pieces of April "" is a wonderful New York component for a trilogy of mordant but ultimately sweet holiday movies, along with the Parisian "" La Buche "" and the multi-ethnic L. A. "" What's Cooking . "" The characters who embark on parallel picaresque odysseys in a quaintly but believably diverse Lower East Side tenement and suburbs to city road trip are refreshingly individual and un-stereotyped in surprising directions, even if the actors may overdo the theatrical flourishes. So if you want to see this movie because you expect some good laughs, don't see it. And at least those made - for - TV - flicks have better camera - work than this."
4708,"One of the unsung and unheralded movie treasures of 2003,' Shattered Glass' tells the fascinating story of Stephen Glass, one of the top reporters for The New Republic in the 1990's, who rocked the media world when he had to finally confess that he had fabricated many of his stories. Glass was only 24 when he fell from grace; prior to that, he was a hot shot reporter who, in the highly competitive world of high stakes journalism, kept looking for that little added edge to make his stories saleable. In addition to Christensen, the film is filled with brilliant, subtle performances by Peter Sarsgaard, Chloe Sevigny, Hank Azaria and many others. Superbly written and directed by Billy Ray,' Shattered Glass' is one of the most suspenseful films of recent times, far more gripping than most so - called thrillers because the film is dealing with real - world issues of integrity and ethics. How such unseasoned writers came to play so prominent a part in so major and venerable a publication is indeed one of the great mysteries of the story - and one of the sharpest indictments leveled against the magazine by the makers of the film."
4691,"moment by moment she projects her feelings thoughts. Director Christine Jeffs brings a raw intensity to many of the confrontation scenes involving the pain - wracked, benighted couple. A more adventurous structure, with glimpses of childhood, early years, etc might have added much needed lyricism to this lackluster project. The film moves quickly through the years, showing how, after a short period of relative marital bliss, Ted's philandering began to take its toll on the relationship. The relationship came across as quite two dimensional, and even pretty one sided on the part of Paltrow / Plath."
4692,"Blanchett definitely breathes life into the Guerin character with phenomenal credibility and vitality, allowing her personality to shine with such unique journalistic dedication, honesty, courage, determination and obsession. cate blanchet is superb and its sad that it took her death for the irish gorvernment to do something. Cate Blanchett has done it again - played someone you can't take your eyes off of, and not because she's a classic beauty but she's just a good actress and plays such intense roles. The film has the right speed in presenting all the facts, it is simple and well acted - Cate Blanchett's performance is outstanding. And this is one of the few movies to give an accurate impression of Irish natives, cultures, accents etc. ."
4693,"She and Mark Ruffalo give the most stunning lead performances for a long time. Not goody - goodies or baddy - baddies. Admittedly it's not the strongest point in the film, but it has all the required shocks and surprises (and, you'd think enough gore for the modern audience), and while the revelation of the murderer is not the biggest twist ending ever, the final shot takes your breath away. And how much of love involves physicality, carnality, trust, the desire to dominate, the desire to be dominated, and above all, the attraction of the DANGEROUS. Mark Ruffalo is excellent as the cop who may be more of a threat to Frannie than the killer who's terrorizing the area."
4694,"First of all, Gooding's and Harris's performances were simply spectacular, especially Gooding. The scenes between Jones and this woman, lovingly played by S. Epatha Merkerson, are some of the finest in the film. Alfre Woodard, another good actress plays the high school principle with style. For all its heavy handed manipulation, however,' Radio' turns out to be a pretty decent little film due, primarily, to the superb performances by Ed Harris and Cube Gooding Jr., and to the fact that the movie doesn't overplay its hand as often as it might. The film does an effective job conveying the incredulous reactions of many of the otherwise well - meaning town folk, as even Radio's own mother asks Joe why he is doing what he's doing."
4695,"' Scary Movie 3' is a much more enjoyable fair than the first two movies. When they poke fun, they are poking fun not at life, but at the movies. With some famous actors like Charlie Sheen and Leslie Nielsen, who both have a solid record full of humorous TV - series and / or movies, you know that you can expect the best of the best again when it comes to this kind of humor. The most popular complaints seem to be that the trailer ruined the film by "" giving away the good parts "" and that the film has fun at the expense of some people's sacred cows. Get an idea for the genres, directors, actors and so on that you usually enjoy."
4696,"This feature requires several viewings to understand and to catch the symmetry and depth of the story within the story. The secret and beauty of this feature is to look beyond the classic Disney story and focus on the sub-text being used and you'll discover a deeper more inspiring story framed within the classic Disney formula. That's right, the songs are strongly tied to the sub-story. This is a hint that this story is not what is seems as the Inuit's, Bears, Mammoths, Moose, and Rams are really metaphors for other things. As far as sequels go, it will be hard to improve on a masterpiece."
4697,"The director has drawn fine work from his cast of talented unknowns. For them there are plenty of mindlessly upbeat depictions of high school life to watch. It only spans maybe an hour in time, but it coves the points of view of a lot of people, from victims to bystanders to the murderers themselves. As one of the murderers tells the other at the beginning of the rampage, ` Have fun."
4698,"As the bombastic hospital psychologist figures out, Dan's illness is essentially psychosomatic in nature, one rooted in his inability to accept the realities of life in his own skin. Still, towards the end of the film, when Dan starts to make some profound psychological breakthroughs, the fantasy scenes actually do begin to work and the complex structure pays off. Gibson has a great deal of fun playing the part of a paunchy, balding psychiatrist whose unorthodox methods wind up getting to the root of his belligerent patient's troubles. Robin Wright Penn, Jeremy Northam, Adrian Brody, Katie Homes and Alfre Woodard among others all deliver top notch supporting performances. In "" The Singing Detective "" there are moments of pure "" Yes! """
4707,"Yes, the movie adequately presents scenes from Silk's past to expose his secret, but some of the supporting characters are left dangling in the present. There is a lot of nuance in the way the scenes are filmed and the way in which the actors are framed. Ed Harris is only on - screen for a few minutes, but he manages to shine, especially in a key scene with Sinise at the end. Just the looks on his face alone are fascinating in this film. The pasts of the main protagonists unfold, making their characters exceptionally deep."
4719,"there is some great camera work and some really interesting ideas but gothika doesn't have some of the subtle touches that What Lies Beneath had, but its easy to see some of the parallels between the two films. all in all, gothika provides a good story, an average screen play and enough innovative ideas to keep its audience. The setting and atmosphere that is created in Gothika is excellent, and the movie is definitely creepy enough to jangle your nerves. It's a tight, disturbing psychological / supernatural thriller which, though a little predictable at times, nevertheless offers some frightening imagery and a few good solid scares. Gothika is easily the best of the lot, and also the darkest."
4709,His voice is not the perfect voice due to its monotonous tone but his body language is very good and sometimes even great and that is the case in Revolutions as well. As most people know Gloria Foster died before finishing her scenes for Revolutions and thus a different actress was cast to take over. Most of the secondary cast from Reloaded returns in their parts in Revolutions and they all do decent jobs with their characters. Harry J. Lennix (Lock) improved his character tremendously in spite of limited screen time. Hugo Weaving still provides the best acting in the film and steals every one of his regrettably limited number of scenes.
4710,"which brings up another point: if Chavez is the master propagandist so many here are claiming, why wouldn't he have a couple of his Venezuelan supporters post a couple of entries to balance the scales a bit? There's a coup d'etat and a couple of irish documentary filmmakers are right inside of it. The documentary is a historical masterpiece, shot from the center of the action, acute and totally embarrassing for the prime supporters of the coup: The good, democratic, freedom loving, benevolent USA (who still channel large amounts of money to Chavez' political opponents). Perhaps the strongest point of the documentary is that it never explicitly blames the U. S., but instead allows the viewer to draw their own conclusions."
4711,"Elf was a hilarious movie about a guy named Buddy (Will Ferrel), who was raised by elves at the North Pole. Ferrell is a natural performer and his dopey wide eyed expressions never grow old. Ferrell gives an inspired lunacy turn as a man who was raised by elves at The North Pole and discovers to his dismay he's actually human sparking his quest to be re-united with his long - lost father (Caan in an inspired bit of casting), a' naughty - list' occupant, who works as a children's book publisher in New York City, just in time for Christmas. Directed with style and witty warmth by Favreau (who has a cameo) and written by newcomer David Berenbaum with a smart, fun script that caters to all ages with a nostalgic nod to classic animated holiday specials for good measure. Charming Christmas confection--about a boy raised by elves in the North Pole who grows up and journeys to N. Y. C. in search of his biological father--puts a clever spin on even the most familiar gags, successfully walking a fine line between absurdist comedy and holiday schmaltz."
4713,"One of the storylines, one that is cited constantly in reviews as one of the failed storylines with a sad ending is actually bittersweet. It makes a statement: "" love actually is all around "" then shows why it makes that statement and doesn't attempt to do or be anything else. And like the fact it covers different kinds of love, it covers different attitudes and portrayals of it - so a couple are realistic, a couple are classic fantasy, a couple are pure comedy and a couple are pure rom - com tradition. One character's unrequited love is revealed as a noble sacrifice made for another's happiness (the method of finally achieving closure and moving on, however, could only work in the movies). A lot of the reviews here have disparaged the movie because they thought it was too glib about love and very unrealistic."
4715,"The movie is full of interviews, many quite wise and spiritual. It's the cumulative effect of the interviews, plus the fine photography and the brilliant editing, that all add up to an extraordinary portrait of a great artist and a flawed but complex man. So 25 years after his father's death, at the age of 36, Nathaniel set out to make this film to find out who his father was - and he has done an amazing and triumphant job. ' Wares then speaks about Kahn's achievement and character. Nathaniel ` interviews' the great buildings, too, most beautifully and movingly."
4716,"At the heart of which is the conflict inside Capt. "" Lucky "" Jack Aubry (Russel Crowe) who balances his duty to the British Empire and his personal relationships with friends and crew members on board the HMS Surprise. The amazing attention to detail and the tremendous acting were on par with, if not in great excess of Donaldson's "" The Bounty "", where Mel Gibson and Tony Hopkins gave mind altering performances. It would have been easy for the director to read through the salty notes of previous period pieces and deliver the usual tale of ocean going brutality and scurvy encrusted woe but Peter Weir's version of order through respect and camaraderie is far more believable especially when you realize that the sailor's greatest enemy was the ocean itself. Director Peter Weir has created an intriguing film that nicely balances fierce battle sequences with quiet, intimate scenes. The adaptation by Weir and John Colley is right on target, brimming with great characters and scenes."
4717,"In other frontier movies unmarried cohabitation is either flaunted or causes great anxiety and guilt for the participants. But here, the characters of Cate Blanchett and Aaron Eckhart realistically consider their behavior to be decent and civilized. Kilmer's character embodies that great grayness of real life that Western movies try to clarify as black and white. Otherwise, even if he was successful in his mission, he would've been simply more powerful than the villain, or luckier, and neither of those are moral qualities. Nope, he captains supernatural forces that most viewers normally associate with wolfmen, vampires and so on."
4718,"Not even the kids liked this one folks, and kids laugh at anything now. When Myers picks up a garden hoe and delivers to the camera: "" dirty ho "", everything but the rim shot was missing, and even that wouldn't have helped. Dakota Fanning was the only actor who seemed to be aware she was in a movie based on a Dr. Seuss classic, and stayed true to the genre. Dr. Seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for a very good reason. Or, show them the "" Horton Hears a Who "" animated classic from the 70s."
4720,"What follows is both a comic and a touching critique of the achievements of socialism. Money gets Remy out of an overcrowded ward, it gets him the most accurate medical tests and the "" painkillers "" he needs to survive. But "" Barbarian Invasions "" is critical of both systems: there is a beautiful scene where an auctioneer visits an old Montreal priest who takes her to the basement where he apparently has statuettes and chalices he wants to sell. What follows is a profound and touching elegy to the stupidities of youth, the mistakes in life, the regret and acceptance of old age - in other words of humanity. It's ironic, as a side - note, that this film came out roughly at the same time as Bertolucci's "" The Dreamers, "" which is essentially a contemplation on the idealism and romanticism of French socialism and the "" free love "" culture of the 60s."
4721,"But the acting is superb, the script hysterical, and the unbelievable jokes and inappropriate situations are just so entertaining you won't care about anything else. He drinks and smokes and pukes and wets his pants and has sex in public places. The concept of the movie is simple and the script is razor sharp with well drawn characters enhanced by faultless performances throughout. As with all good comedies, the material is inspired but it's the delivery that makes it unforgettable. His performance alone would be enough to make this film good but the fact that his high standards are maintained by the rest of the cast elevates it to a classic."
4722,"What genius thought up this lame script? Sure, they toss in a dozen homages to the original ride, but Disney flubbed a golden opportunity to create a classic film. ' The Haunted Mansion,' a film' inspired' by the Disney theme - park attraction of the same name, feels like a cross between' The Haunting' and' The Ghost and Mr. Chicken . ' Then her husband and kids have an adventure involving ghosts and a talking crystal ball. Rick Baker "" Monster Maker "" is so talented and has done an impressive (as always) job creating a vision from the Haunted Mansion ride that he also admired."
4723,"The story boils down to a pretty standard chase and explosion thriller set in the middle ages. Some people blame the fact that you have to put a 300 pages book into a 2 hour film, but Jurassic Park did fine and, thou the theme is totally different, the writing / plot style is pretty the same. Even the "" pure french people "" seem to be able to understand English: p Why didn't they do some research (why research, it's all in the book) on the languages? To find something from someone you know in the present and know that it is over 600 years old and then discovering that he is stranded in an earlier time is very intriguing. Overall the acting was good, however Paul Walker would probably benefit from a few more classes."
4853,"The catch is that the whole procedure will take three years. Despite some reluctance, he agrees to the deal and when the three years pass by, Jennings, thinking he's a rich man, is shocked to discover he gave up over ninety million dollars in favor of an envelope containing twenty everyday household items. What might work in movies that establish their characters as supercops with impeccable aims doesn't come off quite as well in action scenes that feature scientists beating up a large number of armed goons. The film chronicles Affleck's collection of simple, every day items that have been sent to him by - himself - and each has a purpose he must soon discover. Director John Woo mixes lots of gritty, sometimes over-blown action sequences here and there (especially at the end), but they only enhanced the suspenseful nature of the film."
4836,"Baldwin has always been an underrated actor - at the start of his career, the big studios made the mistake of trying to market him as a star, rather than as the quality actor that he is. He is also helped by working alongside another great actor, William H Macy, who can do more with a look than most can do with 6 OR 7 pages of dialogue (See the scene when he realizes Maria Bello is still in his flat). It's good to see that films like The Cooler and 21 Grams are doing well and being recognised - it is a triumph for acting and strong scripts as opposed to continual FX and CGI in modern cinema. Wonderful performances all over, especially by Baldwin and Macy. "" - lines like these are going to come out goofy, even from the mouths of great actors."
4838,"Missy Elliott is genuinely funny in her very brief scenes. To be honest, the movie pretty much goes in one ear and out the other; there's not a single truly dramatic moment, with the setbacks coming on cue (when Li'l Romeo's character gets arrested it, and many other moments in the movie, plays like a less - than - brilliant After School Special) and the characters are right out of Cliches Central, from the almost saintly title character to the sexually predatory rival dancer. This isn't really the best vehicle for her, to be honest, but Jessica's an undeniable charmer on screen, and far too sexy for this or anything she's been in (with the arguable exception of "" Paranoid "") to be an unbearable experience. The dancing scenes are really tight, the casting has been done beautifully especially casting Jessica Alba. The dancing's also good, which is one of the main reasons to go and see movies like this; and though it doesn't actually seem to have anything like a narrative drive (it just seems to end instead of climax), there have been worse movies from music video directors, e. g. almost anything directed by Russell Mulcahy."
4839,"During the first attack on the Samurai, Allgren is captured by the Samurai and begins a spiritual, physical and philosophical journey which will bring him a level of self - respect his own culture could never supply. Ultimately, this beautifully shot film conveys powerful messages about war, tradition, ethics, honor and culture, which, though not particularly original, are sensitively and intelligently brought forward. The action, sets, scenery and story - even the dialogue - were riveting. Clearly, a ton of historical and cultural research and care went into the script, sets, costumes, casting. Rarely does a movie have excellent acting across the board, but all the Japanese actors were outstanding, and the Americans and Europeans were excellent."
4840,"Ewan McGregor is pure sunshine and Albert Finney gives one of the greatest performances of the year - he * is * Big Fish. The texture is same of grandmother's tales in Christamas Eve or Sunday morning. A brave hero, strange village, temptation and huge love, success and discoveries, miracles and public, secret sense of life and courage. The others are, in great measure, parts of funny miracle and ineffable expectation. Nuances, accents, inflexion of words, smile or gestures are bricks of a magnificent character, touching, warm, credible."
4841,"Erica, though brilliant and attractive, has pretty much shut herself off from the dating scene since her divorce a number of years ago. Despite their diametrically opposed outlooks on love and romance, Erica and Harry spend quality time together, discover their ultimate compatibility, and eventually fall in love. Meyers has written a witty, sophisticated screenplay that offers insights into any number of' battle of the sexes' issues. When he so unexpectedly finds his head turned by a vibrant, attractive and intelligent woman in her 50's, Harry, a middle - aged Lothario who finds he needs Viagra to help him keep pace with his youthful' conquests,' is forced to re-evaluate what has hitherto been the defining philosophy of his personality and lifestyle. In addition to these two outstanding performers, the film boasts excellent supporting work from Frances McDormand as Erica's pragmatic, clear - headed sister; Amanda Peet as Erica's level - headed daughter; and Keanu Reeves as Harry's handsome young doctor who finds himself smitten by Erica's mature beauty and charm."
4842,"And their hometown accepts them and then loves them as they grow up dealing with their conjoinededness. It never makes fun of the conjoined twins really, just the people they have to deal with to get ahead in life. That also gives Stuck On You a slightly more serious edge, but one that works very well. If you are familiar with Daisy and Violet Hilton's story, for example--they were infamous sideshow performers who were conjoined twins--you'll note similarities, such as how they approached relationships with persons of the opposite sex. The Farrelly Brothers' "" Stuck On You "" is sincere drama with lots of heart--of course, along with their smart quips and earnest observations not diminishing."
4843,"The film is breathtaking alone in the fact that the production team, led by cinematographer Eduardo Serra, production designer Ben Van Os, and art director Christina Shaeffer, manages to capture Vermeer's filling, oil - based colors, and light into every scene. Much of the film's premise is true: Vermeer was a reticent and brilliant painter who attempted to balance his genius and deep - rooted, innate calling to art and solitude with the often overbearing demands of a bourgeoisie, Venetian society, as well as the malignant pressures posted by a sadistic commissioner, and the pressures of being the head of a massive household (when he died in 1675, he left behind his wife and 11 children). Enter a young, beautiful servant girl, Grit (Scarlett Johansson), who through no fault of her own, finds that her classic beauty attracts Vermeer's sensibilities - as a man and as an artist - to such a degree that he has no choice but to capture her on oil and canvas. There's great symbolism in many of these shots - his body is often half - covered, half - exposed, representing the dichotomy he must have felt in his life - that of being in perpetual conflict with his spiritual, artistic longings and the more human qualities of a man. Whereas Vermeer' silence is a result of his being reluctant to communicate with the external world, mostly due to artistic self - absorption, Griet similarly is cut off from humanity, but rather out of innocence, naivety, beauty, and the unfortunate side effect of being at the low end of a rather oppressive Delft caste system where she has little voice outside of the disturbance her beauty stimulates in others."
4844,""" The Statement "" deserves far better ratings than critics have given it. Michael Caine is superb in the leading role, and Tilda Swinton and Jeremy Northam are excellent as the judge and army colonel who are trying to bring him to justice while those who formerly hid him seek to execute him, blaming a non-existent group of Jewish vigilantes. He enjoyed the patronage of the French clergy, who took pains in keeping him out of the inquiring eye of groups trying to bring into justice the war criminals. In fact, he surprises in the way he can disappear into the monasteries where Brossard feels welcome. Ciaran Hands, Frank Finlay, Charlotte Rampling, Alan Bates, among others, help make this thriller look real."
4845,"He has created an all - encompassing epic saga of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings books, and after coming away from the final chapter, how does this rate not only as a film on its own, but as a part of the whole? A trilogy of movies created with such love and care and utter perfection of craft that you can't help but walk away and wonder how did Peter Jackson make this possible? The battles are monumentally huge and exciting. And gives a good - bye to friends seen on screen for the last three years. It was truly a bittersweet feeling in realizing that there will be no "" Rings "" movie in 2004."
4846,"Certainly those young women, so well dressed for classes, talking back to her in well thought out sentences full of vitriol were figments of Hollywood's imagination. What was wonderful, however, was being with all women, being able to speak up freely in class, being able to win positions of authority in extra curricular organizations like the college newspaper. Julia Roberts plays an art history professor who takes a teaching position at the all - female Wellesly College in the 1950s. Well, if its liberal to want young ladies to consider all their options and be able to reach for the stars - if they choose, then who can disagree."
4847,""" The women of Yorkshire are like the flowers of Yorkshire in the last state of their lives they look best . "" Calendar Girls is brilliantly performed and directed, and it has many heart wrenching tales that lie beneath the main story, each pertaining to the girls own reasons and drives to fight for what eventually became a mammoth success. One of the most delightful films of recent years, ` Calendar Girls,' a distaff version of ` The Full Monty,' is the true story of a group of middle - aged English women who became international celebrities when they designed and posed for a nude fundraising calendar that sold millions of copies worldwide. The calendar becomes well succeeded, making them famous and affecting their lives. It's one of those British comedies that has few laughs, but is very lighthearted and has some serious drama in it."
4848,"It was the pre-Powerpoint age but all briefers were admonished to either have facts best supported by charts and numbers or to simply confess ignorance. Gifted documentarian Errol Morris's "" Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara "" is a vital and presciently timely examination of a past that can repeat itself with incalculable harm to the United States. Interpolating documentary film clips from World War II through Vietnam with excerpts from an extensive interview with McNamara, the camera always focused on the alert, articulate and still (controllingly) brilliant eighty - six year old former secretary, Morris quickly takes viewers through his early life getting quickly to World War II. Interesting and important as McNamara's early war activities were, the crux of his life and the undying source of charge, defense and recrimination is his stewardship of the Defense Department during the early and mid years of the Vietnam conflict. Morris is probably the finest, from an intellectual standpoint, documentarian working today in the U. S. 10/10 (because of its enduring archival and current thought - provoking value)"
4849,"First of all, anyone who says that s / he didn't "" get the point of this movie "" needs to go back to watching movies produced solely by Jerry Brukheimer because the point could not be more apparent to anyone of any intelligence. While Behrani's main motive is to protect his family and give it a sense of security, Lester puts his own selfish pleasures before the wellbeing of his own family. Behrani and Lester are complete opposites, Behrani clearly the nobler. This movie is undoubtedly the best of many good ones in the past years. The cinematography was beyond beautiful; indescribably glorious, breathtakingly exquisite in both the colors and movement."
4850,"If Oscar means anything anymore, she deserves that award, hands - down. At the core there's the amazing performance from Charlize Theron, who's deserving of all the praises and the awards she got. The mood swings Charlize Theron portrays are perfect, as are the mannerisms, body language, clothes, teeth, complexion, hair, the body fat, manner of speaking, that strutting walk and just everything. The fact that she was played by the glamorous, beautiful, Charlize Theron on top of it, was beyond all comprehension. She's willing to do anything to provide for the first person that ever loved her."
4851,"Well this also was not a patch on the original, but that said there was nothing wrong with Steve Martin's performance; he does well with the material as indeed do all the performers. In fact this is well directed, and a fine film technically: it is just that the script is unbelievably awful (warning there may be slight spoilers): - This is a film about family values, yet it has been written by people who clearly don't understand family values. The major calamities, the scenes of complete mayhem, these at least rang true, but where was the aftermath: the parents seemed to accept it as there lot to be the butt of their children's nasty pranks. While the CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN opening titles credit the authors of the best - selling book the original 1950 film was based on (Frank B. Gilbreth Jr. and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey), don't expect to see a remake of the charming, early - 20th century comedy about two efficiency experts (Clifton Webb and Myrna Loy) running a complex but happy family. The film was such a success that two sequels were made, and Webb would do several more' family' comedies before his death in 1966."
4852,"Anthony Mingheller's astounding film cleverly sweeps the audience into the horrors of war at its beginning. This is an absolutely fabulous movie that portrays the stunning performances of its stellar cast of actors and the overwhelming raw landscapes that are kept in sync with their events and moods. It's fascinating to watch the couple adapt to situations beyond their control and to study the emotional and behavioral attitudes of two human beings altering at such opposing magnitude as a result of one war. That, indeed, is beautifully captured by the expressions on Law and Kidman's faces. The symbolisms, throughout the film, are plentiful and brilliantly ascribed, allowing the audience to join the dots to the destinies of the couple."
4854,"Such sage wisdom ye shall not find in other reviews. The relationship of these two pre-teens is as complex as any two adults in any other movies. There are some moments that are literally breathtaking. This film deserves to be a classic and is one of the best fantasy movies to date. Enter December 2003, and P. J. Hogan's retelling of the classic tale that hit theatres amongst all the Oscar hopefuls and faded from memory before recouping even half of its reported $100 million dollar budget."
4855,"Altman did a fine job depicting dance, both rehearsals and performances. The movie is a montage of scenes of "" reactive behavior "" among realistic characters, and in this it is more like real life than a more structured story would have been. But the dancers, being good soldiers, follow his orders diligently. Lets hope that Altman makes films for another 20 years and that he stays as adventuresome as he currently is. This is most of all about himself, and is far, far more intelligent and subtle than say,' Blowup . '"
4856,"The idea that Bush's competency hearing lasting 15 minutes just makes matters worse. The documentary ` Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer' provides an interesting companion piece to ` Monster,' the film that earned Charlize Theron the Academy Award for Best Actress of 2003. But the most compelling scenes are those in which he interviews Aileen herself, prodding her to open up and reveal whether she committed the murders out of self - defense as she claims or whether she killed her victims to steal their money as the prosecution successfully argued. This is the second documentary that film - maker Nick Broomfield has made about Wuornos. The film deals with Wuornos' horrific background and also with the various hearings and appeals to try to save her life."
4859,"The quote by Shariati is in fact very suggestive, and ambiguous in the context of the movie. A powerful and disturbing film of what life was like under the oppressive Taliban rule. The fact that she wishes that God had never created women, rather than wishing something a little more logical, like that God had never created the Taliban, serves to bring into sharp focus the extent to which the Taliban have perverted these women's minds. The local Taliban, however, remembers this little detail very clearly, and starts by hosing the women down with high - pressure hoses before opening fire on them. The other child actor, Arif Herati, who played the one who tried to shield her from trouble by the other boys, gave a brief but convincing Espandi."
4871,"There's also the uber - likable Maura Tierney along with Laura Kightlinger, to pepper this low - budget indy with a some bankable star power. No, it's not quite "" Swingers "" but it's very good, with solid performances that come from a unique ensemble chemistry (these guys did this thing on stage for five months). Somewhere between TV pap and movie crap, independent films like this, made on the cheap but sparing little or nothing in the quality of writing / performance, offer some hope for viewers who want something more. Four people, two guys and two gals, at different places in their lives, chance to meet at a restaurant for dinner one day, and end up revealing themselves and discovering each other in ways none of them could have predicted. Appearances by Jack Black, David Cross, and Bob Odenkirk are well - placed within the various stories that unfold."
4896,"In the mid-80's two young climbers attempted to reach the summit of Siula Grande in Peru - a feat that had previously been attempted but never achieved. Yet another reason to lament the closing of Film Four's doors, this film is the cinematic equivalent of sitting listening to someone tell you an amazing story in their own words. The running time is generous and allows Simon to tell his story properly, it is amazing and the sense of impossible odds and the sheer pain involved is brought to the audience very well - even with a handful of people in the audience gasps and' ah' s' were very audible. The story of what happens when two British climbers try to reach the top of a previous unclimbed mountain is one of the most spellbinding films in years. A hybrid of talking heads and re-enactments this movie is one of the best films (on mountain climbing) ever made."
4899,"And much better than the other gay movie offering that year - The Fluffer. Though excommunications are held in well - lit rooms with nice big desks and chairs, it was totally appropriate to portray it as the dark, cold scene they did in this film. The nude scenes were superbly crafted as well, and all in were good taste. Supporting co-star Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with her one liners."
4901,"Isabelle, Theo and Matthew are so insulated and cut off from the outside world that the points Bertolucci seemingly wants to make about the times - as reflected in protesters marching in the streets, the references to Vietnam, Mao and Jimmy Hendrix - feel tacked on and superfluous, not particularly integral to the film as a whole. His characters live, breathe and think films, often acting out favorite scenes while the director intercuts snippets from the movies themselves. The film, in many ways, becomes an homage to Chaplin and Keaton, Astaire and Rogers, Samuel Fuller, Truffaut, Godard, Greta Garbo and many other icons of movie history. ' The Dreamers' doesn't entirely hold together and the sum of its parts is better than the whole. Bertolucci is a true film artist and it is a joy just to sit and watch what he does with his actors and his camera, like a master painter working wonders with his canvas."
4906,"The honesty of the main characters cutting problems is absolutely both terrifying and breath taking. True the movie does show a girl experimenting with drugs and sex but it also taps into the emotional and psychological problems that drive kids today to do so. It is honest and terrifying, for some they can relate to the pain, frustration, and confusion that the main character goes through but for others it can serve as an eye - opening view of what that life is like. There is so much passion, so much realistic drama, you will relive your teenage years. The bottom line is, "" Thirteen "" is a great, realistic, disturbing urban drama that you should watch with an open mind and with knowledge that it is based in fact."
4922,"As he recreates history to incorporate current events, he softens the harshness of the party rhetoric, reforming the socialistic ideal closer to the compassion for the masses and the acceptance of the' enemy' capitalists. But as Alex fabricates news reports and artifacts for the illusion he's providing his mother, he actually appears to be inventing a system of socialism that he can feel proud of. Filmmakers worldwide have since explored the causes and effects of the German Reunification, and even today, they continue to bring new insight and a fresh perspective to an event that occurred nearly fifteen years ago. Just as Rip Van Winkle slept through the American Revolution and woke up twenty years later to find himself a citizen of a brand new country, so Kathrin Sass, an East German woman, slips into a coma on the eve of the fall of the Berlin Wall only to wake up eight months later a member of a capitalist society. While she is' asleep,' governments tumble, barriers crumble and a whole new tide of Western goods and values comes flooding eastwards to a ravenous, eagerly awaiting public."
4945,"A true masterpiece - one of the few pure pieces of art in cinema with amazing acting from Nicole Kidman especially, and the lack of a set causes you to be immersed in the characters like no other movie. Dogville is a small mountain village outside of George Town; it is a tight community of good people who look after each other. It's a movie that, like all brilliant movies, has themes that transcend into society as a whole. "" Dogville "" begins with a prologue and extends to nine chapters in almost three hours of daring, exquisite film - making. She's a beautiful young American who, apparently on the run from gangsters, hides herself in a small Colorado town called Dogville, helped by Tom (Paul Bettany) and the other residents."
4946,"If you read up the actual history behind most movies based on historical figures, there is usually a huge difference between the fact and the fictional portrayal. And they are the details of the story that are best discovered by reading the different viewpoints given by the various historians. When you consider some other movies that are far worse than this one, your opinion of this movie should be reconsidered. There have been quite a number of films based on heroic legends."
4954,"What really makes this movie are the beautiful shots of Southern Italy, where golden fields go as far as the eye can see. The screenplay is perfect, developing the characters and disclosing the secrets through the innocent eyes of a ten years old boy, having a sensational plot point, in a wonderful landscape and a very sentimental soundtrack. The performances of Giuseppe Cristiano, in a beautiful and morally strong character, and Mattia Di Pierro, in the role of a defenseless victim, are awesome. This awarded "" Io non ho Paura "" is an unforgettable gem to be discovered by lovers of a great cinema. This film shows the stark contrast of the two worlds by interweaving them, with childhood itself being one of the main characters, as landscapes were for John Ford in so many of his Westerns."
4977,"He made friends with a lot of the inmates, and learned a lot of their personal stories. The film still has some great direction though, Hector Babenco has a leisurely style (matched by his actual output, it's been 7 years since his last film, and nearly 20 since' Ironweed'), allowing the story the space it needs to breathe but still picking up the pace to build tension. If this film and' City of God' are to believed drug - dealing thieving murderers all have their hearts in the right place and are all okay guys who just took a wrong turn on the road. The last 20 minutes really smacked that home, but with the closing shots of the prison finally being demolished in 2002 you feel like there was at least some sort of closure on the tragedy. The story is harrowing, but heart - warming, and the acting (mostly from unknowns) is top rate."
4978,"This may be one of the funniest movies you've ever seen in which no one cracks a smile. Then there's the one where Tom Waits and Iggy Pop meet in a dive bar to discuss things and have a smoke (to celebrate quitting smoking), Jack and Meg White of the White Stripes experimenting with a Tesla coil, and in the funniest casting, RZA and GZA of the Wu - Tang Clan sharing some downtime with, of all people, Bill Murray. If those three had been taken out, "" Coffee and Cigarettes "" would be just about perfect, but it's still really good. Straight - faced, deadpan, B&W comedy just like "" Strangers In Paradise "". But as it goes on, and strange connections are made between the stories, it seems to have a sudden dreamlike depth to it."
5039,"All achieved through the intimate and profound struggles of the film's characters. Thanks to this masterpiece, Marco Tullio Giordana enters the Gotha of Masters of the "" Made in Italy "" production. In "" La miglior Gioventu' "" Marco Tullio Giordana attempts something quite ambitious: a "" Novecento part 3 "" covering nearly 40 years of Italian history from 1966 to the present day. Like in the "" Hundred Steps "" the first shots are of hope, with a great imitation of the Technicolor years and the skies of Rome with the "" House of the Rising Sun "" in the background. How vain is that sacrifice appears clearer in the first part of the Best of Youth, where Nicola gradually diverges from her partner Giulia, soon to disappear in the clandestine world of terrorist subversions of the "" lead years . """
5067,"A visual feast for the eyes & the heart. Stilgar and Duncan fit perfectly and Jessica is at least Saskia Reeves match. com); better acting in general, especially Alice Krige as Lady Jessica and the young actor who played Leto, son of Paul; better special effects (incredible sandworms!) At the heart of it is Princess Wensicia (Susan Sarandon), daughter of Emperor Shaddam IV and sister of Irulan (Julie Cox). Alec Newman, who was very good in the original, has matured the past three years, his performance as Paul Atreides is excellent."
5113,"There are also a few successful surprise - scares in it. The best thing is to just watch this movie without knowing anything about it. Though several of the scenes clearly give away just a teensy bit too much information, once you've seen the film, it's nice to see how they actually further support the psychological intentions of the filmmakers yet, at the same time, had to go.) ' A Tale of Two Sisters', or' Janghwa, Hongryeon', is a true masterpiece. After that, the flashback scene ties it all together in terms of how both the stepmother was mainly responsible for her death, while Su - Mi unintentionally played a supporting role."
5126,"The remarkable natural setting which reflects the wide spectrum of Korea's seasons, which range from hot, sticky humid - fraught summers to icy, cold snow - bound winters, become a metaphor of life with unadorned figures, completely human in form. This film is a pastoral poem about the changing seasons and a meditation on the cycle of life. And though the changing of the seasons in the film is to show the life of one monk, Kim says it reflects the cycle of life in general."" Set against the background of this floating monastery, the picture's only set, the film follows the lives of a child monk and his master through four different seasons of their lives. Each of the' seasons' of the film are handled delicately, with the kind of simplicity that may appeal even more to children (the segment of the first' spring' with the child transcends religion and goes into the basic stance of nature)."
5147,""" The Inheritance (Arven) "" is the best look since "" The Godfather "" at the corrosive impact of family business where there's no boundaries between family and business. Christoffer (Ulrich Thomsen) has escaped his Danish family and is comfortably ensconced in Stockholm as a successful restaurateur, living with the beautiful actress Maria (Lisa Werlinder) whose love for life extends beyond the fulfilling pleasures of the boudoir. But as the years pass, work, prestige, money blinded him from being a good husband, father, brother, friend,. Firstly, there's an "" everything is beautiful "" sheen to the world he depicts, manifested in the mock - idyll of the semi-aristocratic environment of its protagonists, the deep bond that connects the family business and the workers they employ, and the actors playing the characters themselves, especially the illuminating Lisa Werlinder. The performances are unshowy and honest - not so easy when one of the protaganists is a celebrated actress."
5201,"Always something of a laughing stock (despite a few good contributions, like a good performance in "" Ali "" and directing "" New Jack City ""), Mario Van Peebles has made himself instantly much cooler by making this fun and suitably chaotic film, which chronicles the making of his father Melvin's landmark film "" Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song "". brilliantly illustrates Melvin's struggles, including pretending he was shooting a black porno film to hide his real intent from the crafts unions, running out of money, losing his vision in one eye and finding a distributor for "" Sweet Sweetback . "" While big studios backed away from this project, Melvin jumped forward made Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song. The paradox about this film about the making of a film is that while Mario's movie is technically and cinematic ally superior to Melvin's seminal film, "" Baadasssss! "" Director and co-writer Mario Van Peebles affectionately, but truthfully, chronicles a fictional telling of his father, Melvin Van Peebles' attempt to make "" Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song, "" modern black cinema's groundbreaking film, which was compulsory viewing for the Black Panthers and paved the way for countless black actors, filmmakers and film technicians."
5203,"These positive human traits are contrasted with those of the stubborn uncaring adolescent boy who would rather hang off in the wood, and venture in only to steal what he wants. Wolf is probably closer to Lord of the Flies, but absent all elements of surprise and drama."
5205,"Even in scenes where you do not think there could be a funny moment Kitano is able to deliver one just to break the tension a little. Time and time again Takeshi Kitano proves himself an honorable, direct, and honest filmmaker. If you thought that Japanese cinema is all Akira Kurosawa or the "" Ringu "" series, then you may want to check out an audience favourite at Venice and Toronto Film festivals, "" Zatoichi "". Great swordfights and lots of fun in an epic about a blind hero â€“ could this be all "" Zatoichi "" is about? The fights in this film make the likes of Kill Bill look even more ridiculous than it does already."
5247,"The pace and rhythm of the movie and great cinematography accentuates the underlying and half hidden aspects of the script, Clive Owen's acting really proves here that less is more. These films both combine great style, magnetic performances from the currently best British actors, compelling story lines and sense of warmth emanating from perfectly cast protagonists; Owen and Winstone, respectively. Mike Hodges, whose Get Carter is something of a gold standard for this kind of thing, subverts auidence expectations by producing a similar setup (a ganster related death, the vengeful brother returning to the city to find out what happened) and then proceeding to wrongfoot them by concentrating on the psychological fallout from crime rather than screen violence or genre cliches. For what reasons and under what circumstances it is unclear, Boad has envied Davy's good times and general panache."
5255,"The movie creatures are quite nice, particularly the talkative worms with their tired faces and their walking and flying devices. But it's the sets which are the most beautiful, with a particular attention to lighting, colouring and texturing: many scenes are shot in a golden light, slightly overexposed with lens flares and other atmospheric effects. The vine forest, the village and the spaceship scenes are exceptionally rendered, and among the most beautiful seen in a CG - rendered movie so far. The world of the gods, by contrast, has a dark, liquid and sticky feel (the gods themselves are liquid, gigeresque creatures) with bright shining reflections, and is truly original. It is a fantastical adventure, and they have really used the 3d medium to create their own unique style."
5262,""" Kopps "" was a really funny comedy. The movie is really funny and the characters are nice and believable, with the exception of Benny (Torkel Peterson), a complete moron who thinks he's Neo, Rambo and John McClane in one person. "" Cops "") is a Swedish comedy, which tells about a small town with no crime. Good Swedish comedy, which makes fun of American hard core action movies! Especially the crimes and descriptions of "" Russian mafia "" shoot outs and such are hilarious and well done."
5263,"This documentary is an important effort, now that Fidel Castro â€“ one of the 10 most influential politicians of the last century â€“ is probably close to the end of his life. The beginning of Commandante â€“ yet another Oliver Stone masterpiece â€“ is similar to the beginning of his epic JFK (1991): lots of archive footage of Castro and Cuba, only this time intercut with masses of frenzied crowds drunk on revolutionary fervour, all shouting' Fidel, Fidel', hailing their great man who is still there in this film, forty years later. Stone undoubtedly believes that his film is balanced, and indeed the lack of a voice - over narration allows viewers to listen to the two men talking and draw their own conclusions."
5335,"Of course Ms. Adjani and Virginie Ledoyen play excellent roles - there's just something about those French ladies. It's wartime drama - WWII, with French and Jews and Germans, but this one is somehow fun, earnestly so. The backbone of the story does revolve around a pair of young enthusiasts: GrÃ©gori DerangÃ¨re as FrÃ©dÃ©ric and Virginie Ledoyen (from Francois Ozon's "" 8 Women "") as Camille. The peg for this plot is Frederic, played by brilliant newcomer Gregory Derangere, who is fully up to playing opposite Adjani, Depardieu and Ledoyen. Afterall, those were very good movies, some of them."
5345,"It's funny how something entirely new is produced when the properties of film noir and futuristic sci - fi are married. Like' Until the End of the World,' ' Strange Days,' and' Gattaca,' three films which' Code 46' potently recalls, this is above all else a mood piece, wherein character and plot are secondary to the drifty, elegiac flow of the film. Like the best futuristic films, it's set on the same planet Earth, but the planet's simply been restructured; the old occupants have left and the new ones have moved in. Cold, impersonal environments like these simultaneously forbid and necessitate human warmth. They aren't there for you to watch, they simply set up the extraordinary confines of the romance."
5360,"Solid if understated special effects and and some excellent dramatic moments with a few surprises along the way make Warriors of Heaven and Earth a beautiful experience to behold. Chemistry between actors, excellent music, directing and cinematography, and a good story combine with some decent action sequences to make this tale of warriors a memorable one. Everything that makes for a great Action Adventure film can be found in Warriors of Heaven and Earth. Though this is a "" heroic epic "" telling of the Golden Age of China, director Ping He does an outstanding job of blending depth of character with period - and action - realism within only 115 minutes. Warriors of Heaven and Earth is a decently made movie with some good plot developments."
5408,"And yet this principal becomes mere theory for those whose lives are defined utterly by someone else's effort, often long before they were born. The bright spot of "" Born Rich "" is Ivanka Trump, who is witty and articulate, and balks at the notion that the rich have no problems. The kids in this film are all interesting enough to listen to - they're talking about their "" fabulous "" lives after all. He makes a great case that there is nothing wrong with extraordinary wealth, but everything wrong with inherited wealth. "") Weil's and von Zeitschel's contributions to the film are embarrassing to watch, and epitomize everything that is wrong with inherited wealth."
5412,"Director / star Caouette apparently had about 15 minutes - worth of interesting home - video footage of himself as a child growing up with his once - institutionalized mother and oddball grandparents. He simply dinks around with footage of himself and types his "" life story "" as subtitles over the screen most of the time. His grandparents--who raised Couette when his mother was unable to care for him--are the villains who forced both Renee (Couette's mother) and Couette into psychiatric treatment (although Couette had been exhibiting suicidal behavior, but this is apparently not the point). The fact that someone is showing what its like using their own life in complete truth is amazing. Tarnation is also a movie which leads hope and happiness to come."
5424,"From start to finish this is a fairytale, an intangible voyage through events and interactions with one overshadowing theme: It's all about love. The plot is both incredibly simple and incredibly complex: John (Joaquin Phoenix) goes to New York to get a divorce from his famous figure skating wife, Elena (Claire Danes). Some movies are well done, come are excellently directed, but there's another kind of movies, the beautiful movies. The air of the film is amplified immensely by the beautiful images and the hauntingly sweet music by Zbiegniew Preisner (who has composed the music for many of Kieslowskis films)."
5436,"The direction, performances, cinematography, locations, pace, message etc., everything works perfectly in this great movie. Beautiful Photography, many of the scenes would be great standalone still photos. Tibber's expressive eyes and the breathtaking countryside scenery carry the film until Joan Plowright explodes on the screen. It is amazing how this young actor is able to transmit these sensations and emotions through his face and eyes. The expressive Ben Tibber has a stunning performance in the role of the boy David, who was raised confined in a concentration camp and surrounded by cruelties, that begins to smile and trust people along his travel through Europe."
5450,"This bittersweet comedy about love is in line with great recent French movies such as Amelie or L'Auberge Espagnole, But Jeux d'Enfants is not trying to copy any of the previous. Directed in a superb way by the inventive Yann Samuell, this film can make you laugh out loud in a minute and shed some tears on the next due to the extreme complexity of the feelings the director and the actors share with you. The chemistry between Guillaume Canet and Marion Cotillard is simply perfect. Whether you like it or not, it's difficult to be indifferent to this movie and this is one of the best compliments a director can receive. Across the heart, there is a nasty but very sensitive 7 year - old boy named Juline; both going to the same elementary school."
5698,"The true life story of Calpernia Addams and her successful yet tragic relationship with the soldier who fell in love with her, Barry Winchell. Frank Pierson directs with a gentle hand and delivers poetry to vehicle that could have been awkward in anothers hands. Ron Nyswaner's script is sharp and deep so Pierson is well backed. Troy Garity delivers a surprisingly subtle portrayal of the soldier Barry Winchell. She is smart, beautiful and underneath the dancers facade a true woman who yearns for someone to care for."
5697,"So with all due respect, the puritans who prefer the shallow, campy 70's series with its recycled fx footage, its 2 - dimensional characters and it's plot that provides little context or background, can stick their complaints in their old pipes and smoke 'em. Hand - held photography - pioneered in groundbreaking series like ER and Firefly - has started to become clichÃ©. This is an unusual quality for SciFi originals, and shows that the network invested in quality directing talent and worked with reasonable production deadlines (as opposed to rush - jobs). The characters in this series, faithful to the style of modern scifi series like FireFly, are as realistic, as flawed and ultimately as believable as it gets, warts and all. The best scifi show since Farscape."
5699,"And of course Peter O'Toole steals the film with barely five minutes of total screen time, but that's the kind of talent he was gifted with. Watch it if you enjoy witty dialogue, period pieces and don't you dare miss it if you're a Stephen Fry fan. Otherwise, there are some bright young moments here. Stephen Fry has wowed his fans with his impressive resume of outstanding performances over the years. Impressive cast as well with Peter O'Toole (very funny), Dan Aykroyd, Stockard Channing (hilariously named Mrs. Melrose Ape), Harriet Walter, Imelda Staunton, Simon Callow, Jim Broadbent, Julia McKemzie, John Mills, Jim Carter, Angela Thorne, Bill Paterson, Richard E. Grant, and Margaret Tyzack recognizable."
5700,"This is a truly radical film made by a very courageous filmmaker, someone willing to tell a story, tell it honestly and suffer the consequences of his convictions. A lot of people will approach it with precise expectations, and most of them will be bored or even repelled by its disregard for convention. Gallo plays Bud with brilliantly articulated physical suggestions."
5701,"The dialog is sharp and real, and Marcks has a real skill with his young cast. There are some really excellent performances, especially by Rachael Leigh Cook, who as the trashy Cherie is just the right combination of evil and desperate. Hanks is also good, as is Shawn Hatosy. Good performances from Patrick Swayze and Hilary Swank make this a good cinematic treat. There's enough material for three horror movies--or, with wittier dialogue and more sparkling production values, a substantial sequence in a Quentin Tarantino movie."
5704,"While a lot of it might be there just for provocation, there are moments where the semi-philosophical parts actually hit home quite well. The opening scene with Shuya speaking is removed and in its place is shots of a helicopter circling the city with a soldier speaking in English about Shuya and Mimura. In 2000, Kinji Fukasaku released a controversial but amazing film called Battle Royale, based on a novel, in which 42 ninth graders are placed on a remote island and forced to kill each other until one remained. Being from the UK it is all to refreshing to see a movie in which America is finally made to answer for it's injustices to the majority of the world, and a message which communicates that not all terrorists are evil and that many are just fighting for a cause the only way they know how. Americans tend to hold the belief that all terrorists are evil, while BR2 holds the belief that all terrorists are freedom fighters, if you look somewhere in the middle then you'll find the truth in the way the world works."
5706,"He wrote of his experiences in flop houses, bars, and women in a very distinctive, one - of - a-kind, formless fashion. This is an extraordinary documentary, capturing Bukowski in the 1970's and 1980's mostly, telling the story of his incredible life and alternatively capturing private moments that define him as well as defy his reputation. The film uses interviews of those that lived with him and knew him to portray a man that waded through an interpersonal sewer of a life, only to conquer the literary world on his own terms and make a decent living from it to boot. This documentary gives insight into Bukowski's life, showing both his artistry and his personal problems. Filmed over 10 to 15 years, it is not hero worship in any sense, it's as raw and revealing of a tortured, yet extremely funny individual as one can capture on film."
5716,"When it comes to screenplay Park Chan - Wook is unique (at least for western standards) in his way of filming. SPOILERS Leave aside for a moment the obvious plot holes, large and small--although it's worth noting that there's a whole lot of them. Leave aside the contrivances, too: the endless special gadgets the bad guy comes up with just when he needs them, the rather magical view of hypnosis, Dae - Su's magical new abilities, the seeming omnipotence of the badguy. But leaving aside the notion that Dae - Su's tormentor's omnipresence seems to weigh against the notion of him and Mi - do doing anything, really, but take their lumps or try to fight back, the fact that Dae - Su is considered by the movie to have really "" done "" something makes any critique pretty complicated. Remember, in COUNT Dantes is a true innocent."
5708,"Two polar opposite characters - a quiet and meticulous Japanese librarian with a shady past and designs on ending his life (Asano Tadanobu) and a feisty, straight - talking thai female escort (Sinitta Boonyasak) - have one thing in common and not much else it seems. Assured, amusing and touching, this multi-lingual film is replete with a dry wit, a surreal element that leaves a lot to interpretation and a deft ability to prick the emotions. There are laudable performances from the two central characters, and a third from Christopher Doyle's shifting oblique camera - work and composition. Tadanobu Asano, best known as the masochistic villain Kakihara of Takashi Miike's Ichi the Killer, plays a withdrawn Japanese man living for unspecified reasons in Thailand. Through a couple of events, which are too good to spoil, he meets with polar opposite Sinitta Boonyasak, a Thai girl who works dressed up as a Japanese schoolgirl, and is probably something of a prostitute."
5709,"The scene in the trenches where Hitler is mocked by his fellow soldiers and decides to take it out on his dog is simply a disgrace and an insult to the intelligence of all viewers. Think of it this way: The most successful murderers and big criminals are usually the smart, well - spoken and socially established men. The best bits in this are the convincing recreations of the look of the Reichstag and other places associated with the rise of Hitler. First of all, the performances set by Carlyle and companions are quite good."
5719,"So it is remarkable and truly rewarding to see how Miike toned down his tastes for the twisted and perverted in One Missed Call. Furthermore he implemented his flair of storytelling through symbolisms and graphic metaphors quite nicely. In conclusion, One Missed Call satisfies on many levels, providing you keep an open mind and just enjoy the ride. Another plus of the movie is the appearances of several gorgeous J - idols, such as Kazue Fukishii and Kou Shibasaki. A high school student named Yumi Kamura finds with a group friends in a coffee bar, while her pal Yoko receives a cellular call with a rare tone which she had heard before."
5722,"What could only be titled as Cinema of the Ridiculous, Maddin's latest masterpiece, about a no - legged beer queen who hosts a Winnipeg - set competition to see which nation has the saddest music in the world, is filled to the gills with wacky ideas, but the reason it's a great film is because of the heartfelt feeling behind it. Maddin's genuine love for the silent cinema that he emulates (and attachment to the pathetic characters he creates) makes it possible for him to sustain a comic tone without it ever becoming mocking. It's an exciting movie visually, but unlike the best of the silents that Maddin loves, it's not poetic in that slow, beautiful way--it's too fast - paced, kinetic, and rough to achieve any sort of traditional beauty--but it is a feast. Maddin is truly one of the most imaginative of directors and he has a firm grasp of the medium. In fact, there is at least one scene of slow, beautiful poetry--a purely silent moment, near the end, that comes alongside the bloody murder of Rossellini's screams."
5725,"Basically if you like Daft Punk, Anime or Simply want to try something a bit different Interstella is worth checking out. However, the first four segments were Daft Punk's commercially released music videos for the Discovery the quality is exceptional, but after that the film seems to jump into a lower standard with thicker outlines and repeating of footage from the first four segments, that's not to say it doesn't look good. The animation by Leiji Matsumoto is just so beautiful; for instance, the "" nightvision "" you get of the town on Earth (probably inspired by Tokyo) is breathtaking. A "" digital love story "" of a kidnapped technoband - who incidentally travel together in a Scooby - Do like' Mystery Machine' as events unfold - and an evil music impresario (echoes of the obscure Toomorrow here (1970) - anyone seen that?) What makes the film so great is the peculiar manga - music hybrid that results, as the stylised visual design and editing rhythms join with a contemporary soundtrack (the entire film is wordless outside of lyrics) in a way which is both culturally nostalgic as well as being strikingly modern in effect."
5726,"If you have any interest whatsoever is the GENRE of martial arts movies (where the quality of the story is usually not the primary concern), watch this movie. When head of Ong Bak is stolen, Ting (Tony Ja) swear to bring it back from the thugs. If you are of sound mind, this film will leave you gob - smacked at the way that Muay Thai has been portrayed on film - promoting its effectiveness in streetfighting situations and the acrobatics performed by this guy are just incredible. This movie is filled with incredible fight scenes, from the multitude of fights in the fighting circle, to that final fight in the cave. No wires, just a show of talent and that is what Tony Jaa brings."
5727,"Thought the first one was one of the finest Cop thrillers in recent years and the follow up is equally brilliant - for obvious reasons its a prequel set in 3 time periods leading up to the events in the first movie. To complicate matters Yan is Hau's half brother who as a cop is willing to infiltrate Hau's gang but whose loyalty is put under pressure when he realises that Wong (who he is working for) had a hand in his Fathers murder. There is a fantastic scene where Hau contrives to have himself held in Police custody whilst the other gang bosses are murdered and the way the film cuts between his interview (where he reveals how he knows who killed his Father) and the other bosses being wiped out is worthy of comparison with Coppola's Godfather - the series has that whole epic feel and the way it culminates with the handover of power to the Chinese in 1997 with new bosses on both sides of the conflict coming to power is very well done. The first movie in this series was a complex thriller that was presented as the end game in a long battle between the Hong Kong police and criminal gangs; but the back story was only hinted at. Although the first movie was compared by some to Michael Mann's' Heat', in fact it is this film that better bears the comparison as a tale of adversaries on opposite sides of the law, and it stands up to that comparison well: the subtle behaviours of the heroes and villains alike more interesting than the macho posturings of the gangsters and cops depicted in American movies."
5729,"The experience of trucking a load of monstrously talented - notoriously hard partying rock n'rollers across Canada in a train with a well stocked bar, guitar amps, and a drum kit while the cameras rolled is singularly unique in the annals of rock n'roll - so is this film! If you are a fan of the 60's and you enjoy Janis Joplin and the Grateful Dead, you must see this film. JANIS just steals the show every time she appears in the film, but there are many other people with memorable lines and comments, so in the whole it's an amazing feast for the eyes and ears! In the wake of Woodstock, it was time for the players to have their fun. The Dead, Janis, The Band all had very good performances."
5732,"There are no answers to these questions, only open sea and the mounting dangers just below the surface. The triumph of Open Water is that writer / director Chris Kentis constructed a disarmingly simple film that ends up being incredibly effective in its goals--to present an intense, thrilling, suspenseful life or death scenario with horrific implications and subtextual commentary on appreciating and living life to its fullest, even when faced with the power and non-judgmental potential brutality of nature. Shot entirely on digital video, Kentis achieves a look that is crisply, almost otherworldly beautiful and colorful and which at the same time conveys a stark, voyeuristic glimpse at a "" home movie "". This atmosphere helps create an extremely realistic feel, aided by the outstanding performances of Ryan and Travis as well as Kentis' naturalistic direction. Kentis also deserves kudos for the resolution of the film, which is wonderfully poetic and nihilistic at the same time."
5735,"Astonishingly enough, this is the feature film debut for director Andrei Zvyagintsev who demonstrates more of a mastery and command of the medium in this his maiden effort than most directors do in a whole body of work. Zvyagintsev beautifully captures the opposite ways in which the boys react to and interact with their father. Through this intense interaction, the film emerges as a complex and profound study of what father and son relationships are really all about. As portrayed by Vladimir Garin, Andrey looks up to his father with a mixture of boyish pride and trembling awe, longing for the kind of male affirmation he has been deprived of all these years. Konstantin Lavronenko is equally impressive as the boy's mysterious father, beautifully underplaying the part of a man who can appear sane and rational on the surface but who is a seething cauldron of untapped emotions beneath."
5739,"The film allows the CEOs to get a fair chance to present their opinions and it never demonises any of them, the vast majority of them actually come off as very nice guys who seem to genuinely want to be ethical, environmental etc. . (p. 56) He adds that the corporation's sole reason for being is to enhance the profits and power of the corporation. Directors Mark Achbar and Jennifer Abbott bring these points and a slew of others to cinematic life through interviews, archival footage, and a fine narrative written by Achbar and Harold Crooks. An interesting technique that Achbar and Abbott use is to go down the list of behaviors cited in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders that identify the psychopathic personality and show how the corporation has all of those behaviors including a criminal disregard for the welfare and feelings of others and a complete absence of guilt. Bakan, Achbar and Abbott play fair, and give both sides of the case--although that is not to say that the weight of evidence or sentiment is equally distributed."
5740,"The Yes Men is a documentary about a group of anti-economic liberalization activists who have made a unique habit of impersonating the WTO and other right - wing organizations (including the George W. Bush presidential campaign) in talks and national media spots. To see them advocating the employment of sweatshop workers because it's more humane than slavery and MUCH more cost effective (since "" involuntarily relocated workers "" require room and board at American rates and in the third world you can employ dozens for the same price and you don't have to look after their health or recoup the costs of transporting them overseas if they "" escape ""), while nobody listening bats an eye, is hilarious (if horrifying). The purpose of the group, The Yes Men, is to point out the lack of humanitarianism exhibited by those interested in world politics. The Yes Men is a brilliant and hilarious documentary by the filmmakers of American Movie. The film centres around a small group of anti-globalization activists who went around the world posing as WTO representatives at major industry conferences."
5748,"And of course the genuine kindness of strangers. If you liked STRANGER THAN PARADISE (1984) or BAGDAD CAFE (1988) or enjoy the stunning color photos of Joel Meyerowitz, you have the qualifications necessary to enjoy SCHULTZE GETS THE BLUES. Come to think of it, anybody who's watched NAPOLEON DYNAMITE (2004) more than once might well enjoy SCHULTZE's journey, too. First things first: You will need a lot of patience while watching "" Schultze gets the blues "". Schultze is a quiet man, recently retired, who suddenly discovers the beauty of zydeco music."
5758,"Gozu is a fabulous act of surrealistic tastelessness, a peering into filmmaker and screenwriter into what can f *** around enough in their psyches to have it blasted back into these characters here. even so, Gozu was really a peak experience. Acting: A - Hideki Sone, who plays Minami, is absolutely fantastic in this movie, as is Sho Aikawa, who has a supporting role in Ozaki. GOZU shows him on fine creative form once more, turning a story that probably isn't all that interesting into a surreal, dreamlike experience. e seen more than half a dozen Miike flicks and GOZU is definitely he's most deviantly outrageous so far."
5781,"He is captured and sentenced to thirty - two years in prison; however, he succeeds to escape with the criminals Lee McCall (Dexter Fletcher) and Allan Heyl (David Patrick O'Hara) and together they form "" The Stander Gang "" and rob another twenty banks in six months. For people born after the 70's and far away from South Africa this era is something almost make believe but this movie brings it to glorious and heart breaking true life. Hopefully it will have some interesting extras This film has plenty of great action scenes and alot of great comedy as well as brilliant acting by the whole cast, especially Thomas Jane who shines as Stander. Very fascinating, and fun to watch, as well as thought provoking, once again the Q&A would answer all of the problems other posters had with the film, because the stuff they did not like was the actual facts behind the characters lives, just AMAZING!"
5796,"The story (about real - life killings of 10 women in Korea during the 1986 - 1991) is compelling enough, but the actors (Song Kang - ho cuts you deep even when he's silent, and his big - city partner offers emotional jolts at the end), the director (effectively plays some scenes in docu - style approach), the cinematography (a shadow creeps out in the paddy field will give you, well, creeps. , and the music (haunting) are welcome bonuses. The tempo, the thrill, the development of characters, everything it has been well worked. Kang - ho Song and Sang - kyung Kim are brilliant as the two cops who have drastically different views on how to solve a crime. A perfectly made detective film based on a real shocking murder case in S. Korea in 80's."
5820,"Funny bits involve running clips from Kurt Loder, E! TV as well as a subplot about an obsessed fan, it's all woven together pretty well. The guy openly makes fun of himself and his movies. If your heart is in comedy and you remember the great movies of BioDome, Encino Man, Son In Law, then you'll love this flick. He fakes his death and everyone starts saying they miss him and his wit and humor. The plan amazingly works, but then Pauly's ruse is revealed and he's thrown into jail amidst a torrent of public scorn to learn wisdom at the feet of Todd Bridges, the normal sized kid from Different Strokes."
5826,"Both these movies successfully try to portray awful times of World War II through a human destiny. Zelary tells a powerful story and the film has been wonderfully made - the photography in particular is outstanding, capturing the beauty and harshness of the mountain village location. The romance between Eliska and Joza proceeds in a believable, if inevitable, way, making an improbable pairing seem perfectly natural. The story revolves around her adaptation to life in this beautiful mountain village where people live much as they did 150 years ago, and her growing attachment and commitment to Joza and the people around her. In Zelary, a Czech film by Ondrej Trojan, an abiding romance between a rugged sawmill worker and a sophisticated medical student emerges from the conflict in Czechoslovakia during World War II."
5863,"Harvie Krumpet is one excellent story. There is also excellent Claymation that adds many dimensions to the characters. The characters, and such a film is absolutely all about characters are great in how the specificities of clay are used to convey absolutely every emotional nuance. This little Australian claymation production was an unlikely winner for best animated short at the Oscar ceremony for 2003, beating a pixar production and other anime - bigwigs. It's not been so long, but this still works on all its purposes, humor and visuals."
5864,"Sometimes people complain about their raucous, noisy behavior, but usually onlookers are charmed by the colorful, intelligent birds. Mark Bittner, a jobless but not irresponsible man living for several years on the Hill became curious about the parrots--mostly cherry - topped conures--and eventually befriended them, spending much of his time feeding the chipper, clever birds. He talks about particular birds, describing their distinctive traits, and the director uses footage that depicts these traits, winning and otherwise. This documentary is made with lots of lovingness and doses of TLC (tender loving care). Judy Irving and Mark Bittner have done a wonderful job capturing his calmness and humanity against the backdrop of wild parrots."
5869,"This is not an Oscar movie or one with long lasting deep plots but it is a decent way to laugh on a rainy day. You will not split your sides laughing but the pace is good and the jokes funny rather than silly most of the time. So if you just want some good laughs and don't care about crappy endings, this movie is for you. After their first couple of ideas turn out very badly, they find themselves in the company of two older ladies who appear to be very wealthy. The true heart of the movie comes when the two sisters played by Louise Lasser and Renee Taylor, team up with their much younger husbands played by Will Friedle and Chris Owen."
5895,"He silently amuses in the role, with the quiet nature of someone who is truly at peace with all things around him. Jim True - Frost's Gibbs is a subtle, complex study of a man figuring out where his peace lies and J. K. Simmons' simply centered George anchors the other characters. He has several excellent scenes where he blurts out all these intense feelings. Gibbs, who came from the IRS to audit the family, stays 8 years, long enough to paint New Mexican landscapes of note."
5901,"Annabella Piugattuk is wonderful as the succinct Inuit girl. If you love movies that are true to the culture they are portraying, this definitely is for you. The movie is exceptionally well made, especially considering its low 10 million CDN budget. Having spent several years in air search an rescue, this movie is most excellent on how people react when things go wrong. Despite language barriers, the two characters manage to communicate well enough, and their relationship blossoms in a fascinating way."
5338,"This is a film without violence about people living ordinary extra-ordinary lives and it's much more interesting than extra-ordinary murders, which very, very few, even in the USA, encounter. It is this moment that defines, with one pure act, the epitome of what it feels to be in your late teens, early 20's looking out at life. It his in her that the movie comes out the realm of quirky off - kilter comedy and gains heart, soul, and intimacy all to rare to achieve in films these days. From there the plot grows as he connects with old friends and makes new ones and discovers the joys of life and love mostly thanks to the arrival of free - spirited Sam (Natalie Portman). Even those touching moments were funny; the fact that he couldn't swim!"
4970,"In short, this could have been a great movie about the moral problems posed by human cloning. Godsend has some admirable script characteristics, a good to great cast and some very good technical aspects. Although Godsend also mixes some strong fantasy elements into its "" twist "" and the consequences that lead to the film being a thriller / horror picture, the basic idea is one rooted in actual genetics."
4969,"The extravagant lifestyle that Black gains and the fact that he still tries to be best friends with Stiller causes Stiller to become crazy with envy. This movie is destined to lose a lot of money at the box office and become a DVD cult classic. He is always quite a character in his movies. Not for everyone but if you like Stiler, Black or Walken, see the movie and judge for yourself."
5343,"Foxx was entertaining, too, as the nerd - ish cab driver who is pulled into Cruise's murdering adventures. After twelve years on the job he has become quite gifted at discerning the most intimate details of his passengers' lives. His worldly insight manages to tear down the defenses of one of his passengers, a State Attorney played by Jada Pinkett Smith, who graces him with her phone number. Poetic scenes involving an understated fight for motherly affection and a question of morality of the hows and whens to kill lead to an intense relationship that seems to bond the two men. Just as Sophia Coppola made Tokyo seem like a glittering rest home in' Lost in Translation,' Mann transforms the noirish L. A. into a neon nirvana with aerial shots that soften the ragged, undistinguished architecture."
5344,"Not everything in life is so happy and movies shouldn't always play out to the happy ending fairy tale. Though this is a comedy, she plays the character as the (semi) straight - man role and it makes the film, because it lets the other characters around her (like Holly Hunter, Kevin Sussman and Stephen Tobolowsky in particular) shine in some of the funnier parts. But if you enjoy "" To Die For, "" "" American Psycho, "" and other dark satirical comedies, and you're up for a little snarky humor and some great media parody, you will probably enjoy this movie. , this movie has heart and a wicked sense of humor when it comes to exposing talk shows for their secrets, lies, and pure entertainment souls. Joseph Tobolowsky, Kevin Sussman are among the supporting players that contribute to make this film fun to watch."
4858,"Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston are both intelligent and (especially Aniston) fairly versatile actors. Upon returning home Reuben and his best friend Sandy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) go to a party and run into Polly Prince (Jennifer Aniston) whom they went to school with years earlier. A few times during the film characters would inexplicably have these emotional speeches that are supposed to summarize everything but all they achieve is overstating the obvious. Stiller gives another of his patented hapless schmuck romantics turns as newlywed risk management assessor whose marriage is on the rocks when his wife (Messing) has an affair on their honeymoon, sending him back to NYC to assess his life and runs into former junior high friend Aniston who knocks him for a loop despite her flaky demeanor. Frequently funny and evenly paced by writer and first - time director John Hamburg the laughs come often and no thanks to Hoffman as Stiller's sloven has - been actor buddy and Baldwin as his vulgar boss."
5346,"If two chicks sitting in stalls playing' Battleshits' while the two Indian and Asian' heroes' hide between them suffering the sounds and smells of scatological low humor sounds funny to you, then you should consider seeing' Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle . ' Castle' has such fun imitating the roguish good will of the Hope / Crosby road pictures while commenting on the egregious weaknesses of parents and police that almost anyone who doesn't mind a breast or two bared in the name of satire can laugh heartily at modern adult pretensions and youthful indiscretion. Yes there is plenty of Drug Humor and sex humor, but the funniest stuff is actually the on going humor involved with racial inequality and characters who learn how to break those typifications because of their symbolic journey to White Castle. It does dabble with some stereotypes but the times the stereotpyes are broken especially from Kumar who brings a light fun and jovial spirit to the film and has some of the funniest moments. The scenes where Harold is giving career advice at a college Asian club meeting or where Kumar is talking with his father and older brother who are both doctors at the hospital are funny, and have an air of authenticity."
5347,"Memorable scenes include the ball, the parade, the wooden leg, and the continuing romance between Joe and Queen Clarice. Anyone who liked the first Princess Diaries movie will like this. Julie Andrews gave a great performance as the former Queen of Genovia. There are plenty of other "" profound "" movies out there to inspire, teach, or depress you! The screenplay is full of grotesque amateurish caricatures that irritate from early in the film."
5348,"And the film's director, Paul W. S. Anderson, has always excelled at set design. In' Event Horizon' he perfectly captured the dark essence of the' Alien' series; with' Resident Evil' he managed to mimic the Gothic structure of all great zombie movies. ' Alien vs. Predator' â€“ - a project that took 14 astonishing years to bring to the big screen (longer than' Freddy vs. Jason') â€“ - doesn't do much to change this. Yes, his set design here is fantastic (it's no surprise that a great amount of pre-production work went into creating these enormous surroundings). Fox has taken two of their greatest franchises and turned them into a joke."
5349,"The movie was perfect, for what it is meant to be--90 minutes of excitement for adolescent boys. It was like watching theoretical Dungeons and Dragons geeks if they were to spar on ESPN, only the latter would probably be more entertaining because of the commercials."
5350,""" Bob & Carol and Ted & Alice "" decades ago parodied the sexual revolution that included, for some, mate swapping and adultery as - almost - a rite of passage for young, well - educated, affluent couples. The end here is as reassuring as viewers want (or need) it to be. The score, ranging from Beethoven's Symphony No. 1 to bagpipe music to an almost minimalist accompaniment to critical scenes, is well integrated with Larry Cross's crisp screenplay. It shows a potent portrait of two couples whose marriages are going to break; has an enormous power and tells some uncomfortable truths. The four grown - ups (as well as their children who are perfectly aware of the situation) are very talented and all deliver passionate and compulsive performances."
5351,"The inclusion of Burt Reynolds' crazy mountain man is a comedic plus, but the nature loving hippy - girls and uncouth drug traffickers which pop up periodically aren't as funny as they should be. But, luckily it has some genuinely funny moments too to bring the movie through to its end. The comedic material is mostly original stuff, but there's nothing outstanding to be seen, apart from a few memorable moments. What sounds like your average, everyday sort of male bonding roadtrip film is essentially. The three leads are what make the film decently funny: Seth Green is excellent as he begrudgingly reveals his various phobias from everything from the dark to ceran wrap."
5358,"Bring the crackers because mama, this movie is bringin' the cheese! From the lush jungle scenery to the splendid visuals of the snakes right under the surface of the water, Anacondas is at least a movie that's always nice to look at. In the hopes of becoming millionaires, a group of young, "" attractive "" researchers hire a boat, whose captain is expectedly hard - boiled and hunky, to take them into the jungles of Borneo in search of the rare Blood Orchid, a flower with the ability to prolong life but the catch is that it blooms for only a six month period every seven years, and they're approaching the last few weeks of that time span. The objective is to find a flower, Blood Orchid, that flourishes for a couple of weeks every seven years and could be a fountain of youth, prolonging the expectation of life of human beings. He directed the underrated Halloween 4 and his older films are far superior to Anacondas."
5359,"Merhige tries his best to get inside the atmosphere that this killer and it's tracker (s) are in, and he succeeds by almost trying too hard. Even though the story was involving and for the most part entertaining, the screenplay had a lot of holes in it, and there were a lot of scenes that were never made 100% clear. That is one of the many questions Mackelway (and the audience) have to answer. E. Elias Merhige's direction is good, but nothing memorable (although Kingsley's remote viewing sessions are pretty intriguing). Director Merhige does an excellent job with atmosphere (who knew it rained so much in the desert of New Mexico?)"
8586,"It's a smart and sassy homage to fifties films that expertly balances farce with message. Letscher has the part down perfectly; he's an adorable cad who could be inserted into any romantic comedy of that era and fit right in. Stylistically the film captures the spirit of the era, from the titles, to music, and the creative use of computer imagery and set design. In 1950s Hollywood actor Guy Stone (Matt Letscher) is very popular--and secretly gay. It was a fun, witty, and fresh look at 50s Hollywood."
5361,"Director Mira Nair has said what made Witherspoon the ideal Becky Sharp was the actress' "" American energy and sassiness . "" The highlights are Declan Quinn's striking cinematography, performances by Hoskins and Atkins, the only two who seem to be having any fun, and a superbly restrained Ifans, playing convincingly against type. Elegant costumes, beautiful scenery, and piano playing in excess all add to the sights and sounds of Mira Nair's film' Vanity Fair . ' She leaves for Pitt with her friend Amelia (Romola Garai), who is engaged to an officer George Osborne (Jonathan Rhys - Meyers). Ifans' is a fantastic, heartbreaking performance, the best of the movie."
5362,"The press will clearly do anything to get the perfect shot. The ringleader of the gang, Rex Harper (Tom Sizemore) soon realizes that he and his gang are the ones in danger. Looked like a pretty interesting take on the action / thriller genres. The lead roles Cole Hauser and Tom Sizemore are quite impressive. The story is good and entertaining but could go a little deeper, some twists here and there would have spiced it up a little."
5363,"There are a few twists and turns that will keep your attention. The film begins a bit slowly but picks up very nicely about 30 minutes into it. Matthew Lillard is effective as the wise - acre best - friend, showing subtleties the role of Shaggy would not permit. The director uses split - screen techniques that enhance the look and feel of the film, lifting it from the realm of the ordinary to the plane of art. and the end of the movie is perfect, when they see each other for the first time in two years, after a desperate four day search."
5373,"However, controversy engulfs the film's systematic and clearly spontaneous manners of violence and drug abuse, claiming it to depict scenes extremely relative to that of the death of Baby P. Ignore that though. Baby Geniuses II is really a Great Movie. Overall this film is for everyone, the jokes are hilarious, the action scenes are nail - biting and the polish of this family adventure is perfectly executed. The Super Babies Are Really So Convincing, so cute and acted like professionals despite the fact they are amateur babies. Plot Of The Movie From Wikipedia: The baby geniuses become involved in a scheme by media mogul Bill Biscane (Jon Voight), later revealed to be known as Kane, who kidnaps children everywhere."
5374,"The parts that weren't so believable were very satisfying and the parts that were believable were incredibly suspenseful. It's not a To Kill a Mockingbird of Of Mice and Men, but it is a wonderful escape from all you problems for a couple hours and you'll feel like you've been on the most exhilarating thrill ride you could find in the park! All thumbs up for this one! Case in point: "" Cellular "" is the proud owner of one of the most ineptly scored chase sequences ever, as if Ellis simply heard a snippet of the song's lyrics ("". And yet, for all of its failures as art, "" Cellular "" is always entertaining for those very same faults."
5375,"While Jovovich rides in to save the day on a motorcycle and carries so many guns it's a wonder she doesn't fall over, Sienna Guillory (as tough bitch cop Jill Valentine) has the dubious honour of performing various athletic action sequences in a miniskirt and boob tube. Like the timelessly cheesy horror / action flicks of John Carpenter, the Resident Evil franchise throws realism and political correctness to the wind and just has fun pitting Pretty Girls With Big Guns against Ugly Monsters With Big Teeth. the cut scenes in the video game are better directed. Hollywood is known for its summertime action "" flicks "", and recent action films such as The Matrix began to show a hopeful turn towards a trend of thoughtful plots and interesting stories. After a handful of survivors have escaped, Alice is caught and put in a lab, where she not only manages to escape, but also to manifest psychic powers while quipping off several lines that were used to advertise the movie in commercials."
5376,""" Mr. 3000 "" has those moments, those moments where you agree that this should have been made into a multi-million dollar feature with big stars and extras and a caterer and all that. Therefore, the film has this two - headed character, one who is Bernie Mac improvising a nice little scene, and one who is Stan Ross, Mr. 3000 himself. So enjoy, but beware the slow scenes with little meaning. The director and writer are content to tell a straightforward but very entertaining story with a good message for athletes of all ages. "" Mr. 3000 "" is funny and ultimately quite touching, and the ending is both surprising and fitting."
5377,"The overall style is 1930's Art Deco mixed with bits of Neo-Futurism. The robots in the first half hour of the film look like something out of comic book, the clothes and character styles are most certainly inspired by the 1930's, and the backdrops and locations are very Deco. With an assist from Sky Captain's faithful sidekick Dex (Giovanni Ribisi) and the disconcertingly military Frankie (Angelina Jolie), the two search the world--and finally track the wicked Dr. Totenkopf (Laurence Olivier, resurrected via CGI) to his secret lair. If you know nothing about serials, for example, you are likely to be appalled by the flatness of the script and Paltrow's one - note performance; on the other hand, if you are a serial fan, you'll immediately recognize that the script is reflective of such serials as SPY SMASHER and that Paltrow echoes Linda Sterling, famous for such serials as THE CRIMSON GHOST. It gives the great atmosphere of old cinema plus comic books, and it does so perfectly using flying funny looking evil robots, strange laser guns, and comic - book like dialog."
5378,"There are heaps of real - life tennis couples and this movie is a great example of how two people from different places and upbringings can change each other's lives. Whichever it is, Mr. Bettany's charm and ease help soften her one - note approach to her role. His presence adds a nice touch, giving a certain "" real tennis "" feel to the fictitious tennis players in the film. Despite not having real professional tennis players in the acting roles, the action sequences in the matches do look very convincing, thanks to the amazing cinematography. You certainly realise how far cinematic technology has progressed over the years when you see Bettany and Dunst belt out those groundstrokes and smashes almost as beautifully as the real - life, seasoned pros would."
5379,"Part X-Files and part Lifetime movie of the week, "" The Forgotten "" seems to really channel Chris Carter's hit TV show, look it even has a redhead. The solid supporting cast is also interesting, Gary Sinise, Alfre Woodard, Anthony Edwards and the excellent Linus Roache, who alas, doesn't have anything to do in the film, with the exception of appearing out of nowhere, every now and then. Oh, this movie has one of the best "" jump in your seat "" auto scenes ever! The scenes of people flying in and out of the air is really cool in terms of special effects but the reason for it once you find out is kind of a cop out and very far fetch. On these more conspicuous levels, The Forgotten is an excellent, enthralling yarn, as long as viewers have a taste for fantasy."
5380,"So you've got undercover agent Joe (Baldwin) who is so dedicated to his job, that he lets someone cut his finger off, just in order to get a longer sentence. The rest of the characters orbit gently around these two propellers, spawning a genuine web of film - making personnel. The film proves to be a productive comedy - as in you'll get plenty of chances to prove your laughing capabilities - and is also dubbed by a layer of "" sensfullness "", meaning it's a smart comedy. the intro credits are simply brilliant! Meanwhile, the casting is beginning and actually getting the attention of worthwhile movie stars, most notably Emily French (Toni Collette)."
5381,"Some interesting points that John Waters raised during the Q&A session was how he fought the MPAA for an "" R "" rating but lost in a 7 - 4 vote. He also mentioned that the community he filmed "" A DIRTY SHAME "" in was very friendly and that they all posed next to the trees with prosthetic vaginas and sphincters with their families for photos! Johnny Knoxvile as the "" Jesus "" of the sex addicts and his twelve apostles that are trying to free people to their sexual awakening is so over the top its perfect. And all the sex addicts are just awesome and show no shame. The whole town starts to convert, as the neuters (normals) lose the fight for decency."
5382,"The passion he creates as the central protagonist Guevara is utterly astonishing as he deals with asthma problems, love lives and money issues. Using different countries such as Peru, Venezuela, and Spain allows viewers to gain an insight into the vastness of life. Using poor countries as well as rich countries allows viewers to see different sides to the world in the 1950s and was pulled off greatly. The scenery is always beautiful with shots of the towns in a poor state and the general background of the countries is to be admired."
5383,"There are two scenes in the film which seem to summarise this (and also shine a light of Simon Pegg as a very clever and funny writer) and both scenes simply involve Shaun walking to the nearby corner shop. Not that this film is subtle however, there is a stunning array of visual comedy, one liners and (best of all) some digs at other films from the horror genre. The funniest being a very subtle snipe at Boyles ` 28 days later' - see if you can spot it! Shaun of the Dead is a superb blending of horror and comedy ala An American Werewolf in London (1981), Idle Hands (1999), Frankenhooker (1990), or the Evil Dead films (beginning with the 1981 original, although there is progressively less to more comedy in that series). The film begins firmly in very British comedy / drama territory, with a number of stylistic directorial flourishes that seem like a cross between Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream (2000) and Danny Boyle's Trainspotting (1996)."
5393,"The animation is beautiful (though not as good as anything done by Pixar in the last 10 years) and it really gives the deep blue that admirable quality. Zellwegger gives a decent, if shallow, performance as the love interest, and Jolie's Lola is barely on screen long enough for her to make an impact. Some in jokes and references do work - having Ziggy Marley solemnly tell Oscar (Smith) that he's singing reggae wrong is clever. The animation looks good, and a lot of movie references are clever. A couple of the jokes worked, some pop - culture references were funny, the movie was not too boring."
5394,"This is a film that definitely looks at the day to day lives of firemen as it is primarily through the eyes of Jack Morrison. For all the focus played to the rising star Pheonix, it is the supporting cast that really stands out within the confines of the 105 minute running time. Again, these are the real heroes of life and the movie well portrays what real firefighters have to go through. Yet another beautiful Australian actress, Barrett has the largest load in the film as the anchor that questions why her husband and father of her children would risk his lives for others ignoring his own well being. Lead by seasoned veteran Jack Morrison (Pheonix), the firemen are able to rescue a helpless employee before the floor gives way trapping Morrison within the building inferno."
5395,"In an attempt to help Albert seek answers to his profound questions, Bernard and Vivian join Albert with a disillusioned firefighter named Tommy (Mark Whalberg) who seeks answers to the same questions on life. What's more, perceptions have an important role in this film. And their guides along the way, deftly portrayed by Hoffman, Tomlin and Huppert stir the pot of confusion in this boiling mess of angst, deception and discontent. While the performances by Schwartzman, Law and Wahlberg (sounds like a law firm) were wonderful and engaging, the real star of this movie is the writing. At any rate, HUCKABEES is a clear descendant of films like MORGAN!"
5396,"A lot of people don't like Hillary movies but this one is worth seeing. Even if you don't particularly like Hillary, you should still see it because this is one of her best movies. It's different than her other movies and she really shines in this. Yes, she's a better actress than a singer, but both of these aspects of her are far superior to the movie. the performances of Hilary as well as her supporting cast were honorable."
5397,"In fact the film contains and is defined by many aspects deliberately avoided in "" sci - fi movies "", namely, the surface banality inherent in much of engineering or innovation. Listening to these characters talk, you feel relieved that there is none of the nonsense typically associated with sci - fi films: no buxom models or chisel - faced bodybuilders arguing passionately about trivialities while secretly accomplished in physics. Perhaps thats why it feels so fresh."
5398,"Director Richard Eyre (Iris) and screenwriter Jeffrey Hatcher have loosely interpreted true events to deliver a passionate, romantic journey of gender - bending self - realisation set in the bawdy world of the British Restoration, circa 1660. The one most effective element is Rupert Everett's performance as Charles II, his best - an that is saying a lot - in many, many moons. This is unfair - the film is more thought provoking, substantial and better acted than the aforementioned Oscar snaffler. As previously referred to, the acting is exceptional, especially the two leads (Danes and Crudup) who shine. Ned Keynaston (Billy Crudop) is the leader of the pack, a star of the stage whose Desdemona is the height of his career."
5399,"Further, as many voters must have lacked an appreciation of great music and dancing. In trying to "" Americanize "" the great Japanese film of the same name, the film makers had no idea what they were getting into. In fact, the original film, directed with great flair by Masoyuki Suo, loses all its charm with this reincarnation. In the end, this is better then most romantic comedies that have come out in the past year and this film can be enjoyed if your just looking for a good time. It is pleasant to see a nice cast like the sexy Jennifer Lopez, the charming Richard Gere, the surprisingly great dancer Stanley Tucci, the funny Lisa Ann Walter, the wonderful Susan Sarandon and excellent support actors and actresses playing and dancing great music along 106 minutes."
5400,"For those who want to bother comparing it to Parkers earlier forays, yes, it is better than Cannibal! The fact that these are puppets is enough to make you laugh throughout the entire film. Another infamous scene that got a lot of attention, was the sex scene between 2 lead puppets. A very entertaining (adult) cinematic excursion for the South Park creators, and an impressive display of puppetry skills (for which the sex scenes will be remembered! Take note that a grand total of zero big name actors lend their voice to this film, though Little B ** ch (Dian Bachar) does give a little appearance here and there."
5401,"A welcomed little performance piece film full of nice little moments. And Glenne Headly is always a treat, here as an old family friend who finds herself putting out emotional fires. Regardless of what others say, the film is great. Zooey Deschanel delivers an amazing performance. Black humor is a beautiful thing and they did a wonderful job of getting laughs from a macabre situation."
5905,"Was also nice to enjoy some good acting from unknown faces and excellent cinematography - the film had a great look - pale blue / white and red, and good editing. "" Somersault "" is a vivid, interesting coming - of - age tale about a young girl who runs away from home, and quickly has encounters and experiences that force her to grow up fast. It's a masterful scene of restrained horror, in which the camera focuses on Lake Jindabyne, the night sky, and Abbie Cornish's chiaroscuro face as tears stream down her face and the man teases a lock of her hair. SOMERSAULT is a well handled treatment of a young 16 year old girl's journey through the discovery of her own sexuality and how to separate love from sex through creative encounters and experimentation."
5422,"Jamie Foxx leads a brilliant cast in this powerful voyage through the life of the blind, emotionally troubled, African American genius of pop jazz, Mr. Ray Charles. Though the entire cast performs wonderfully, Mr. Foxx earned more than simply an Oscar. The dramas of Charles' struggles with guilt, the death of his younger brother and mother, blindness, discrimination, addiction, and success, are neatly woven into the tapestries of his music. A big part of the success of this film is its consistent focus on a few persistent themes in Charles' life - his profound love and respect for his mother, his need to be loved and accepted, his addiction and guilt complex, his musical genius, and his deep - seated fear of responsibility for others. Of the four pictures to make it to the race to the Oscars in early 2005 (KINSEY, THE AVIATOR, HOTEL RWANDA, and, RAY), RAY became the big winner of the night as the acting award went to Jamie Foxx for his portrayal of R & B genius Ray Charles."
5411,"He also gets to listen to his father, in a fit of remorse, lecture him on making the most of his senior year because it's all downhill from there and these are the best memories he'll ever have. One thing the movie does extremely well is taking hackneyed plots of the individual players (because it's all been done before) and putting them all in the background. All the actors playing the football players do a good job, especially the guy who plays Boobie. Another unique thing about "" Lights "" is that when watching, it feels like the viewer is watching a documentary, because movie does a great job on including detail on the attitude the town and players carry throughout the story and highlights from EVERY game are shown (something that never happens in sports movies). Actually the most interesting character was the Hispanic defensive back, but the movie didn't do anything with him."
6112,"This section of plot takes up a much greater portion of Haruki Murakami's original short story, and Jun Ichikawa made a wise decision in reducing it, though utmost respect for the source material is in evidence throughout the film. From start to finish, really, the film is an episodic accumulation of small, deeply - touching scenes tied together by very simple yet evocative piano music and the enchanting voice of a narrator (Hidetoshi Nishijima) whose warm, thoughtful delivery makes one think of some poet of a bygone era. Ichikawa solidifies these intense layers of feeling with wonderfully basic techniques: stirring skylines and skyscapes used as backdrops; lovely, tangible environments; and discrete, minimalist camera angles--key conversations shot from behind the characters, over the shoulder, for instance. He finally meets Eiko, a beautiful, demure woman with an even greater obsession - an uncontrollable desire for designer clothes. The technique is intriguing at first but eventually feels contrived, just like the literary conceit of having the characters finish the narrator's sentences (Hidetoshi Nishijima provides the penetrating voice narration throughout the story)."
5413,"Ignore what the critics say and rent this movie out because it is funnier than a lot of Christmas movies. An offbeat comedy and a genuine step forward for the Scrooge remakes that when given the chance to shine in its own right, works quite well. James Gandolfini is very entertaining as the constantly resentful Tom Valco whose only vice, in true Christmas spirit, is money. Nevertheless, there are many positive attributes to this genre subverting film. The entire cast is funny, the story pretty good and the comic moments awesome."
5414,"That's right, this baby is stocked with jump scenes! Some people think jump scenes are cheap ploys to get a scare from the audience, but they're really well done in this movie. THE GIST If you're looking for some Halloween entertainment, then The Grudge will give you some good jumps and surround you with creepy imagery. If you've seen all four of the earlier films, you've really seen everything (except the frightening opening with Bill Pullman) and you'd best wait for home video. definitely going to get this on DVD when it comes out."
5415,"The soundtrack is also superb, made up mostly of new tunes by Mick Jagger and Dave Stewart (of Eurythmics fame). Dig deep inside and find those feelings you didn't think you had, until you realize they were just hiding in the shadows waiting for you to make a move. Caine's golden classic Alfie has had the makeover, with pretty boy Jude Law bought in to ask what it's all about. Not his surroundings (he's in glamorous Manhattan) and his job isn't that bad (still a driver, but look at the perks), and he even likes the kid of one of his girlfriends. In this film the subject of abortion, although delicately handled, has lost it's cinematic impact, which is no doubt due to the three decades that has passed between films."
5416,"The standout performance in the film was Paul Giamatti's. He should have been nominated for American Splendor, and he definitely should have been nominated for Sideways. Thus these two opposites (who are more alike than they appear on first glance) have all sorts of adventures and misadventures. The four leads are remarkable with Church stealing the show and Madsen doing the work of her life. Giamatti's quiet and heartfelt role makes you sympathize and care for this flawed man."
5417,"The very atmospheric nature of the film is supported very strongly by excellent performances all around. Almost everything about the film screams Hitchcock, from the editing of certain scenes (the driving sequences are very much in the style of Psycho) to the Bernard Herrmann - esquire score (lots of bass clarinet), the lack of fully - exploring / revealing some of the creepier points of the film (what is dripping from the fridge?) In that way it is closer to films like Magnolia or the Others, where the apex is the characters. No matter how many pounds he lost, it's a remarkable performance. Director Brad Anderson succeeds brilliantly in conceiving an atmosphere that is so compelling, as one other user on the IMDb stated,' You just HAVE to know what the hell is going on here . '"
5418,"Come to think of it, most of Mike Leigh's movies have this effect. One can see her eyes fill with tears because it suddenly dawns on Vera the immensity of what she has done. But Leigh also makes sure that it's understood that illegal abortions posed high risks to vulnerable women. No melodramatics, no attempt to steal scenes, and the result is as honest as life itself. Vera's home is tiny and the others are so well appointed, it is only natural to assume that Vera will bear a resentment toward her employers, but on the contrary, she is a dignified woman who makes do with her meager wages."
5419,"So, what you get with this movie is a lot of performances that are reasonably strong, a couple of weak ones, and a handful that are just great (Solomon Burke, the Neville Brothers, and the just - too - cool - for - words Clarence "" Gatemouth "" Brown come to mind instantly). The musical performances are all first rate, although, in the interest of time, the sets are much shorter than any real Blues fan would probably like them to be. For blues lovers it's a must see; for those who don't know much about it, this film is a good introduction. For example an incredible version of "" The Sky Is Crying "" by Warren Haynes (one of the greatest white guitarists alive) and the legendary Gregg Allman. If you love the blues, do yourself a favor and see this movie."
5420,"Some scenes come across as ridiculous or absurd, but Undertow is a film that is rich in both symbolism and metaphor and it is necessary to look for the deeper meaning of such scenes. In spite of some repetitive chase scenes and a few superfluous camera tricks, it is Green's best film and deserves more than a limited release. Jamie Bell and Devon Alan as the two brothers are very convincing and easy to route for, and some directorial flourishes from Green and nice character acting from Lucas keep the film fresh and original even as it channels past classics from Malick ("" Badlands ""), Lynch ("" Blue Velvet ""), and the "" Night of the Hunter . "" On top of all that the film is beautifully shot, perfectly acted / cast and the music fits the moods in each scene. The best about the film are its stunning cinematography and performances by Jamie Bell as Chris Munn, the older boy and Josh Lucas as Deel Munn, the boys' uncle whom they never knew."
5421,"Just like' Se7en', there is a H U G E twist that makes your blood curdle. It is well scripted, well acted, and, for everyone who guesses the killer after the first few minutes, keeps you guessing right up to the final reel. "" Saw, "" a film that was originally planned for a straight - to - video release but after receiving positive nods at test screenings, was finally given the green light in October 2004 - just in time for Halloween. "" Saw "" contains one of the those plots that shows you everything it's got up its sleeve, then doubles - back on itself three - fourths of the way through and reveals something entirely new. "" Saw "" will also make you think twice about bladed objects as well."
5423,"The Incredibles is a fantastic story, wonderfully scripted and with the most stunning animation you have ever seen, it provides a perfectly rounded story with plenty of action, laughs and (almost) tears. Add to the mix that some of their children have inherited their own powers and that the Super villains are planning a comeback, and you have this wonderful movie. Definitely with nods to The Fantastic Four, Silver Surfer and huge nods to The Watchmen. The short film showing before this was wonderful in itself, and had the audience laughing out loud loads. The Incredibles does not shy away from being real; it has an amazing message for both adults and children."
5847,"Two writers with opposed views on life argue about it: is life tragic or comic? It features plenty of allenisms and classic Woody situations. There's plenty of characters and they're all very well crafted by the director: the protagonist, Melinda, is both believable in its two sides (tragic and comic). Radha Mitchell is excellent in both parts, switching from comedy to drama smoothly. Ejiofor and Sevigny are also very adequate in their roles."
4968,"The performance of Denzel Wahington was brilliant, this guy continues being an excellent actor and that it continues this way. Although released among a flock of revenge - minded action flicks (KILL BILL VOL. 2; THE PUNISHER; WALKING TALL), MAN ON FIRE works as well as it does thanks in large part to the always - watchable Denzel Washington, one of the best actors around today. Still, he gets help from a very intrepid Mexican newspaper reporter (Rachel Ticotin) out to expose "" La Hermanidad "" (The Brotherhood), the kidnap gang responsible for Fanning's abduction. Although the film overall is quite violent, it is no worse than most action films of the last ten years, and overall it is much better than most. It might be hard on some of you, if you aren't used to reading subtitles (Mexicans do that ALL the time while watching American movies) but the effort will be well worth it."
5426,"The musical numbers and side pieces (especially on the train roof) brought some very effective morality and life lessons to the superb computer animation, giving it that "" touch "" of humanity. Caricatures done convincingly is all the more believable, as The Incredibles has proved. There is much artistry involved here, especially when the night scenes of the train's fast - moving travel through a blustery snowstorm capture some rich winter landscapes, including a frozen lake that threatens to demolish train and passengers before danger has passed. The story is very simple but yet entertains all the way with some very adventurous scenes. Tom Hanks and the others enter into the spirit of the whole thing with gusto--and all the performances are right on target."
5427,"At one point, Kinsey interviews a creepy subject played by William Sadler who has maintained a detailed record of all of the thousands of people he has had sex with (including children) and the implication is clear that he and Kinsey are two sides of the same coin--both justifying their amoral pursuits in the name of intellectual enrichment. Indeed, though a bit of full frontal nudity is supplied by Sarsgaard, he ends up putting his pajamas on before sharing an intimate kiss with Neeson. Perhaps the film's only moment of real sexual tension comes from two Boy Scouts discussing the sins of self gratification. A movie like KINSEY does good in showing both the good and the bad sides of the man because only a person who had this intensity of vision could produce such results at the risk of almost losing not only his immediate family (he comes close to on at least one occasion), but friends and associates. Screenplay writer & director, Bill Condon, who should have won an Oscar for "" Gods and Monsters, "" uses an enticing technique of switching between B&W scenes & color ones."
5428,"After the Sunset is a pretty ordinary movie with some entertaining moments and a lot of gorgeous scenery. AID = / 20041111 / REVIEWS / 41006006 / 1023) involving electro - technical moments, great use of locations, wry humor (Woody Harrelson does go over the top in some mugging moments, but overall is quite engaging), and certainly deserves another opportunity to develop a script. She doesn't really do anything special except look very beautiful."
5429,"First, the positives â€“ Colin and Hugh are still hitting their marks. Colin gets that and twinkles, melts and warms in all the right places. seeing things through her eyes, groaning as she put her foot in her mouth again and cheering for her to finally get it right. Oh look, matching Christmas jumpers â€“ how cute. Most of the funny in this movie comes from certain' episodes' as opposed to the dialogue."
5430,"Yours, is a performance of perfect beauty. Although the film deserves all the praise it gets, it is understandable that moviegoers are a little weary with another dramatic period piece, with another "" oscar caliber "" cast, about yet another take on Peter Pan. Exploring the major theme of Barrie's play (that of a boy who never grows up), Finding Neverland refrains from condemning grown - ups, but exalts the wild magic one can enjoy as a kid. The boys playing the Davis kids are a lot of fun to watch and play their dramatic parts perfectly. If you want something where all the pieces of the magic puzzle that is movie - making come together with grace, charm, and humanity, you won't find a more rewarding film than this."
5431,"The whole thing is paced just right, the villains are just bad enough, and the goodies are nobles with a roguish streak. together with Riley, they provided the tickles that brought the audience through the entire film. the history behind the show may not be accurate and it also has around it, an air of mystery, but it certainly was a fun filled ride with the face - paced action flicks! Well paced with some good action scenes that will keep you hooked all the way through. This is a film that will play well with young minds and with adults that will allow for the silliness of the situation at hand."
5432,"It's hilarious, particularly the part where Spongebob and Patrick are blowing bubbles and an earlier part where they're eating ice cream extra fast (spoiler alert). But he's right, SpongeBob is a funny movie in it's own quirky, original way. Take the funniest things about Spongebob Squarepants (wacky - anarchist environment and extremely funny animated drawings) and make it an hour - and - a-half long. It's non-stop laughs and plenty of color and all - out craziness. There's a certain amount of slapstick and visual gags, but the dialogue and situations are fine too."
5433,"But when two men lie together in purity, they can perform wonders. Stone is hypothesizing that Hephaistion was essential for what Alexander did. Farrel really looks a lot like Ryan O'Neil in Barry Lyndon. In a lot of scenes it made sense. Because it was made by a visionary about another visionary, because it is true to itself, to the legacy, to history, because it doesn't sell off, because it is not your typical popcorn blockbuster, and most of all because, steering away from creating a cartoon - like, hollow and fake "" Super-Man "" (Troy's Achilles) it focuses on the Man Alexander."
5434,"The real coup would have been scoring interviews with surviving members Bill and Emily Harris or Hearst herself - although her lack of participation is quite understandable given that her version of the case is already well documented. The film comes ready - made with the gripping narrative of a thriller - and proves the clichÃ© correct that truth is much stranger than fiction. Altogether, it is a gripping and often darkly funny insight into one of the strangest cases in pop culture as well as the annuls of crime. After almost two years of living with the' enemy,' the precious Patty Hearst was released. Compare that to those people without money and a powerful family - they went to jail for years."
5435,"Natalie Portman, in a tour - de-force performance, is the standout by far. Julia Roberts stars as Anna in a cold, subtle performance which will leave audiences appreciating her acting believability as she pounces through each of her scenes with charismatic force. Mike Nichols presents it in an amazing way, very faithful to the words as they're written (and they should be, for the movie is also written by the man who wrote the play, the brilliant Patrick Marber). It's high drama - with all the uplifting romance and brutal arguments of relationships. She comes alive with the two guys, and their scenes are ones to look forward to."
6710,"Oh yeah, add to that some late night Euro soft - core sex movies and a monthly magazine that provided the kind of insight you now find on IMDb with full cast lists and turkey alerts, 20 years before the internet. That is a long way to get around to an opinion but here goes: The interviews are great. The documentary drops hints that the fall of Z Channel parallels the demise of Mr. Harvey. Yes, there are some wonderful interviews with Robert Altman, Vilmos Zsigmond and Quentin Tarantino (who, ironically, lived OUTSIDE its subscription area and could only experience it vicariously through a friend's VHS dubs!) as well as some scattershot clips from various movies that were carried on the station."
5437,"So, Zhang Yimou, please bring on more heroes and flying daggers "" Shi mian mai fu "" is a beautiful romantic adventure, with amazing clothing, cinematography, colors, music score, fight and martial arts choreography and special effects. There are enough plot twist, double crossings and romance to keep the scenes between the action sequences interesting. Yimou sets a number of scenes within symmetrically perfect backgrounds, the picture set up like a work of art. In contrast to Hero's coda, where the action became about what's doing right for the good of the whole country, House of Flying Daggers has one of a more personal nature."
5438,"' Oceans 12' was a very fun, but at the same time flawed, movie. The movie was every film students dream come true, full of indie style camera and editing tricks from beginning to end. The storyline was entertaining and full of just as many twists and turns as had graced the first one. By far the strong suit of the film was the cast and their generally above par performances. After the success of the remake of Ocean's Eleven, out comes the sequel three years later."
5439,"stated: "" Blade 1 & 2 kicked ass and was in a class of it's own in the action / comic book movie genera! "" Pros â€“ Cool new weapons & some plucky comedy. The first two were exciting, with punchy dialogue, impressive villains and most importantly, a hero, the man himself, Blade. Two strong villains for Blade to fight against. Those good old days of Blade kicking ass are gone, replaced by Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds beating down brittle MTV vampires that couldn't hold a candle to Stephen Dorff's Deacon Frost."
5441,"However, "" Bush's Brain "" shows that Georege W. Bush does indeed have a brain working for him; it just happens to be within the head of another individual. By equating genuine questions by everyday citizens about the legitimacy of the war in Iraq with not being patriotic, Rove has set up a dynamic where intelligent discussion of foreign policy is difficult, if not almost impossible. Rove is part of Bush's advisory team and several people in this film see Rove as wielding as much influence over Bush's decision making as a prime minister. The Rove doctrine, simply stated, is that' A true American either supports Bush and the Republican party or he is labeled a traitor' (Democrats and dissenting Republicans included). One of the most interesting anecdotes concerning Rove's political methods is that Rove once planted a' bug' in his own office during a campaign and alerted the press so that his candidate would receive sympathy votes."
6758,"McDonagh is a brilliant story teller and fully deserves his Tony nominations and his Olivier Award for Best Play (The Pillowman). This film is beautifully acted by Brendon Gleeson and especially RÃºaidhrÃ­ Conroy, sharply photographed, and well directed by McDonagh himself. The cast is uniformly excellent, especially Brendan Gleeson as the sad - eyed protagonist and RÃºaidhrÃ­ Conroy as a ticking time - bomb of a kid."
5452,"In doing so, little did the powers that be considered what a small Arab news network would do to tell viewers in that part of the world about what they perceived was going on. Up to that point, Al Jazeera was considered an enemy by most Arab states in the region because in their way of thinking. Egyptian - born, Harvard - educated director Jehane Noujaim, having worked with D. A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus on"" Only the Strong Survive"" and"" Startup. ' Lt. Rushing is one of the more interesting characters, at first a central - casting officer spouting the Pentagon message."
4967,"If you're looking for a great way to invest 100 minutes of your life, see From 13 to 30. Jennifer Garner, transported from a 13 year old girl into her 30 year old future self, gives a thoroughly appealing performance which is backed up with strong support from the likes of Mark Ruffallo, Judy Greer and Andy Serkis. The fashion of both eras is spot on, although Jenna's fondness for Rick Springfield and Michael Jackson's Thriller is more 1984 than 1987. Not that the other players weren't good - Mark Ruffalo came off great here and the rest of the cast was fine, no problems with anyone, it's just that the story (or the telling of it) wasn't exactly original or inspired. Garner and Ruffalo work well as the leads in this good old family values bop flick which keeps the momentum up 'til the very warm and fuzzy end."
4966,"No, it's anything but a thinking man's movie, but it IS entertaining and harmless if you look at everything tongue - in - cheek. The sometimes - juvenile but interesting action scenes, the diverse characters in here and the humor all combine to make this better than anticipated. This is by far the best film in the reinvigorated sub-genre of comic - book - to - screen conversions. Heck, if you just like movies in general, The Punisher is two hours well - spent. So far this is probably the best of the non - X - Men / Spider - Man Marvel movies."
5675,"It tells the tale of an emotionally wrecked man, Chow Mo Wan (played by Tony Leung), a reprised character from Wong's critically acclaimed earlier oeuver, _ In the Mood for Love (2000) _, and the many beautiful women he keeps and fails to keep, in a time - space continuance that is laden with sepia - tinted memories: a monologue, if you will, of Chow's torrid love affairs, love spats, and the ensuing heartbreaks resulting, no doubt, from the pangs of a failed liaison Chow is trying to escape. This film can still be watched on its own, though it'd certainly help if you could link moments in _ 2046 _ to the director's earlier works, for it's laden with jumbled continuity (take the character of Lulu, for example, first seen in _ Days of Being Wild (1991) _), hidden meanings (read: Neo-Godardian) and other fun stuff, sorta an insider's joke, if you dig such esoteric things. In _ 2046 _, Chow's isn't an easily likable character owing to the frailty and the vagaries of his own personal emotions and peccadilloes, but that makes him only human and real, and his character, believable. The actors in every role include many of the finest actors available: Li Gong, Ziyi Zhang, Carina Lau, Maggie Cheung, Takuya Kimura, Chen Chang, and of course Tony Leung. Without the strong performances from them all, in particular Ziyi, Lau and Cheung, the drama just wouldn't be there, and certainly the style giving much weight to the film would become over-cooked and pretentious."
4965,""" Vol. 1 "" had a lot of blood, violence, and wisecracks, and galloped across the screen like a rap video on steroids. Director Tarantino has fun stylistically quoting Sergio Leone and chop - fu cheapos from the late 1960s and early 1970s. Madsen's good, though, and so's Daryl Hannah as another rather mouthy assassin, Gordon Liu as Pei Mei, and especially Perla Haney - Jardine as a girl named B. B. This one fight scene is almost as exciting as watching the Bride battling off tons of the Crazy 88s from Vol. 1."
4964,"On that basis, the movie delivers a lot of entertainment - many out - loud laughs and a variety of entertaining songs. Nia Vardalos also sings sufficiently well, and her easy, comic manner nicely leavens the somewhat hysterical character played by Collette. Together, the actresses are genuinely entertaining as they work their way through the list of Broadway standards. It was almost a continual smile everytime you thought about the movie. Nia Vardalos will never win an acting award, but still has fun developing her own roles that she clearly writes for herself."
4953,"That being said, original script writer Mitchell Kapner has managed to put together a film that makes good use of its absurd plot and characters, and somehow manages to be enjoyable despite feeling completely superfluous. Bruce Willis returns as Jimmy "" The Tulip "" Tudeski, who's now living in obscurity with his wife, Jill (Amanda Peet). In The Whole Ten Yards, there is a scene that makes a reference to Hughes' Planes, Tranes & Automobiles (1987), but let's just say that it was more funnier when Steve Martin and John Candy did it."
5850,"Also the selection of the four bowlers to highlight was a great choice as they all were so different. Best of all, the filmmakers have chosen several bowlers to profile that encompass almost everything the sport represents while managing to incorporate the requisite' drama' that separates exciting docu - tainment like this from your ordinary, average sports documentary. Amidst this laid - back milieu the Professional Bowlers Association began to cultivate a more refined interest in the game for those bowlers capable of consistent' perfect' games (that's a 300 score). Williams and Weber have made millions of dollars bowling and to the bowling world, they are two of the greatest living bowlers, but you rarely see the other side. The toll this lifestyle takes on the players and their families is well presented."
4952,"Aidan McArdle (Slannen the Elf) is wonderful comic relief each and every time he appears, as is Lucy Punch as the horrid Step - Sister and chief fan - girl (shudder). Ella Enchanted, starring Anne Hathaway, Hugh Dancy, Minnie Driver, and Eric Idle, is a contemporary epic fairy tale, sitting on the top shelf with such classics as The Wizard of Oz, and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. A deeply telling and romantic tale, set in the land of magic, with many important messages, ranging from personal freedom, self empowerment, truth, and equality, to the simple pleasures that create the beautiful contrast of fairy tales, humor, song, beauty, friendship. A family movie, Ella Enchanted will be enjoyed by adults and children, and is sure to bring a warmth to your heart. The supporting roles are cute, witty, and fill out the movie in all the right places."
4951,"But the most amazing aspect of these reviews is the repeated accusation of lack of character development. The creation of the set near Wimberly Texas, forty miles north of San Antonio, permitted excellent views of Texas scenery that most settlers would have seen. Some untold truths left off the film are worthy of mention: 1. The decision to acquire recognition of Texas as a nation required an acting head of state to preside, so the United States was chosen. Also, for the first time, the Tejanos who fought against their brothers and sisters in the Texas cause are well represented."
4950,"Obviously, in these type of movies the good guys always have to win, so it's really important that the director make sure the good guys come out looking much better than the bad guys so that when the good guys win, the audience is satisfied. That being said, for action junkies there's definitely something here for you, with The Rock getting into it with his hands, and guns, there's definitely something for everyone. Fabulous fight scenes, a tense script and some funny moments all are reminiscent of the numerous Chuck Norris movies that portrayed a quiet guy that doesn't take any bull - crap from nobody man! There are still some traditional action scenes, but for the most part it keeps it grounded and tells a good tale that does give you a warm feeling. The cinematography is very good, and there are some interesting things done with sound and unexpected fade - outs."
4948,"Roseanne provided a funny voice to one of the cows. Maybe there are faster or cheaper ways of making these movies, but a great history is coming to an end. This one must surely have sent Walt Disney spinning in his grave to see how the current regime has cheapened everything he worked so hard to build! The likes of' Snow White',' Pinnochio,' Bambi' and those like it are apparently gone for good! It's worth noting that the other failed animated movies of recent years have all attempted to do the same kind of feel - good, blatant targeting."
4947,"When Agent Myers goes for a walk wit Liz Hellboy gets jealous and follows them over rooftops where he encounters a nine year old boy. The boy recognizes Hellboy and the scenes that follow the encounter are close to brilliant. ' Spider - Man 2' did a perfect job,' X2',' Blade II' and now' Hellboy' come very close. So he has a large number of human - like quirks, including a love of old music, beer, cats, pancakes, chili, and so on. One moment Hellboy is giving away some great, fun and cool one - liners and the next he's fighting a monster in the subway."
4944,"The first cinematic outing for Scooby and the gang was just above average, the effects were decidedly varied in quality and there was far too much time given to moments of puerile humour (yes, kids do like the odd fart gag but there are better ways they can be done). The humor has also been improved and this movie actually does have some entertaining and funny moments in it. There are a number of such scenes that really hit the animated button and is a treat to actually see it transferred onto the large screen with real actors. But to tell the truth this film handled the characters better and the climax more interesting, at least in terms of the identity of the villain. The story is better and more interesting and the monsters and CGI - effects in general are more convincing looking."
4943,"Retellings don't need to improve, dazzle, or impress by comparison--they simply are what they are, and this was enjoyable. There are some great laugh out loud moments of pure slapstick and some nice subtle touches of more gentle humour. Spoilers Falling short of a Coen masterpiece (such a Fargo), The Ladykillers can be described as a Coen gem. Equally sparkling is the audio pleasure proffered, with the beautiful background of barber - shop like chorus leading into an on screen duet of snores of the sheriff and his deputy. While on that score (no pun intended), lively, exciting swinging gospel music provides excellent interludes as well as background throughout."
6762,"That and the fact that the director worked on "" FLCL . "" They proceed to then get some clothes, steal a car and lead the police on a wild, gun - blazing, high - speed chase which ends in their arrests. Not for the straitlaced or faint of heart, Dead Leaves' mere 52 minutes zoom by at break - neck speed in a flurry of explosions, gore, sex and nudity, but if you can stomach the off - the - wall content you're in for a very enjoyable if lamentably brief anime experience."
6080,"if you were looking for a thrilling, fast paced roller - coaster, that's what you will find. Sure, B13 is derivative, but it is certainly more exciting than another "" re-imagining "" of a 70s cop show. Cyril Raffaelli (who attended the screening) is a long - time associate of Besson, mainly working stunts or as a body double in a number of movies such as Double Team and Ronin before moving on to acting in films such as Kiss of the Dragon (where he can be seen fighting Jet Li in the climax) and Crimson Rivers 2. David Belle is an interesting choice in that he is the founder of Le Parkour, a movement where people try to move from point A to point B as fast as possible, in the most fluid manner as possible, without stopping, and always moving forward, never backward. If you've seen the street chase scene in Ong - Bak: The Thai Warrior and thought that it was a refreshing change from all the wire work present in most action films today, that pales in comparison to the chase scenes in Banlieue 13."
6078,"For all you folks out there that dismiss older films, you may be surprised by your favorite directors such as Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg and James Cameron praising the magnificence of silent films and many classics. This is one of the two feature - length documentaries on the 2 - Disc Special Edition DVD of Bullitt. Without these classics and the skill involved in making them, today's movies wouldn't be what they are. Many different aspects of film editing are extensively covered in fascinating detail: montage, juxtaposition, jump cuts, creating a rhythm, the challenge of cutting chase sequences, the importance of sound, the powerful fusion of sound and image, fragmenting time and space, the difficulty of cutting sex scenes, and the contemporary style of rapid - fire fast cutting. Jumping from the ingenuity of a filmmaker devising an editing trick to rally people to a political viewpoint, to popcorn movies about surface stimulation and box office receipts is so reductivist as to be offensive."
5919,"The producers were able to turn back the clock on Hamilton in a convincing way, with the appropriate prudishness of dress and behaviour for the private catholic school community in the mid - '50s. "" Saint Ralph "" is one of the best things that have come out of Canada in recent years. The excellent Gordon Pinsent, makes the perfect head master Father Fitzpatrick, a man who is never in touch with the young people he is supposed to lead and help shape their minds into being good citizens. It approaches the "" inspirational "" movie genre (think everything from Rocky to Chariot's of Fire) but manages to evoke a genuine and unique flavour in the form. The characters are well developed, the plot intriguing and inviting, and the dialogue simply priceless."
5702,"(noting: Exception of the "" Competition "") They expect the audience to Believe that a couple of disgruntled cheerleaders can have a "" try out "" get a bunch of activists together and uh Bribe them with the Winnings into suddenly being able to do all the moves and flips and such that Competing cheer leaders do? If you are into cheerleading you'll most likely enjoy it. Don't be mislead by the title, because other than cheerleading, this movie has little (actually, nothing) to do with "" Bring It On "". it says something like "" with a group of rising, up - and - coming new stars ""."
5703,"The final confrontation between the starring and the contenders in the Â¨ Maginot line Â¨ tunnels is spellbinding. The motion picture will appeal to religious thriller buffs and dark atmosphere enthusiasts. Olivier Dahan tries to build on the success of the first' Rivieres pourpres' and brings back Jean Reno in a second series which has little in common with the first film, unfortunately. RiviÃ¨res Pourpres 1 was better than 2 because in the first there were much more suspense elements. Jean Reno made a solid job in his part as the cop Niemans and cool role of the horror legend Christopher Lee."
5713,"This movie changes many of King's original notions, but maintains the heart and soul of his book. The first fifteen or twenty minutes, introduced by the Lowe character with a steady and pointed commentary, brilliantly introduces the story's characters while it's signaling the movie's main conflict. The remake of this movie could have used the mild Alfred Hitchcock flare of the original to instill fear in viewers while indeed focusing on the major characters as the book did to tell a captivating story."
5705,"Like Harry Potter, the Lemony Snicket books appeal to adults as well as to children but they are darker, funnier and more eccentric, making them more of a cult than the mainstream success of the Harry Potter series. Taking place against backdrops reminiscent of Masaki Kobayashi's stylish horror classic Kwaidan, Lake Lachrymose is as beautiful as it is nightmarish. The emphasis in this film seemed to be on the art - the costumes, sets, lighting, FX, properties, even the creative and amusing end credits (if you get the opportunity, sit through them). Visually it was a very strong film, a fantastic film to feast one's eyes upon. The end credits is a ten minute long cartoon of such incredible beauty that it is a great shame that most people will never watch it."
7246,"On the original Special Edition DVD set, this is well worth watching. Anyway, this is an enjoyable documentary to watch if you are a fan of the Star Wars trilogy. If you're a fan of "" Star Wars, "" definitely check this out - if you don't want to dish out the cash, it's playing on A&E right now. John William's masterful main title and subsequent scoring forever changed the musical landscape of contemporary movies for the better. A memorizing fairytale, and by now legendary intergalactic epic from which all subsequent like - minded endeavors have had to live up to, "" Star Wars "" was the story of the son of a Jedi Knight, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and his quest to rid the galaxy of an evil empire and Darth Vader."
6032,"As in many great movies it is love that redeems and brings back human feelings to where they should be. Kusturica builds a world of characters who are tragic and funny, colorful and overall avid to live a life despite of the vicissitudes of history. Kusturica repeats himself, it's the first thing that comes to mind when leaving the cinema. This political assumption is one of the strongest elements of the movie, but is Kusturica's carnaval reinforcing or diluting this powerful message? For those who have already seen other Kusturica movies, this one will clearly be seen as a further step in the evolution of a great director."
5707,"The whole film has a very dreamlike aura to it and the colors are great. What makes this such a strange paradox is that the war scenes in "" A Very Long Engagement "" are possibly even more graphic and outrageous than those of SPR, but it works just because Jeunet adds his surreal touch to everything. And the way these scenes unfold are incredibly spellbinding. Jeunet's style seems so much more natural and mature here as compared to the somewhat forced' weirdness' (or quirkiness) of Amelie. The ending was mesmerizing, paralyzing, and when the credits came on not a single person even got up for a few minutes."
5884,"His best friend at the napola is the Governor's son - sensitive, caring, humane and opposed to Nazi dogma, he is obviously in the wrong place but has no choice but to fulfill his dad's wishes. Another person commenting on this page is angry that the film is misleading from his genuine Napola experience and it is well worth reading his comments as he was actually there in 38 - 42. Not unlike Dead Poets Society but in a Nazi sports academy instead, NAPOLA features an exceptionally good looking cast and really absorbing locations and detail. But for a look into a thrilling and brutal world of elite Nazi sports and harsh idealism, NAPOLA is a very commercial and visually successful film. It is no surprise that Napola won various awards for film, acting and direction, It's rich cinematography and haunting soundtrack brings to life Nazi Germany of 1942, and highlighting the horrors of the training of an elitist school of soldiers and future governors, with its expected training tragedies."
5885,"This is probably Solondz' bleakest movie to date, despite moments of (very dark) humour. It's best to be familiar with Dollhouse first before watching Palindromes. Upon this journey Aviva is played by many different actresses, all of whom portray her with the same facial expressions and mannerisms. In terms of film - making, it is fairly innovative in technique, although audiences who have tired of director Todd Solondz's previous offerings (which include' Storytelling' and' Happiness') may say it is more of the same thing. Aviva (her name is palindromic - spelt the same forwards or backwards) is 12 or 13 years old but has a very strong desire to have a baby."
5710,"This is the irony of their situation: she must capitulate to the conventions of their culture in order to gain some freedom from it, and he must capitulate to society in order to get some sense of purpose. The actors are strong, especially Birol Ãœnel, whose charismatic brooding and ravaged good looks make him irresistibly watchable. There's also a loud, authentic - feeling rock - pop soundtrack and a cunning contrast between Cahit's punk - rock sensibility and Sibel's love of good grooming and dance. Nobody could play Sibel better than Sibel Kekilli. the two leads who play Cahit and Sibel are just amazing, Birol Unel especially manages to convey the despair, self loathing and loneliness of his character with a physicality that's just striking."
5711,"It is without a doubt one of the most visually engaging animes ever created. Mamoru Oshii and his crew did a masterful job creating a worthy successor to their 1995 adaptation of Masamune Shirow's original manga. Like in the first movie, Oshii lets the movie halt at times, immersing the viewer in the richly detailed world he created. Some of the interaction between the Section 9 members is quite amusing, as in later on in the movie when, after Togusa has rattled off one too many quotes, Bateau tells him he can barely understand their conversation, with all the obscure references and all. The colors are wonderful, ranging from a washed out sepia coloring in some aerial shots to dark but rich tones in several night scenes to amazingly vibrant and bright colors in a fantastic parade scene."
4942,"Ben Athleck switches in and out of competence a few too many times to make his performance IMO a completely solid one but frankly he does a good job of holding all the disparate threads of the movie together. Raquel Castro manages to give a real performance even though some of her reactions are clearly forced. Affleck and George Carlin have some funny moments with and without the daughter. The two guys who are not Gertie's uncles are funny. Moving to his father's house in a Jersey suburb, Ollie and his daughter Gertie try to get accustomed to the new lifestyle as Ollie meets a local woman (Liv Tyler) who helps change his look on life."
5714,"This is a very clever film with a lot to say about life, death, sex, human relationships, human fragility and loneliness - but it does it all with a wonderfully light hearted touch. Luchini dancing just has to be one of the best scenes - eat your heart out Hugh Grant! The most wonderful insight of this film, though, is that paying taxes and dealing with deep disturbing psychological issues have similar concerns - what do you declare and what do you try desperately to hide? "" Confidences trop intimes "" is a brilliant film directed by Patrice Leconte, with two big French actors - Fabrice Luchini and Sandrine Bonnaire. The film is an intimate comedy, action is made by good dialogs."
4941,"Whether this was a smart career choice for Ms. Jolie is debatable. Kiefer Sutherland was in the movie for about five minutes yet he gets top billing. At almost an hour and fifty minutes, the film is too long; and a better editing job is definitely in order. Although watchable, "" Taking Lives "" feels like a weak - spined, half - hearted effort in an already played - out genre. Hawke does his best with the material, though there really isn't much he can do with it apart from going through the motions, which he does reasonably well."
5717,"J. R. Bourne does well as the second - in - command, but his character is just two - dimensional, the a â€” hole dimension and the d â€” chebag dimension. The first is classic; wonderful acting, very clever story, realistic - looking werewolves, the humor in it was great and the scenery and style was just terrific. The make - up of the werewolves is excellent. Ginger Snaps also introduced Katharine Isabelle and Emily Perkins, two talented, beautiful and utterly believable actresses. And an excuse to watch two talented actresses portray Ginger and Brigitte."
5718,"As played by Daniel Hendler, Ariel is an adorable slacker who thinks the solution to his ennui is to become European but ends up searching this community for his full identity and heritage--as a Jew, as a grandson of Polish immigrants, as a mother's son, as a son of a father in Israel, as a lover, a brother, friend and Argentinian. His loving relationship with his brightly henna - haired mother as he helps out at her lingerie shop is both unusually sweet and mature and a nice counter-point to how Jewish mothers are usually portrayed. While his quest greatly impacts the others he questions as each makes important changes in habits, it is a bit confusing that the more Ariel gradually learns about his history and just how entwined he is in his community, the less he is able to assimilate it into his image of himself. Daniel Hendler, does a wonderful job in portraying Ariel, the young man who wants to do just the opposite of what his family did: return to Poland. "" Abrazo partido "" is a very subtle, true to life story about the middle classes in Buenos Aires after the economic crisis 2001."
7639,"Even the simple joys of life unleash that monster that swells inside of Dylan. He makes the audience titter with nervous laughter continuously with his quips and well executed improvisations. Its like going to the pub with a couple of mates and the conversation you have with them is full of humorous quips till somebody levels the whole lot of you with the one liner to beat them all. He is charming and clever with his audience and moves quickly from topic to topic, so that although the show only went for an hour and a half it seems infinitely diverse and rich. Moran has a problem with everything and he's going to tell you about it in a very funny manner."
4940,"It is a tribute to Carrey and Winslet that they were able to do the same. Kate Winslet is consistently brilliant in every film. Kate Winslet is also brilliant as his unpredictable, adventurous girlfriend. Carrey and Winslet did a perfect job acting as Joel and Clementine respectively. This is Jim Carrey's best performance to date, and may open the eyes of his prejudiced haters who have only imagined him as Ace Ventura and a certain cable guy for his entire career."
5721,"One does not expect to see the director of acclaimed drug abuse and zombie movies come out with such wholesome entertainment. The story is told from the children' s' point of view, bright with color, and those children give extraordinary performances. The use of stop - motion and accelerated exposures is characteristic of a style Boyle enjoys, and it accents the scenes where it is employed well. There are moments of comedy, of suspense, and thought - provoking elements. Alex Etel is perfectly cast as a saint obsessed young boy who has a bag of cash fall into lap."
8480,"The changing of actors for the same character which was sad and very noticeable in Z2 has happened in Z3, with a new Proto Zoa. The best thing of the 3 movies is the special futuristic language."
5723,"In the past few months, a bunch of direct - to - video sequels to highly successful movies have been released. The original STARSHIP TROOPERS was a big - budget extravaganza with a budget around $105 million. The best actors are the female Sgt (so much like Sgt Apone in Aliens), the girl who survives (who looks far too much like Lara Croft for her own good) and the general who's down and fighting with his men. A character like his is very rare in real combat (but someone like Col H Jones in The Falkland combat is a good comparison). This film has few locations but makes the best of them."
4939,", there are lots of great twists and snappy dialogue along with the required creep - outs, gore, and slaughter. It's a much needed laugh to relieve the audience of a lot of built - up jitters. There a few unexpected surprises that even the most attentive viewer will take pleasure in. It, like the zombies, moves fast and brutally throughout and is very, very tense. Now you have to admit, that line really can't fit perfectly in to many movies but in the ever consistent mood of Dawn of the Dead, it's right at home."
6020,"The performances of some of the actors could be better and the low budget sometimes shows through, but it is such a unique idea and the discussions it causes are so enlightening, that the filmmaker should be given an award just for bravery. It could be a documentary shown on A & E from its meticulous attention to detail to make it look authentic, and its segues into "" commercial breaks "" are fantastic--you laugh, but you cringe. As the title suggests, this elaborate satire has as it's premise that the South won the Civil War, overran the Union States - and then incorporated them into an uber - Confederacy where slavery is not only preserved but expanded. In an alternate universe, Jefferson Davis became president, the Confederates won the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln was not shot and killed but becomes an escapee in blackface and dies in disgrace in Canada (not before recording his last words in 1905--a little anachronistic since sound in films did not occur until the 1920s), and slavery is alive and well and becoming one with technology. The broadcast is interspersed with wickedly funny commercials for products such as "" Darky "" toothpaste, "" Sambo "" motor oil, and public service spots urging the public to notify the "" Office of Racial Identity "" about non-whites who are attempting to "" pass "" as Caucasian to avoid enslavement."
6463,"One of the most enjoyable screenings at this years Frameline SF Lesbian and Gay Film Festival. In his first venture into film, DORIAN BLUES, he has created an intelligent script with razor sharp dialogue, witty and acerbic and touching depending on the moment, and has cast his film with a fine groups of actors who obviously hold him in great respect, as the final product is a polished film that is always entertaining as well as informative. Dorian Lagatos (a fresh and talented Michael McMillian) is sour on the world that doesn't understand him. His family is the microscope on his world: a right wing radical father Tom (Charles Fletcher), a seemingly ditsy but subservient mother Maria (Mo Quigley), and a brother Nicky (another bright and hunky talent Lea Coco) who is everything Dorian isn't - a jock, a ladies' man, and a happy - go - lucky high schooler. With his discovery he finds some solace from another edgy gay friend Spooky (Austin Basis) but still feels he must remain in the closet."
6039,"But to actually sit through the film, and most importantly, to be subjected to another of Paddy Consadines' electric performances, is an extra-ordinarily vital, if viceral experience. In' A Room for Romeo Brass' Considines character shifted from comical to threatening in a truly unsettling way, although in the end his promise' to go dark on you' is easily thwarted by the decisive action and confidence of a father - figure. Totally believable, and the drug dealers (Gary Stretch and others) are fantastic support too. The killings are well thought out, scary and well paced throughout. Being only 86 minutes long helps a lot too, as the movie runs at a brisk pace, just right for it's genre."
5728,"All the kids are pitch - perfect, especially the young actress who plays the Clasky's daughter, Bernice. For example, when Florrr's (played by Paz Vega) cousin, Cecilia hit the sliding glass door and her nose bled, the wife Deborah Clasky (played by Tia Leone) offered her money instead. All the female actresses, young and old, are absolutely terrific, and Adam Sandler does a respectable job in a semi-serious role. It's interesting to note, the husbands character's last name is Clasky - possibly his ancestors were immigrants as well. James L. Brooks, the writer / director of "" Spanglish "", shows why he is one of the top people working in movies today with this tale about class difference."
5891,"Set over a 24 - hour period in contemporary L. A., it is a social commentary on the interconnectedness of life in the big city. Crash features a top - notch ensemble cast which includes: Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Jennifer Esposito, Brendan Fraser, Chris "" Ludacris "" Bridges, Loretta Devine, Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillipe and Larenz Tate. All put in superb performances in a tight script which is at once gritty, heartwarming, shocking, tragic and witty, and which will ring true with viewers of all demographics. Each of the dozen or so main characters undergoes some type of a personal metamorphosis as the various story lines head toward a striking, common conclusion, which succeeds at being both cathartic and unsettling. "" Crash "" is a complex movie with a simple premise: set in Los Angeles it follows 8 main characters (and many, many more supporting) from all walks of life and races whose lives intersect at some point during one 24 hour period."
5730,"The success of Les choristes as a film (with or without the divine music) lies in its not trying to be anything more than what it is, a simple tale that opens up to you instead of manipulating you. Purely the celestial beauty of the music alone will brings tears to the appreciative audiences' eyes. But the ultimate magic is the choir and boy soprano Jean - Baptiste Maunier chosen from two thousand auditions. If you like this movie recommend it to others as it deserves to find its audience. However, the former deals with the devil which is pretty disturbing while the latter the angels that touches the viewers' heart and soul."
4932,"job of portraying what top - level soldier / drones are like: emotionally neutral, physically economical, and not always all that bright. More surprising than the impressive stylistic touches was perhaps the moments of action, which Mamet delivers with real tension and pace â€“ not bad for a playwright!"
5892,"Rajskub is so good that she gives the other actors in the film a space to react that is almost visible. Words can only reveal so much, while Araki's images display an almost unbearable amount of visceral material, exploiting vibrant color, alluring texture, dark and light, the brooding and harrowing eyes of Joseph Gordon - Levitt, and the handsome modesty of Brady Corbet. Neil eventually moves to New York, while his pining friend Eric (Jeff Licon) actually befriends Brian and an endearing friendship ensues. A long way from "" 3rd Rock "", Joe's sensuous flirtations and dynamic eyes mate well with Brady's tranquil, naive, yet profound, disposition. The lead performances by Brady Corbet and Joseph Gordon Levitt are terrific."
5733,"The director, Ian Iqbal Rashid, was present and provided a wonderful Q&A following the showing. There were many funny moments between "" Cary "" and Alim. The issue of responsibility to parents and family versus following ones own feelings about how to live was also touched on. Throw in enticing sets and wonderful costuming and you've got magic going on. A huge fan of vintage movies, Alim has created an imaginary best friend, in the form of Cary Grant (Kyle MacLachlan), who is always at hand to give him advice on what clothing to wear and how to wear them, often helping him out of awkward social situations."
5734,"Layer Cake isn't gloriously entertaining or anything but it feels very real and engaging and it is interesting to see the acting abilities of future Mr Bond - as well as his bare chest. It is a much greater accomplishment that the audacious visual style, superb script and excellent performances make easy comparisons to this film pretty difficult. Layer Cake deserves a wide audience and there's more than enough of everything for everyone to enjoy. Still the humour and action set pieces are enough to pull it through. The rest of the performances are pretty good."
7804,Interviews with pretty much everyone (well the main players) who had to do with the film.
5736,"This is surprising when the rest of the tension building moments are so much better formed. In the original the blond hared blue eyed bespectacled trouble maker was a German called Dorfman, who menacingly portrayed the stereotype of Nazi arrogance and superiority who audiences back in 1965 (20 years after the war) could easily hate; yet he turned out to be the hero in the end. In the original "" Flight of the Phoenix "", there are several aspects of the film that are essential to the movie; the complete absence of women, the contrast of the claustrophobic setting of the crash site against the vastness of the desert, the lack of backstory for the characters, the revealing of the hidden hopes and fears of the characters through pure dialogue, and the total isolation of the men from outside influences (with the exception of the encounter with the Bedouins.) Almost 40 years after the original the 2005 version shows how much the world has changed. The original, which is a longer movie, is superior in portraying the hopelessness of their predicament as well as the underlying tensions between the survivors."
5737,"But Estes eschews the conventions of the genre to give his characters unexpected depth and create an engrossing morality play. The moral issues they face are real and complex; the crises they create are dealt with expertly. Culkin again is convincing as a skittish young boy being picked on by the school bully, but the two startlingly brilliant performances are by Josh Peck as the bully George, and Carly Schroeder as Millie, the young girl unexpectedly dragged into the plot. George becomes likable, someone who seems to resort to bullying to hide inadequacies of his own. Her Millie is mature way beyond her years."
4931,"It's obvious Stephen King knows exactly what's going on in Mort Rainey's mind, and Koepp, a successful and busy screenwriter, probably connected with the material for the same reason. This film's pace and dark style is meant to reflect horror films of the 40's, 50's, 60's and early 70's before gore became cool but that makes this film such a joy to watch and study. King sticks pretty close to only two methods, but his genius is that he blurs the mechanics so that you suspect through the story it may be one of the more interesting methods. Within the pages are passages literally identical to those from Mort's own book, "" Secret Window, "" published in 1994, three years before John claims he wrote his. Meanwhile the co-stars all deliver fine, convincing performances and although the grand finale is a bit of a let - down, and terribly predictable, the movie's style is interesting."
5918,"The' lesbian' angle was handled deftly - though as another user commented, it would be good to see a film which manages to trace the intensity of female adolescent friendships without having them be sexual in nature - but this is a very special time, and the film caught that beautifully. This film is a near perfect rendition of an oft told tale of growing pains and confused adolescent feelings and is so delightfully rendered as to make any further comment superfluous. As in' Last Resort', Russian - born Pavlikovski paints an enticingly skewed picture of Britain that rings true in spite of its aberrence; and gets good performances out of his cast, especially Paddy Considine as the brother of one of the girls, who could certainly have used more screen - time, though his co-stars Nathalie Press and Emily Blunt are also good. In reference to Tamsin and Mona's emotional and sexual adventure though, director Pawlikowsky drops numerous flagrant hints as to the direction that the relationship will take. Something about the timelessness, the heaviness of the heat, the bird song and buzzing insects caught perfectly that summer after' A' levels where there is nothing to do but simply live, spend time with friends, and fantasies can take on a larger and more defined shape than realities."
7920,"If the twists, turns, anger, love and incredible, mind - bending insider views weren't already enough, every single episode added had an incredible emotional charge to them. Meaning, all that is revealed (until the very last minutes of the last episode) will make you understand why Michael Peterson had the opportunity to be presented the way he is in this documentary. No matter how you * personally * welcome what the director presents you, the raw honesty and the human emotions will affect you - from everyone involved in this tragedy. Yes, this is a tragic story and has some interesting twists. Possible spoilers ahead--best read once you know a thing or two about the case and the players."
5741,"The fresh POV is that the young Glaswegian Muslim / Catholic couple is not naive teenagers experiencing love for the first time, conflating The Other with sexual discovery, but experienced 20 - somethings who know perfectly well about the vagaries of relationships. The gender switch provides an interesting dynamic that effectively shows how ethnic and racial tensions add to the simple interactions or the usual up and down strains that any new relationship goes through. Eva Birthistle is certainly the standout, but it would be unfair to name any other actor before the others. ; just a kind of "" yeah, that's right, these people and these feelings are real ""."
5742,"Michael Nyqvist is truly genius, with his crazy unique look and Frida Hallberg is charming and approachable. A beautiful film, touching profoundly up the simple, yet divine aspects of humanity. Back to the roots with "" like it is in heaven "" - what are the real values of life? But the movie is beautiful, set in rural Norrland, the music is absolutely amazing and the characters are lovable. Hearfelt thanks to Kay Pollak and the wonderful cast for this superb treat!"
5768,"When a sports magazine gets bought out, Dave Foreman, an ad sales executive (Dennis Quaid) finds himself playing second - in - command to Carter Duryea (Topher Grace), a hotshot barely half his age. Philip Baker Hall, David Paymer and Marg Helgenberger are all fine in supporting roles and the great Malcom MacDowell is terrific in a brief cameo as a corporate big wig similar to Warren Buffett. Months later a chance meeting between Alex and the recently divorced Carter gives rise to a friendship / romance between the two that causes Carter to question his life and envy the family life Dan has been able to create and maintain over the years. Dennis Quaid and Scarlett Johansson are very good, but Topher Grace is the body slam surprise performance here. He loves his wife, Ann (Marg Helgenbergen) and gets on well with his two teenage daughters."
5743,"The turf of other football firms, and the local pubs are where many of the scenes are shot, but despite following the violence of football hooligans, this film is a lot deeper than that. Predictably, the result is a mess, but flashes of good film - making keep the viewer interested for the 1 hour and 20 minutes or so of football 'n' fights. Tommy and Rod are the central duo, the thugs with brains, imagination, and perhaps the insight that will lift them out of this life. This film is a fairly accurate reflection on the type and mix of people who became hooligans in the first place, especially poignant is the guy who got away from it all, made something half decent of himself and puts it down to simply growing up. As in almost all English movies the acting's great."
5744,"In most Hollywood productions there is only one perspective, the winners view. And then there are the battle scenes which are wonderful and frightening and seem to be the total chaos that war really is. In 1950's Seoul, Jin - Seok (Won Bin) and his older brother Jin - Tae (Jang Dong - gun) are enjoying a strong family life of perfect happiness. TAEGUKGI is his first film since SHIRI, and he's definitely playing the Hollywood game again - tackling Spielberg head on this time."
5745,"Blalock is ambitious, and in fact so focused on his professional and medical goals that sometimes he's clueless as to what others are going through to get him what he wants. It is very much a surprise how the lives of these two men - Blalock and Thomas could have been overlooked for so long. There are a few moments when his southern accent slips and a little British comes through, but in terms of portrayal of the character, he is convincing. You see it in his eyes, in his pauses, in his voice. One thing the movie communicates very effectively is just how much of a revolution this surgery was: not merely operating on a baby heart, Dr. Blalock opened the gate to surgery on * any * human heart."
5746,"Hetfield's re-emergence from re-hab is when the film really gets into gear. "" Cunning Stunts "" was an intense concert movie that let you feel the energy of a Metallica gig, where even songs from "" Load "" and "" ReLoad "" sounded good. The emotions of the band members and those around them seem so genuine, though, that it's hard to have any doubts about the movie's authenticity. Hetfield, Hammett and Ulrich try to be honest throughout the whole documentary and everybody comes across as a more or less normal person (Ulrich and his ego are more than just a bit annoying, though, and it's sad to see that the band still doesn't seem to have the tiniest bit of respect for their former bandmate Jason Newstedt, who had to put up with a lot of crap for almost 15 years). Being the most famous and popular of heavy metal bands, with 90 million albums sold over the past 20 years, Metallica has not exactly gone unchronicled, uninterviewed, or unfilmed."
5747,"Instead, the film starts off with the nice Tookie Williams who has kind eyes and a nature that evokes sympathy. STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits A true story depicting the story of Crips founder Stanley' Tookie' Williams, played by Jamie Foxx. A movie about his life was therefore a perfect opportunity to inform both sides of the armchair debaters, showing why Tookie was put in prison and sketching the events leading to his self - claimed redemption. Impressed by the intelligent and seemingly remorseful man she now sees in front of her, she is astonished when he asks for her help - in writing children's books warning of the dangers of gang life! Jamie Foxx, up to this point an underrated actor, displays amazing range in his portrayal of Williams."
8167,"The Animation, while not up to the caliber of Mulan, is still fairly good. The only good thing in this is that the two trios are endearing, if show - stealers, but not by much. The same sort of fun, silly jokes as Mulan. These two things and the fact that Ming Na actually came back for the role of voicing Mulan are completely overcast by the many issues held in this film. The first Mulan was refreshing, since it had clear feminist themes and a vastly understated romantic connect without having to re-imagine the characters from the original material, as Disney has done prior in the '90s."
5749,"In India, red light districts are booming in cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Calcutta where millions of transient men live and work far away from their homes and wives. The others: Gour, Puja, Tapasi, and Suchitra all show a unique ability to find beauty in their ugly environment. The film itself is technically beautiful, with a melange of colors, sounds, and activity, centered on the children but also including others. Enter Ms. Briski with cameras in tow. Ms. Briski is an established photographer and now first time director who began in 1997 to explore the lives of sex workers in Calcutta's red - light district, Sonagachi, where over 7000 women and (disgustingly sadly) girls are prostitutes."
5750,"What makes it special is the examination of the complex contrasting personalities and the ironies of success and failure. The Warhols acknowledge their debt to Newcombe's creativity and don't even put themselves in the same exalted sphere of greatness â€“ but the Warhols have something that BJM don't â€“ the ability to integrate their talents with common sense, the real world, and their market â€“ as a mixing pot of talent (even if much of it is distilled from guru Newcombe) and accessibility, they are the very definition of' cool . ' The downside is that it is still a documentary, however intimate, and it will mostly only appeal to dedicated film fans or people who are already interested in the music of one or both of the featured bands. While the Dandy Warhols went on the reach commercial success, BJM still was stuck in the underground scene; and for good reason why. He is a very talented musician, its amazing how many instruments he can play and with such skill."
5751,"Give thanks to the genius of Stacey Peralta (Dogtown & Z - boys) and his uncanny ability to brilliantly capture the life & death drama that is part of big wave riding. Stacy Peralta has followed up Dogtown and Z - Boys with an equally stunning documentary about the history of the big - wave surfing culture in America. The big wave surfers gradually progressed to bigger and better waves around the Hawaiian coast, where most of the surfing community was concentrated until the discovery of The Mavericks, a dangerous but glorious surfing mecca in Northern California. Perfectly complementing the almost mythic personalities are the ridiculously massive and powerful waves themselves. Hamilton is all the more appealing for his apparent humility--he repeatedly insists that his acclaim also belongs to his teammates / companions, who tow him by jet - ski into waves no mortal could catch with the traditional' paddle - in' method and then sweep in to pick him up before he gets caught in the wave wash of the next big one--embodying the free - spirited,' because it's there' attitude shared by most elite high - risk athletes and the true ethos of hardcore surfers, who live for the ride and see the trappings of the culture (parties, chicks, sponsorship, etc.) as incidental if not entirely unimportant."
5814,"To see him speaking and to hear others reminisce about him added a very nice personal touch. Having had aspirations to do opera and having a very, very high - pitched voice (almost like one of the castrati), his singing was something unmatched then or today. How the story was told was done well, though there were limits since the video recordings of Nomi were often of poor quality due to the technology of the time. Weird, but considering Nomi's legacy, probably appropriate. This is a remarkable compilation of interviews, live shows, home videos, and more all bringing together the short but phenomenal career of Klaus Nomi."
4930,"There is one very memorable kiss which takes place at a party, while David Gray's "" This Years Love "" plays in the background. THE GIRL NEXT DOOR, Luke Greenfield's sexy yet sweet teen angst flick, owes a lot to both the RISKY BUSINESS premise (HS Senior, his goal a prestigious college, has his life turned' upside - down' by world-wise' Pro'), and the internal structure of John Hughes' 80's teen' classics' (geeky hero, and his two geekier friends, gain acceptance and prestige through his relationship with a' dream girl'). Close your eyes, and you could easily picture the young Anthony Michael Hall or John Cusack filling Emile Hirsch's role, with Rebecca De Mornay or Kelly Preston replacing Elisha Cuthbert as his ex-porn star girlfriend. THE GIRL NEXT DOOR, however, actually works quite well, thanks to Greenfield's' tongue - in - cheek' approach to the naughtiness, and a flawless supporting cast, particularly Timothy Olyphant as a likable but ultimately ruthless porn producer, and Timothy Bottoms and Donna Bullock, as Hirsch's clueless but blindly supportive parents. Emile Hirsch shows a propensity towards' soulfully earnest' expressions, but does provide one of the film's funniest scenes, as, while high on Ecstasy, he attempts to navigate through a crowd awaiting his speech on' high moral fiber'."
5753,"What comes out as obvious is the fact that, as a person puts it, this form of control is even more vicious than authoritarian governments: leaving the people "" free "" of believing that they are indeed free and well informed is a machiavelic way of control. The movie itself is well made, even though the first 20 minutes or so have a bit of sloppy editing. Through hundreds of hours of research, Greenwald assembled a good array of clips to prove his point that Fox is anything but fair and balanced. Not counting O'Reilly here (because no one can take that guy seriously anyway), the rest of the FOX "" News "" staff seems to give quite a good impression. This film is so hilarious sometimes that one can only wonder if ANYONE with an IQ over 80 can take this O'Reilly guy seriously."
5755,"Dark, edgy, subtle and at times emotionally devastating, MILLION DOLLAR BABY represents the apotheosis of Eastwood's art - the most lucid and intelligently limned expression of his philosophy of the outsider, the noble loners whose personal codes of honour set them both above and apart from the compromised, corrupt societies they inhabit. Co-stars Hilary Swank and the magnificent Morgan Freeman, playing Frankie's unlikely protegee Maggie Fitzgerald and friend "" Scrap - Iron "" Dupris, give what are without question the best performances of their respective careers: deftly underplayed, their roles provide emotionally overwhelming impacts more powerful than anything glimpsed in the film's riotous fight sequences. In MILLION DOLLAR BABY, though, Eastwood the director brings a fresh eye and an entirely fresh approach to both the setting and characterisations, virtually re-inventing this venerable sub-genre rather than simply recycling its conventions. "" An old master's new masterpiece, "" the NEW YORK TIMES said in a review that was more of an open love letter to Eastwood than anything remotely resembling a critical analysis of the film itself. Forming an iron triangle forged from mutual dependence, Dunn and Dupris school the impulsive but untutored Maggie in both the techniques of boxing and the tradecraft of survival in a world pre-disposed to pulverise individualism."
6507,"The amount of detail put into such a short amount of time certainly makes the film worthy of all the awards it has received at various festivals. Oh yeah - he also likes to sketch the female shoppers (at least the prettier ones) in the nude. This short is available on a compilation DVD containing eight of ten nominees for the two Academy Awards Shorts categories (two of the Animated Short nominees aren't included) and it's a very good DVD indeed. A completely refreshing short movie that is able to combine many different emotions in 20 minutes! However, the imagination and the simple fact that so many ideas are crammed into the fifteen or so minutes of this short really make this film incredible."
5759,"The acting was flawless - Don Cheadle's breathtaking performance being a particular standout - and the direction didn't falter, despite all the potential pitfalls of dramatising a recent and horrific conflict. For years, he's turned in one superb performance after another. He gets great support from Sophie Okonedo as Paul's Tutsi wife, Tatiana, and Nick Nolte doing his best work in years as a Canadian United Nations officer, Colonel Oliver. It's based on a true event, about Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu who worked at four star hotel in Kigali. It focuses on the true - life story of Paul Rusesabagina and his amazing, heroic struggle."
4924,"To really enjoy it, one would have to alter their expectations to what director Todd Phillips has chosen to deliver instead--a clever film that is both an absurdist spoof and a respectful, faithful homage at the same time. However, if you're a fan of gritty 1970s films as well as a fan of Stiller and Wilson's usual material, you should find much to love here. Phillips has remarkably captured the look and feel of a typical 1970s film. The costumes, hairstyles, and overall production design are also perfect for a subtle spoof on the 1970s, and given the source material, even the plot has the slightly formulaic, slightly hokey, almost made - for - television feel that is appropriate for this genre. Other outstanding supporting roles are played by Vince Vaughn, Snoop Dogg, Will Ferrell and Juliette Lewis, all except Dogg slightly out of character, but just as enjoyable and funny as always, as they're all somewhat faithfully filling traditional 1970s roles."
4923,"The photography and the landscapes are just astonishing; and the work of Mortensen is so remarkable. Hidalgo is so famous that a sheik has sent a servant to invite him to participate in a race across the Arabian desert, which he accepts, it being a better alternative to the humiliating performances. It's really a classical adventure movie, with princesses and scimitars and sandstorms and swarms of locusts. Viggo Mortensen plays the lead character, Frank T. Hopkins, with aplomb, humor, humility, and spunk. Viggo Mortensen's portrayal of a gentle, laid - back cowboy hearkens back to the golden age of cinema and would make the likes of Gary Cooper proud!"
5762,"This movie is a treat in this day and age of "" talkie "" movies with too much exposition and dialog. This new movie, "" 3 - Iron "", shows the best of ki - Duk's soul and senses. Korea must be an interesting place to make movies. Like in all the ki - Duk movies, the violence is an essential element, that can't appear hidden, because in this time, the violence is the gun of the characters. The lead actor Hee Jae really performs one of the most memorable performances, with hardly saying a word, his arching brows or glare in his face conveys every emotion masterfully compared to other actors who would have to say a million lines."
5763,"It's a visually beautiful film with loads of odd little CG touches and subtle visual gags. The soundtrack was quirky and wonderful with unexpectedly hilarious Bowie covers and pounding, rocking tracks in the action scenes. Wes Anderson has excellent cinematography, with some great CGI, depicting marine life in a very retro fashion, and beautiful landscapes, as well as a very well put - together soundtrack including Sigur Ros, The Stooges and Ziggy Stardust era Bowie played in Portuguese with a classical guitar accompaniment. The script is also very well written and the story is so well put - together that even an attack by pirates or looting a large scientific institution seem plausible in a serious movie about an oceanographer! That automatically means it's a good vehicle for Bill Murray, who excels at wacky characters, event he low - key ones as he sometimes plays (i. e. Lost In Translation, The Royal Tenebaums, etc.)."
5764,"The direction, editing and cinematography are all the first - rate work by individuals who are clearly masters of their profession and the production design, costumes and makeup are the best you'll see all year. Despite the criticism of the hardcore DiCaprio - haters, the unprejudiced will observe an excellent performance that takes genuine risks and convincingly conveys the passing of more than twenty years. Importantly, DiCaprio more than holds his own when paired with Cate Blanchett and especially Alan Alda, who both give equally note worthy performances. Blanchett's interpretation of Katherine Hepburn seems spot on, and anyone familiar with the late actresses mannerisms will appreciate the hard work that clearly went into the recreation. Without wanting to sound like a film student, movies should, ultimately, be ABOUT something; love, honor, courage, redemption, the BIG ideas and themes that are the fuel of the plot."
5765,"It is a visually stunning movie - the costuming and sets are as extravagant and lavish as the music. As for Rossum she makes a good Christine. Something about the way Mr. Butler played him, was so sexy and he drew the WOMEN to him. The theatre set itself was absolutely stunning; marble and velvet being the main materials within it. Emmy Rossum (Christine) was 17 when this was filmed and was absolutely outstanding."
5766,""" Ms. Ross's insistence at the age of thirty nine of playing Dorothy age twelve in' The Wiz', "" wrote Ms. Kael, "" amounts to a whim of iron . "" Spacey's strong ties to his own mother have been reported and Bobby Darin's relationship with his mother is at the focal point of the story, as well as Sandra Dee's, Darin's wife. Owing some stylish influence to Fosse's "" All That Jazz "" and even Coppola's "" One From the Heart "", "" Beyond the Sea "" shows off Spacey's strong grasp of cinematic story telling moving between surrealism and reality, and his even stronger vocalizing ability in sounding about as close to Darin as you could expect. She comes across as a very positive and nice person, a lot more than Darin whose problems are shown as well as his good points. Without actually imitating Darin, he manages to capture Darin's charisma and stage presence and well as his singing characteristics and mannerisms."
5767,"It was quite a popular film at the festival, especially with all the Oscars - buzz surrounding Kevin Bacon due to this film. It's not an easy film to watch, but the performances are all good, the story's riveting and it's definitely one of the best, most thought - provoking films of the year. Bacon's mesmerizing performance is enhanced by astute direction from first - timer Nicole Kassell, who also adapted the screenplay with the original playwright, Steven Fechter. The Woodsman is about a pedophile who gets released from prison and tries to fit into society. He really lifts this film a couple of notches as well."
5769,"Aside from the humor, this is the crux of Meet the Fockers. Made after the success of Meet the Parents, Meet the Fockers carries on where the last film left off, with Greg delivering babies while his stuffy future father in laws delivers ultimatums, both with memorable results. The film also included some wildly funny moments, such as the teenager born out of wedlock to Greg's babysitter, a young lad with humongous eyebrows who was a dead - ringer for Ben Stiller's character and Jack's outrageous motor home rigged with listening devices, which provided him with his command center for spying on the Fockers. A paternity case, a busload of buxom cheerleaders who start to remove their tops and an incident of mooning are also played for laughs. After convincing his fiancÃ©e's parents to allow them to marry, Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) now has to deal with what happens when her ex-CIA father Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro) meets his own wacky ex-hippy parents, played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand."
5770,"Penn deserves another award, Noami Watts and Don Cheadle are also excellent, and Michael Wincott, as Penn's brother, makes his one scene memorable. The theater in Toronto was over a thousand seats and was packed. Sean Penn is Sean Penn--just the best that there is and this is as great as anything he has ever done. It was a packed house and Sean Penn, Neil Mueller, and Alfonso Cuaron were there to talk afterwards. The performances here are just as compelling and the 70s look of the film is absolutely perfect."
5771,"She should be fun to watch for years to come. If you want to be captivated and moved with a few laughs in between, go see this movie. Gabel's distillation of Capps' novel is in the atmosphere she creates with these gifted actors. The DVD contains some excellent deleted scenes and one of the more informative' making of' segments with Gabel, Travolta, Johansson, Macht, and Rhodes speaking with quiet eloquence. There is a captured ambiance of the South complete with decay, shanties, intermittent rain, and aimless broken lives that sets a fine stage for a rather minimal story."
5772,' The Merchant of Venice' is one of Shakespeare's better - known plays and is still regularly performed in the theatre. This is one of the best Shakespeare adaptations of recent years; an intelligent and visually attractive look at a complex play.
5773,"Nakashima Tetsuya's wonderful "" Shimotsuma Monogatari "" (Shimotsuma Story) is quite a unique and charming film. Mixing anime, quirky narrative, inventive storytelling, outrageous comedy and Japanese Pop Culture charm this movie is a really endearing movie. Anna Tsuchiya is also a wonderful surprise as Ichiko / Ichigo, the tough talking "" Yanki "" Sukeban with a heart of gold. The surreal, dreamy humor was represented mostly through Momoko. "" Kamikaze Girls "" is the archetypal essence of Manga - Culture come alive, pure J - Pop Fanservice in psychedelic, overbidding videoclip visuals (including one hysterical Anime story sequence), and one of those rare movies, where you don't ever want to see the credits."
5774,"Beside a wonderful dose of nostalgia for boomers, this is a movie packed with humor, solid entertainment, decency, and important lessons about life. Compare this with other kids movies that are chock full of scatological humor and impending sexuality and you will see that Fat Albert stands far and above. It is so satisfying to watch a film for teens and children that is determined to amuse and enlighten without objectionable material. A lot of the scenes in the movie seemed as though they were for occupying space and time more than for aiding the plot. He also liked the idea of someone looking out for the "" lonely "" kid."
5775,"The book, a fantasy world constructed over decades, was over 15, 000 pages long, and completely unique to the unknown inner world of the man. Visually, Yu uses Darger's paintings, animating the figures, and constructs a narrative largely connected with the stories in the book. What has brought Darger so much posthumous attention is his artwork: obsessive drawings of little girls, brightly coloured, on long sheets of butcher's paper. Less commendable is Yu's decision at several points to use new artwork that paraphrases Darger's themes; audiences will mistake these images for actual Darger artwork. Because Yu has no footage of Darger, and only a handful of photographs of him, she resorts to re-enactments."
4921,Not only is Garai beautiful but she can act too as she delivers a sincere performance. There were some great foot - tapping songs and the dances were fairly good too. You want to just stand up and dance (even if you have no idea how to) Havana nights really takes you into the lives of these two people and makes you really care about them. It present the same kind of feelings and emotions as the original Dirty Dancing. Diego Luna does his part well although in a few scenes he does seem to have difficulty with some expressions.
4920,"It's for the teenagers that have to sneak into the movies because they're 17th birthday is in 2 weeks, it's for the general person that wants to laugh and escape bills and the real world. They are two totally different style movies. From Sam the fun police to Jenni (played by the super hot Brittney Daniel) each charecter was histarical. Broken Lizards Club Dread is a extremly funny movie that doesn't deserve to be bashed like it is. Just like Super Troopers, the first big installment from Broken Lizard, this film WILL satisfy those who seek a good time."
5982,"Although little of the action was original (bus stunt again, amongst others) it is much better in this film than any of his recent American financed films. ' New Police Story' shows how top production values, a well - known cast, a fine action director and a great director of photography can turn a pretty moronic screenplay into an entertaining action movie. Jackie's partner is Nicholas Tse, who did a lot of his own stunts in this movie. In many scenes you can see his tears (and no one in the theater was laughing). This is a breath of fresh air from his last few big duds."
5784,"Like the characters in that earlier film, the Travises seem, on the surface, to be the ideal suburban family, until, one fateful day, their oldest son, Matt, who is the "" golden boy "" athlete and, thus, the apple of his father's eye, kills himself with no explanation (one minor difference is that the son in "" Ordinary People "" dies as a result of an accident, not a suicide). His wife, Sandy, is the most complex character in the film, a free - spirited child of the' 60's who feels oddly adrift in the role of mother and wife as she endures a basically loveless marriage in sterile suburbia. Hirsch plays out the character quite well, revealing frame after frame in the visual expression of his body, a host of conflicting emotions inside the soul of a kid whom no one seems to listen to or know very well, unknowing and unaware of his depth of soul and prodigious talent. This film is chock - full of little surprises, many of them funny."
5788,"The man deserves countless praises, not only for playing Sellers himself to perfection, but also for flawlessly re-creating pretty much every film and radio role Sellers ever played, from Dr. Strangelove to Chance the gardener to Clouseau himself. Despite the fact that virtually the whole show centers around Rush and his masterful performance, he is backed up by a strong supporting cast and crew. And it's nice to see some higher profile actors taking the back seat here, such as Charlize Theron, delightfully ditzy and yet not quite a parody as Sellers' airheaded second wife Britt Eckland. And John Lithgow is an excellent Blake Edwards, blending his eternal optimism and energy with a sense of self pride, which he is forced to swallow, asking Sellers to return for numerous Pink Panther sequels. Perhaps it's because' The Life and Death of Peter Sellers' feels more like a series of snapshots, and not like a proper biography."
5789,"Other aspects are fairly well done; the music is done fairly well, with the opening song giving it a distinct flavour but later that fades away to the average run - of - the - mill songs that aren't particularly effective in rousing the emotions and senses. It's storyline is not so complex you need to scratch your head, like other anime (Akira or Final Fantasy), and the animation is a feast to the eyes. The 3D style looks better in motion than in screen shots, validating its place in Anime's future (for characters, Ghost in the Shell already displayed the awesome extent to which environments can benefit). As a whole product, it's graphical presentation rivals that of great 2D animation features. The range of emotions expressed through the CG is impressive; and motion capture has worked beautifully into the film, making it a seamless viewing experience."
4919,"GOOD - Kudos for someone finally presenting an accurate account of Christ's sufferings, as gruesome and horrible as they were, although, if you read the Gospel accounts in the Bible, it was even worse than shown on this film. It is true that the Jews were involved in the crucifixion of Christ, just as it's said in the bible for nearly two thousand years. The scenes are so believable, the violence so real, that the scenes appear to take place in your very presence; imagine before you a man being torn to bloody shreds; your helpless to do anything, you're a spectator - utterly horrific. However, the overall effect is that there isn't anything sanitized in this film; it's an according - to - the - Book account and after you see this on film, it shakes you up. As an historical observation, the film is brilliant, depicting the social and political dynamics of the Romans and Sanhedrin with clarity and accessibility."
4918,"Nice change of scenery for Kristin Kreuk even though she just appears briefly. Scott Mechlowicz continues the good performance he had set in Mean Creek, not to be compared of course, but good performances in both. Although this may not be great art, or even great comedy, "" Eurotrip "" is a terribly crude, but awfully funny movie. With a strong cast, plenty of well written gags and an overall cheesy script - EuroTrip is definitely a winner. Yes it's crude and yes it doesn't show anything about how Europe really is, but it's also incredibly funny."
6451,"Part documentary, part essay, part brilliantly edited collage, Curtis tracks the rise and rise of two groups: the American neo-cons and the radical Islamists. In the next decades some of his followers like Paul Wolfowitz, John Ashcroft or William Kristol set about putting his ideas into practice, first during the cold war and now during the Bush - era. What makes this documentary so outstanding is not just that it clearly exposes many of the myths of the so - called "" War on Terror, "" but the fact that it places the power of these myths in a larger and very important context. One can only hope that a discerning public will eventually be exposed to the hollow, vain, and arrogant "" men behind the curtain "" in both societies, so that all can realize that these wizards of terror are just empty charlatans. This is a superb 3 - part BBC documentary about how gov' ts overblow threats to create "" nightmares "" which can then be used for domestic purposes / control."
5798,"It's a very funny, sexy, artistic and young (but still mature) movie, that perfectly shows the process of discovery of sexuality, with all the good and bad aspects of it. It portraits gay and straight boys and girls naturally, just as they are and the interesting (and incredibly funny) interaction between them. Robert Stadlober is in great shape acting, as well as the whole of the cast. The bittersweet movie features a stellar performance by its lead Robert Stadlober as Tobi and explores his road to self - discovery and identity through his long - standing secret admiration and love for his best pal, Achim. The dilemma that Tobi faced in trying to come to terms with his own sexuality is well - handled by Stadlober."
5799,"Direction, camera and acting are of an unparalleled level and make you, as the viewer, feel as if you are actually in Berlin, 1945, and in the FÃƒ 1/4 hrer's bunker. The director, Oliver Hirshbiegel, working with a big cast, brings to life the madness of the last days of the monster, as observed by a young and impressionable secretary who witnessed most of the crisis. The film captures the tragic figure of Hitler as everything is caving in on him and his grand plans for victory. Mr. Ganz's uncanny resemblance with Hitler is what makes the film works the way it does. As Traudl Junge, the young secretary, Alexandra Maria Lara gives a subtle performance."
4917,"A highlight of the film is Lohans rendition of' That Girl' which takes part at the end of the High School show. Glenne Headly, as Lola's mother Karen, is responsible for moving her budding teenage actress daughter Lola from the trendy, exciting New York City to Dellwood, New Jersey. The film is made watchable by Lindsay Lohan only; she also sings several songs, including the title track. No offense to Duff, but Lohan is a much better actress and has proved that in films with scripts so much more intelligent than this one. All of her emotions are exhibited through annoyingly literal musical cues (HAPPY songs mean that she is HAPPY and vice versa) Her friend (played by Alison Pill) comes from the Disney stable of rent - a-kids."
4916,"The casting is frankly excellent, a sympathetic though selfish Meg Ryan, a two - fisted but sensible Omar Epps, today well known as the doctor in Â¨ House Â¨, such as Tony Shaloub by Â¨ Monk Â¨ series; furthermore Jose Cortese and Tim Daly (son of James Daly and brother of Tyne Daly) as a sports reporter. You can't hate a story when it comes from true events and both Shaloub and Ryan pull off their characters with finesse. Omar Epps fares a bit better, turning in a performance of strength and dignity, though the script lets him down by failing to develop his character to any appreciable extent. In this world, good always triumphs over evil and people always get their dreams. Tony Shaloub is the best here, as the ruthless local boxing manager and promoter who gets his cronies to blacklist her and prevent her boxer from fighting in local fights."
4949,"However, don't expect a sugary sweet fairy tale story: while it is sweet, the story has many modern twists and plenty of humour thrown in for good measure (Scotty the roommate and Soren the butler / caretaker are, quite simply, hilarious). And of course, Paige teaches Eddie about love and work ethic, while Eddie teaches Paige about poetry and the pains and pleasures of wealth and privilege. The scenes shot in Denmark were splendid and added an aura of magic to the main love relationship. The physical casting of the two leads is very good."
4908,"All of the main characters are just a treat to watch, especially if you get the DVD. The extras are very nice and complimentary. Gene Hackman played the best character, a popular ex-President who moves to his vacation home only to find himself running for mayor. He is moving to the small Maine town of Mooseport, and some of the citizens persuade him to run for mayor. Maura Tierney, so very good on the television show News Radio, doesn't have anything to do."
4907,"Rating 8/10 one of the funniest movies of the year and a must see if you want a good comedy. Sandler is great in this film and he is one of the funniest comedians around today. There are more laughs in this than in another, perhaps more pretentious picture, "" Punch Drunk Love "". Rob Schneider has a small role in this film but he still manages to draw some laughs. Chances are very good that you will enjoy it."
5805,"James McAvoy is perfect as Rory O'Shea, who has Duchene's muscular dystrophy. Damien O'Donnell and Jeffrey Caine have put together a great movie which will appeal to all ages. Romola Garai is amazingly gorgeous and brilliant in her role. His "" Rory "" takes hold of a condescending home for "" special people "" the way Jack Nicholson shook up the mental ward in "" One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest . "" Michael (played by Steven Robertson) has cerebal palsy, and lives a quiet, and dull, life in Carrigmore Residential Home."
5806,"Particularly, the eyes of the eldest boy, Akira, are very impressive. As Akira steps up and takes charge of the apartment, the bills, and his siblings, the children still hold hope that mother will be home soon. Koreeda's direction of the children is exceptional, as if the film was shot entirely candid. Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Nobody Knows is the performances of the four children. After you see the film, it is likely that Koreeda preferred it this way, tapping into the honesty and energy that such youth had to offer."
5807,"Highly recommended, if not at the cinema it will make a great Sunday night in on DVD! Mr. Rouse is a man that has worked extensively on television, as well as his co-screen writer, Jay Leggett, who also has a minor role in the film. Christina Applegate and Andrea Bendewald are also good as the duplicitous women who seem to have figured out their men and what make them tick. Forget the expectations and just have a good time. Parts are mildly amusing, but there's more suspense and drama than anything else."
5813,"Howl is an interesting departure from Miyazaki's more classical wabi - sabi anime style that most of his heroes and heroines are drawn in as Howl is definitely a very contemporary bishonen. If you're looking for quaint settings, dynamic characters and a very involving character or plot driven story, you're not going to necessarily find them here, but you will find an equally stunning and pleasing movie if you let yourself go and enjoy this passionate, heartfelt and surreal Miyazaki dream. The castle is itself is a mesh - mash of so many haphazardly arranged pieces that an engineer would have an aneurysm just sorting them all out and yet it works. are great variations of one's he's used before and there are some rather dark and beautiful scenes of a world at war. He's the heart of the castle and only annoyed at his first few scenes then becomes a very likable character."
4900,"A documentary with the DVD shows the great lengths they went to in filming this in order make the action look realistic. While the film suffers from a lack of depth in the portrayal of the players (by the way, they do all their own skating; TV footage is not used), MIRACLE's' feel' of the decade is well - done, using montages and voice - overs to convey the American sense of helplessness in a decade of tragedies. The good stuff was out in front: the realistic hockey scenes and the inspiring true - life story of an amazing underdog sports team pulling off the "" miracle . "" According to the film, Brooks is relatively new to these techniques which he adopted while studying USSR hockey. The hockey itself wasn't actually that bad as some scenes of the game were pretty cool."
5817,"The scene moves between Amritsar and Goa to London and Beverley Hills, all in brighter - than - bright super-saturated colour, with an assortment of equally colourful characters, wonderful costumes, lavish dance pieces and heavenly bollywood - style ballads. While almost everything is in English (except for a few subtitled songs), nearly all the characters are top Indian performers. In the golden age of musicals, stars such as Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire had a whole sub-industry to draw on for good dancers who could also sing and act well, plus the technicians used to producing high - end musicals. The sets and dialogue give authentic, if stereotypical, glimpses of Indian life and values. Like many east - meets - west movies, the stereotypes are a handle to allow easy assimilation of foreign ideas, and the heavy Indian involvement wards off any tendency to patronise (which is one of the themes explored in the film)."
4898,"The good thing about this movie, is to show how S. A. T is terrible and how it scares the students. Many important things, like the students grades in school, are not taken care of. To the detailed observer you may even find a few ironic twists and laughs throughout the movie Some almost assuredly intended and some only fate could have delivered. One of the best aspects the director and writer brought to this was to poke fun at some of the Aspects that will remind you of other films and popular teen television shows. Their grades may be good, but without a good score on this one test makes the difference in what college they can get into."
4897,"It's also another good example of a PG - 13 movie that should have been rated "" R. "" There are tons of examples of that in the last 15 years. The Big Bounce looked set to become another laugh - free, empty, crude comedy, with lots of sexual humor and an overload of women in bikinis; a type of movie that people seem to want to make these days (although it has to be said that these days this kind of movie is sadly quite successful). Actually, it's a vacuously enjoyable, if occasionally rather desperate comedy with some nice, sun - bleached photography, and a few funny scenes. First of all helmer George Armitage also directed the fabulous and completely hysterical black comedy Grosse Pointe Blank with John Cusack; it has Owen Wilson, one of the better young comedians, who proved himself in films such as The Royal Tenenbaums and Shanghai Noon (in which he was by far the funniest thing); there is also the reassuring presence of Morgan Freeman, a man who usually elevates films from bad to mediocre. See the scenes with Charlie Sheen too - and there's a bouncing something there they keep between them."
5915,"The gorgeous Leonor "" Cleopatra "" Varela also shows she is much more than a pretty face, putting in a very moving performance as Chava's mother. First time actor Carlos Padilla portrays Chava in the film, and his outstanding performance is a credit as much to director Luis Mandoki as it is to himself. Both the director (Luis Mandoki) and the screenplay writer (Oscar Torres, who was the boy in the film) were present for an emotional and uplifting Q&A. The characters are well written; the plot well told and the actors, especially, the kid playing Chava are very good. The rest of the cast is also routinely superb, including Spaniard Daniel GimÃ©nez Cacho as the priest and Jesus Ochoa (uncredited on IMDb) as the bus driver."
4976,It is very telling that Hector seems to doubt the gods he has been taught to worship.
5197,"This movie is worth the money and worth your time if you are a Shrek fan or a Eddie Murphy fan this movie if for you. Though more clearly made for adult audiences than the original, Shrek 2 is still warm - hearted family fare. The gang at Dreamworks was smart enough not to monkey around with a winning formula, so you have all the wit and charm of Shrek (Mike Myers), Fiona (Cameron Diaz), Donkey (Eddie Murphy), and all the fantastic fairy - tale creatures. Shrek 2 has as much humor, talent, and fun as the original classic, and almost as much heart. Naturally the anti-social Shrek wants nothing to do with the invitation, but gives in to Fiona and Donkey's insistence."
5198,"All this film does is to provide spectacle and moments of dramatic action â€“ if you want to think about it then you will only hurt your enjoyment of the action. In that regard the film carries all the usual problems that the genre carries but happily benefits from the fact that the effects are much better than 1970's movies could manage. So on that level, it works; the music by Harald Kloser and Thomas Wanker is also a bonus, being more restrained and serious in its support than is usually the way with Emmerich movies. How convenient that right after Jack Hall discovers the plate breaking away in Antarctica and right as he presents this to the "" Global Warming Conference, "" all his predictions begin to come true! The clichÃ©s are all present and correct: the politicians, the upright scientists, the sacrifice, the daring rescues and so on."
5199,"Heck, there's even a hunky, hockey - playing Lutheran minister on hand - the kind one can only find in movies - to provide spiritual as well as romantic comfort for those times when the going gets to be just a bit too tough for the harried guardian. Helen loved staying out late and going to nightclubs, but she now has to take care of the children. Sakina Jaffrey plays the funny Indian neighbour quite well. "" Raising Helen "" is a formulaic romantic comedy that makes you wonder when Kate Hudson will again find a role that will actually allow her to stretch herself as an actress, fulfilling the promise she made half a decade ago in "" Almost Famous . "" Under the sure hand of Garry Marshall it makes for a pleasant time at the movies."
5200,"But it has enough laughs to be worth looking at. This movie hit those stereotypes in such an amusing way. Kevin Hart, Tom Arnold, Snoop Dog, K. D. Cubert, the funny Mo' nique, and the beautiful Sofia Vergara make this a movie with a lot of laughs. The director has gathered a lot of talented black entertainers in a comedy that is best watched with a lot of friends because there are some hysterical moments in it that are a riot."
5824,"The cinematography is excellent: the camera - work is superb, the mood is perfect, the effects are beautifully rendered (and not overused), and the timing of individual scenes is consistent throughout the piece. The concept of Imperfect Good vs Seductive Evil within the human soul was hardly invented by George Lucas (though vampires in Star Wars would be pretty freakin' cool), and its presentation in Night Watch is tight and interesting. The soundtrack is annoyingly offered for the cell phones: you saw the movie - now set your ringtone to the Night Watch terrific score! The cast was great, acting - almost impeccable and not over the top (what frequently degrades modern Russian fantasy, sci - fi or action movies). Entirely new for the movies with such kind of a pleasant premise is that none has ever got killed, except for a handful of malefactors (like that stoned bloodsucker)."
5202,"The fact is, some people do go to extremes in their religious zeal (anyone familiar with 9/11), and simply depicting such a character in a movie hardly makes it anti-Christian. All others may find it worth the price of the rental. is one of this year's best movies. She finds friends in the most unlikely of persons - outcasts. The acting was excellent all around in the film and there were some hilariously clever moments including one that the entire theatre laughed for about fifteen seconds."
5825,"Sing's actions attracts the notorious Axe Gang, and set off a relentless chain of events that brings the clans together in an explosive battle. Apart from creativity, Kung Fu Hustle has also demonstrated a higher quality comedy than his early 1990s works such as Fight Back to School (1991) and King of Beggars (1992). The cinematography is more sophisticated, with an authentic 1930s aura. Most of them appeared in some of Stephen Chow's movies before but because the context of every movie is different, the overall result is hilarious. It maintains the previous Chow's style and humor as in other movies, such as "" Xi Ju Zhi Wang "" and "" Xing Yun Yi Tiao Long "", while those CGIs were not expected."
5204,"The death scenes are also pretty good even if they are unrealistic. Renny Harlin isn't exactly known for making intelligent movies, but at least they're usually quite enjoyable. Forget the award recognition that everyone likes to talk about around this time of year, MINDHUNTERS is a fast paced, thrill ride stuffed with talented actors (including Val Kilmer, Christian Slater, and Jonny Lee Miller) that could easily put director Renny Harlin back on the map after the catastrophe that was DRIVEN. Although not being exceptional, "" Mindhunters "" is a good thriller and slash movie."
5926,"the edukators is a hugely enjoyable film that perfectly balances the human themes of friendship, love and trust with it's more political undertones. With this basic plot, The Edukators delves into that ill - defined human notion of morality, eventually blurring the line between the ethics of social politics and the ethics of personal relationships. all in all, the edukators is a breath of fresh air that is both satisfying to the head and the heart. They form "" The Edukators, "" a group that warns the rich and disturbs their material comfort with non-violent actions. A very interesting, psychologically well developed film, that starts from the rather simple (the whole of the establishment are' a wunch of bankers', as the British say) and then becomes more complex."
5206,"Kind of LOTR meets Star Wars, with more humour (intentional British spelling by the way). "" Chronicles of Riddick "" is a big budget summer blockbuster film and on that level it succeeds. The action scenes in this film were great! And Thandie Newton was a really good "" baddie ""! Thandie Newton's character had a much better grasp of court politics than her husband and Dame Judith's character wasn't just the stereotypical "" wise mystical being "", she was politically savvy as well."
5207,"As for the product placements, yes, they were a bit much, but at least part of the time they were well integrated. To those smacking the "" dated "" references, it was a relief compared to "" Shrek 2 "" to see them come naturally instead of chock - full and fast - pitched. The humour in the original comic strips were entirely geared at the adult generation, not the kids. The set design, in bright hues, can't decide whether it's in the real world or in a real - life comic strip. Garfield is a 2 - D medium, either on the comics page or on animated cels."
5208,"This movie is a perfect example of what is wrong with the state of movies today. The original was a gem, with excellent acting by Katharine Ross, Paula Prentiss, and Patrick O'Neal. The dialogue was pretty intelligent, the plot twists weren't given away in the first 15 minutes, and the ending was a real shocker. The laughs are cheap and lowbrow, vital plot elements of Ira Levin's novel are missing, and the acting is just plain bad. Ira Levin's cautionary novel, "" The Stepford Wives "", was a fascinating fable of the ultimate male backlash to feminism; in 1975, director Bryan Forbes turned the novel into a chilling variation of "" Invasion of the Body Snatchers "", as innocent wives are substituted by zombie - like robots, their husbands bonding in a smugly evil male cult."
5209,"It's not a fall - out - of - your - chair - in - hysterics funny, it's more of a constant - giggling - over-the-silliness-of-it-all funny. Not a culinary gourmet feast, but darn tasty all the same. In terms of story, this one is tops."
5227,"Living with his vegan girlfriend, Morgan Spurlock decides to try and eat McDonalds for every meal for a month. This film may focus on McDonalds because it is the world leader in fast food which is high in saturated fats but if all you take from this film is pleasure at seeing McDonalds taking a kicking then you are missing the point. Spurlock sends this message in a really entertaining way while also having good digs at McDonalds. He is certainly a lot more interesting than his vegan girlfriend who is one of those overbearing self - righteous types who look down their nose at anything. Indeed, this is what happened to Spurlock, however the magnitude of the health deterioration was astounding."
4974,"Van Helsing is a fast - paced, computer graphics - laden horror / adventure / fantasy film wherein Universal re-imagines its core stable of classic horror characters. As for the character remakes, Van Helsing becomes a slick retro - Matrix - styled macho action hero, part James Bond / 007, part Indiana Jones, part Buffy the Vampire Slayer with a secret Catholic Church order filling in for the Watcher's Council and the Bond "" Q Branch "" combined. The look of the film is lush, with lots of unusual point of view shots, exotic locations and computer - generated environments. Combined with the extravagant visuals and quickly changing, sprawling locations, the result is epic in scope. Director / writer Stephen Sommers, who was also responsible for remaking the image of another classic Universal character in The Mummy (1999) and The Mummy Returns (2001) (probably the reason the Mummy is not present in here), begins Van Helsing in a black and white scene that wonderfully recreates the feel of the James Whale - lensed Frankenstein films, including referencing a number of shots, scenes and characters from those classics."
5246,"As far as fight - scenes go, they are well choreographed and Jackie can luckily still kick ass. Coraci does pull the camera back a few times, down to the ankles maybe, so a few scenes are reasonably well - shot. All the backdrops are gorgeous, and everything has a fun feel about it, this is the kind of movie that is just purely for entertainment, very light very easy but all together a fun ride that you should want to see again. A lot of cameo appearances are in this movie and ad a whole lot to the feel of the movie and all the main actors play their parts very well. The movie is breezy and enjoyable, with some fun fight scenes, although it is completely inconsequential."
4895,"It's a brainless, cutesy little romantic comedy--but that's okay since it doesn't try to be anything deep or uber meaningful. Topher Grace does a good job playing the sort of nerdy - uber romantic - always crushing on cheerleaders but never having one as a girlfriend guy. Nathan Lane and Sean Hayes play Tad's agents and they both give funny performances. Watch this if you like predictable dialogue or just enjoy emotional beatings. Topher Grace is very funny and entertaining as Pete."
5248,"Once every few years, you're presented to a slapstick comedy so hilarious you instantly forget how LOW this form of entertainment actually is. Alan Tudyk, Rip Torn, Christine Taylor and Stephen Root are a great ensemble. Dodgeball also doubles as a spot - the - cameo film, since a whole host of odd celebrities pop up here and there throughout. Although the film remained entertaining, like most comedies it lost a bit of its luster in its second viewing. Despite the campiness and good solid humor, this is still a very formulaic film and it does tend to vaporize after a viewing or two."
5249,"Tom Hanks leads an exceptional cast as Viktor Navorski, a man stranded in JFK airport, not welcome in the U. S. and having no country to come home to. Navorski was kind gentle and wise as acting as their Cyrano. The same thing with the Zeta Jones character: everything she said had to be done with her eyes and tears. Letting go ego, is the greatness that even Amelia found out when she gives up and scarifies something most important in her life to help Navorski. Hanks is in the U. S. for a mysterious reason and that reason becomes the hook in this wonderful picture."
5250,"The best films are those that mirror humanity, whether that be in terms of violence committed by Man / Woman to Man / Woman, love, hate, envy, ambition and the others which make up the full range. Auerbach could easily have tweaked her film to emphasise or exaggerate the sense of internal pain of all three leads, but she happily and smartly eschews still shots of these nomadic characters wallowing in their isolation. In terms of characterisation Auerbach also got things right. Fortunately most reviewers here liked the movie. The photography is absolutely marvellous; it hardly needs anything else."
5251,"This movie makes fun of everyone--black, white, rich, poor, dorks, cool people. To the folks who think this movie is anything but funny, well you are hopeless. The plot is very unreal, something you won't see in the real life, but if you pass over this things you'll see one of the best comedies. Frankie Faison was alright playing the chief and delivered a few clever scenes."
5252,"In one of the most moving scenes in the film, the mother opens up to the daughter and tells her story of youthful love and a fateful choice similar to the one Allie herself must face. The film recreated effectively the world of the 1940s in America, including the parental pressure exerted by the well - to - do family of Allie on whether to allow their daughter to pursue a young man from the other side of the tracks. There have been other great movies to comment on love in recent years (Eternal Sunshine, Lost In Translation jump to mind) but this movie fills a need that those other movies miss: the need for a straight, sweep you off your feet romance. Sure, the core is the "" Romeo and Juilet "" theme, but the way is plays out and the exceptional charisma that the actors bring to the screen make it feel fresh and not entirely predictable. The scenes during the opening credits is absolutely breathtaking."
5253,""" Two Brothers "" is a story about two tigers that are separated at a young stage of their lives, while their parents are killed by people that loved to engage in this type of hunting. By seeing the cute (EXTREMELY cute) tigers harassed on screen, kids will definitely develop a passion for the conservation of wildlife and will develop a general humaneness towards other creatures. There are some very precisely dosed moments, showing the two tigers in perspectives, You would really love to explore. Am rarely moved to comment on what others say here, but Sarah from Canada's mindless and cynical response to TWO BROTHERS can't go unchallenged. Also, it portrays a great performances by the Tigers."
5254,"The re-birth of the musical these past few years, is introducing youth to a quality of art that most were not even aware existed. The makers of this movie had to do a balancing act between biography and entertainment. While some renditions are a little too modernized, any influence his music has on today's youth is a good thing. This movie works on so many levels. Even if De-Lovely is not historically correct, Kevin Kline's performance is outstanding."
4894,"As for the technical feats, The Butterfly Effect is very well done. The writers / directors, Bress and Gruber, may not get everything right, but they have delivered an ambitious and thoughtful film. The final question has to be this: so, can Ashton Kutcher deliver a dramatic performance? He's more of cypher than anything, and a lot of the emotional value comes from the side characters whose lives he effects. Still, he holds his own in plenty of scenes."
5833,"It must be good since so many other directors are using a similar format in upcoming documentaries. To learn more about the making of the movie, check out the Apple computers website, and Gunner Palace website. The experiences of the soldiers themselves, are at times, very intriguing and include some amusing and often endearing raps performed by the soldiers about living in Iraq. That said, the footage is superb, the sense of a grunt's life very well evoked, with individual personalities nicely delineated."
5834,""" Walk on Water "" piles layers of personal, family, religious, cultural, historical, employment, geopolitical, sexual, geographical, guilt and responsibility issues on two men--and still makes it work as the gripping story of two individuals whose lives affect each other. The central character Eyal is the quintessential sabra (Israeli - born native), a craggy, macho Mossad agent unable to discuss his feelings about his ravaged marriage, a child of a Holocaust survivor, fatigued with terrorist attacks and revenge, but in the opening moments efficiently murders a Hamas leader. Lior Ashkenazi captures the screen projecting the relaxed casualness of male camaraderie comfortable from years in the military and then his reactions as he gradually realizes he's been thrust into more complex situations. This is a unique film that has several layers all happening at once. Eyal (Lior Ashkenazi in a terrific performance) is a Mossad agent, returning from Turkey after an efficient and clean assassination of a Terrorist only to find that during his absence his wife, Iris, committed suicide."
5281,"Understand that the facts are the facts, the presentation is Mr. Moore's, and your opinion is your own. Nothing here is new to anyone who has spent any time perusing the alternative or progressive media in the past four years, but the effect is substantial because Moore has finally shown himself to be a true documentarian, and has woven together a coherent picture of the connections between the players and the events from December 2000 to the present. Moore raises several provocative questions such as why did Bush sit for seven minutes in an elementary classroom without reacting? In short Moore is against the invasion of Afghanistan but then spends time telling his audience that because Bush didn't into Afghanistan quick enough and without enough men this allowed Bin Laden to escape."
4973,"Taken for what it is, a pre-teen flick featuring the wealthiest 17 - years olds in type - cast roles ever, the movie is not terrible. A fun story of mayhem and mischief, it is far from the worst movie out this season (have you SEEN "" Van Helsing ""? The twins are divided into the extremely original barbie - wild girl types who decide in the end they truly love each other. Its either cartoon - like movies, which this age thinks are not cool enough for them, or right to sex and violence. The Olsen's produce family friendly movies which are enjoyable for what they are."
5285,"Great chase scenes, crashes, and special effects for the guys. Romance, and a tender love story for the gals. They loved each other from afar, and could not communicate their feelings to each other. The special effects are well done, especially where Spiderman has to save passengers on a speeding train. Toby Maquire has the same natural ability which he possessed in the first film to accurately convey the character of Peter Parker who struggles with his feelings for Mary Jane who becomes frustrated that he can't return her feelings for him, to his fractured friendship with Harry Osborne who harbours a deep grudge against Spiderman to trying to balance his life as superhero, student and employee and struggling with his Aunt May over Uncle Ben's death to finally battling the new villain Oto Octavious played memorably by Alfred Molina and all these story strands thread there way through two hours of pure entertainment."
5286,"It stands by itself but is richer seen in relation to "" Before Sunrise, "" made nine years earlier, of which it is the sequel, and besides that it's richer and subtler than the original. He's supposed to go to the airport in a couple of hours, but his bags are packed and a car is ready, and he and CÃ©line agree to go and talk. She leads him to a cafÃ© called Le Pure. Then they take a boat ride on the Seine; finally they get in the car and wind up at CÃ©line's apartment which turns out to be a lovely enclave where her neighbors are together outside having a party. His work is authentic and personal, but has real range, from the slacker movies through the romantic encounters of Delpy and Hawke and the tight theatrical drama "" Tape "" to the inspired philosophical musings and fresh use of animation of "" Waking Life, "" and Hawke has been involved in four of Linklater's movies."
5287,"The fight scenes between the various groups of people vying for control of Briton are good, visually stunning and intense. While it is true that the Romans enlisted soldiers and units from border tribes like the Sarmatians, they were never posted at the other end of the empire. It was fairly entertaining, with well - staged battle scenes and high production values. The movie King Arthur has it all - a tight, well written story, believable characters, gritty realism, a great musical score by Hans Zimmer, epic battles, and more blood and splatter than you probably really wanted to see. Also Keira Knightley kicked butt in this movie as Guinevere she was believable as a warrior in the battle scenes and a lady during the peaceful times."
5288,"Ferrell (who co-wrote the film) is his usual manic self, unctuous but likable, and Applegate, Paul Rudd, Steve Carell, David Koechner, and Fred Willard do fine work in supporting roles. - vain, narcissistic, none too gifted in the brains department - who has worked for years as the sole news dispenser at a top - rated San Diego station. The only redeeming qualities of the movie are Steven Carell and Jack Black's brief scene with Baxter, the dog. Like most mainstream comedies, the humor in "" Anchorman "" ranges from the mildly funny to the downright hilarious, the latter including a clever "" West Side Story "" parody involving a rumble between rival news teams, and a conversation between a dog and a bear that ends the movie on a ludicrous but knee - slapping high note. The movie is at its best when it is parodying the corny graphics and the tendency to over hype the trivial ("" Panda Watch: Day 46 "") that define modern newscasts - and at its worst when it is indulging in silly, often scatological jokes and slapstick throw away bits."
5289,"Julie, Hannah (Mika Boorem), Farrah (Scout Taylor - Compton) and Yancy (Kallie Flynn Childress) sneak out of the house, avoiding Julie's renovation - mad dad and bribing her slacker brother. A sleasy, overweight old guy surprises Yancy by speaking to her, and as this is the first boy who has ever acknowledged her presence, and he loves eating brownies too, he is definitely her boyfriend for life. you "" However this film had only one true intentionally funny part, when the jerk - for - even - thinking - of - kissing - his - girlfriend high school boyfriend and his new girlfriend are trying to win the dance contest, their slow jerky dance movements were the only bright spot in an otherwise idiotic film. All the actors were very good especially Alexa Vega And Kallie as Yancy the typical loser type girl who managed to find friends at a sleepover. There are a couple of very funny scenes from Steve Carell who plays an over-the-top security guard looking to break up the girl's fun."
5290,"It's a retelling of the old classic fairy tale with the modern day twist but director Mark Rosman, who has really nothing to claim fame to does a terrific job at truly modernizing the story without coming across as stupid or blatantly obvious. She always makes Sam grind her fingers to the bone in between school classes working in the diner. Sam has an online boyfriend whom she's never met, there is a school dance in which he wants to meet her, he turns out to be Mr. Popular, she sneaks out having to be back at the diner for twelve before her stepmother finds out. Rhonda played by Regina King, who has been some great family movies ie: Mighty Joe Young, and Daddy Day Care is perfect as Sam's protector and Fairy Godmother you might say? That's because Hilary Duff is, or was, at least, popular with tweens and teens, and lots of slightly older folks have a tendency to hate commercial or popular stuff just because it's commercial or popular."
5291,"You really need to give credit to director Alex Proyas because it is his magic as a filmmaker that holds this film together. Will Smith managed to pull off a stunning performance as "" Del Spooner "", a Chicago detective that is suspicious of robots and is against technology. Even though during the ending credits it says that the movie was suggested by the books by Isaac Asimov most of the movie seemed to play quite well with Isaac Asimov's ideas about robots. But it is also good fun and, along with Spiderman 2, stands out as one of the best of this years generally disappointing crop of blockbusters. She is obvious in the fact that she likes robots much more than humans, and her dislike of Spooner is amusing."
5292,"Inspired by a woman in his Brooklyn neighborhood who told him her story of swallowing capsules of heroin and boarding a plane for the United States, first - time director Marston has escaped the clichÃ©s of social realist films to offer a riveting human odyssey that transcends simplistic messages of good and evil. The lovely Ms. Moreno, in an Oscar - worthy debut performance, is no cardboard character but a fully developed human being who epitomizes the desperation of people who are willing to do almost anything to better their life. "" Maria Full of Grace "" is a very powerful and real movie about the lack of perspective in the life of teenagers in poor countries. He pays meticulous attention to detail, whether it's Maria's life at home, the prickly work at the flower factory, her unconventional independent spirit, her throat exercises to prepare becoming a mule or the creation and ingestion of the latex pellets. Feeling trapped, she quickly accepts when Franklin (Jhon Alex Toro), a friend she recently met at a dance, offers her a huge sum of money to smuggle drugs into the U. S."
5298,"He doesn't utter one liners shortly before or after blowing someone away, nor does he spend most of the movie trying to look cool; espionage is the order of the day and it works very well in the context of the film. It is extraordinarily refreshing to see an action film like this, even more when it accomplishes everything it sets out to do and has so much brains. Through action scenes that had you at the edge of your seat, you'd just come to realize that you were only trying to see what the heck was going on. In fact, the film is very efficient on the whole and it never overindulges in anything, which compensates for the amount of talking and allows it to be exciting. The contrast between the cold blooded killing tactics and the warmth and awkwardness that Damon shows in his scenes with Potentate lent great sympathy and likability to him."
5299,"Oh yeah the man who thought she was gonna kill herself turns up everywhere she goes, surprise surprise and cant even use his thick head to understand they are the same person, even though there is no difference in looks except a silly black thing covering her eyes. Knowing only of the old Batman TV show from the 60's, the 90's Cartoon and the brilliant portrayal by Michelle Pfeiffer in Tim Burton's exceptional Batman Returns in 1992."
5300,"Sissi Spaceck's suburban mom is an extraordinary creation. The opening with a startling Ryan Donowho grabs you by your heart and your throat and doesn't let you go. All the reviews are fairly sound--great awesome wonderful sweet emotional very very touching & full of longing & love. Everyone was filling out pink questionnaires for the film--One of the guys collecting them said they had about 200 responses from the previous showings, & of those nearly everyone rated the film as excellent. It is now in DVD, and it is a good movie to see."
4972,"This girl is one of the best comic actresses of her generation and has created a fully rounded character it is difficult not to root for. Of the adults Tim Meadows does sterling work in translating his character with relatively few lines. Neil Flynn (familiar as the Janitor from' Scrubs') is even better with some great facial expressions as a father as much at sea in suburban America as his daughter. Gretchen herself, played by the delectable Lacey Chabert is a character of her own, not just a cardboard minion to follow orders. Neurotic, shallow, desperate, beautiful, loyal and rather uncertain she is perhaps the saddest and most sympathetic of the Plastics - a girl who certainly has the looks and money to make it to the top of the pyramid but who lacked the will or the certainty."
4971,"The movie succeeds in following the humor, witty dialogs and great pace witch made the romantic comedies of old so great. Brosnan is actually becoming a much better actor than he was 6 - 7 years before. The supporting is actually also great, from Sheen, Posey, Fisher, Dunn to the locals in the Irish village. All in all a great screwball comedy which has not been made in years, if the ending were any better. Two top divorce layers battle it out and eventually get romantic about each other."
5925,"They are each original in their own right, although "" Cut "" could be compared to the "" Saw "" or Hannibal Lecter franchises in that there's a psycho who's trying to get a message across by way of murder and mayhem. "" Saam gaang yi "", a. k. a. "" 3 Extremes "", is composed of three segments (1) "" Dumplings "", by Fruit Chan, is the best segment. Some of the set pieces in DUMPLINGS are pretty extreme - the abortion scene is one of the sickest scenes to come out of Asia in 2000s and certainly one of the most perverse set pieces to be commercially released for the Western world. Extremes "" last night, and it was insanely good. more a drama than a horror movie, dumplings is so wonderfully acted that his strange subject have become believable and disturbing."
5336,"Good cast, stylish direction by Jonathan Demme (though now in his trademark style: huge close - ups of people looking right at the camera), some nice suspense. From the start, the original had emotional resonance via its music and credit portraits of the pensive lead players alone. The wonderful trigger line:' Why don't you pass the time by playing a nice game of solitare? ' Classic movies bring the right actors together in the right combination. As good as they are, none of the four leads here â€“ Washington, Streep, Schreiber, Elise â€“ make the emotional connection that their four forbears made."
5337,"Like Shyamalan's other films, it ultimately carries a message of hope and optimism. Their personalities also transcend stereotype, particularly with Phoenix: while stoic and courageous, he's also shy and withdrawn, as revealed in scenes where he passes letters to the public council instead of speaking in front of them. Part of Shyamalan's genius as a filmmaker is that he can achieve the usual responses associated with those genres using such unusual, relatively mundane and realist material. It seems that Shyamalan will always live in the shadow of his masterpiece "" The 6th sense "". Here, ladies and gentlemen, you have a very nicely shot, atmospheric thriller with great cast, good story and a few finishing touches of Shyamalan's cleverness (which could be simply called brilliant when compared with the latest scripts that the Hollywood vomits over its audience!)"
6038,"And when everything is taken into consideration, the writers succeed. Of course the best player on the baseball team is a girl (Foxy Loxy). The premise: A father realizes that it's probably not such a great idea to be embarrassed by his son; by the end of the movie, what his own child thinks of him actually takes precedent over the opinions of neighbors and perfect strangers! The voice - over's for the film were largely uninspiring, save for amusing performances by Don Knotts and Adam West. Disney always makes films kids, teens, and adults alike can enjoy."
8430,"Extremely few comedians are successful, even fewer for more than a year or two and the majority of those few that are still working the large venues, who prove themselves to be other than just some flash - in - the - pan dressed up in an ill - fitting suit of success by an aggressive publicity team and a gullible, entertainment starved audience; usually build their careers on one or two jokes that they've turned into their shtick: they have a quirky personality that is charming or, at least, familiar. And since Americans are becoming more dimwitted and righteous, the bulk of them will not laugh at themselves, the purpose of intelligent humor but prefer the sadistic, mean spirited "" humor "" they see on television (which George satirizes in "" The All - Suicide TV Channel "") or read in those idiotic emails too many people forward to everyone in their address book with titles like "" 10 jokes about rag - heads "" or "" Stop complaining you homeless person "". com) If you watch "" Life is WorthLosing "" for just the opening and closing segments, you will see pure brilliance. It is a masterpiece of comic genius that you will want to add to your library and watch again and again; especially after one of those too frequently increasing moments of realizing the dumbing - down of your fellow countrymen and women is an alarming reality. It's funny watching this eleven years after it was released and seeing just how brilliant Carlin was."
8154,"The locations and cinematography were exotic and the sexy scenes were, well sexy. ' Three' is described as a steamy erotic thriller guaranteed to create an atmosphere so tense you can barely swallow for fear whilst at the same time it is full of hot performances with lavish sexual tension on the screen. The truth is printed on the front cover of the DVD where the crafty devils at the studio placed a rather attractive picture of the lead lady on the front cover of the DVD along with the words "" Kelly finally exposes all . "" Lots of delicious scenes of Kelly in her bikini and a few even more delicious shots of her not in the bikini, also some nude back shots of Juan Pablo DiPace. And some high - intensity love making scenes, definitely make this film worth watching."
7749,"His clues to her non-stereotypical character and feelings are expressed, though, through references that are no longer easy to decode without special historical knowledge - some of it pretty, well, specialized. As in most Dickens, here money - a surfeit and a lack of it - structures the complex comings and goings of a labyrinthine plot. The characters are fabulous and some of them - Skimpole and Mr Guppy, for example - may very well become well - known archetypes due to the popularity and power of this adaptation, in the same way that Micawber and Fagin are. The darkness of the sets makes for some wonderfully expressive design work, and the music is brilliantly chosen. Anna Maxwell shines above all others as Esther Summerson, but hard on her heels are Charles Dance who avoids making an out - and - out villain of Tulkinghorn, Burn Gorman's wonderfully touching Guppy (extra credit to him for hitting the mark in a role that begs to be grotesquely overacted) and Harry Eden's Jo."
7722,"Ms. Parker exhibits great comedic timing and character and has a wonderfully distinctive voice with an expanded opportunity to shine in Jack Jack Attack. This short film, Jack - Jack Attacks, has a very high quality story line and title that catches many young children's attention and makes attracts them into wanting to watch this short film. Its use of highs and lows of intensity are extremely positive and well done. This baby burst into flames, flew through walls and gained incredible strength. However, this short film is created extremely well; it is something that adults may also find interesting and funny to watch with their children."
7653,"The catty love rival, the handsome scheming nice - on - outside - unethical - on - inside pop star, the pining buddy, the mean resort manager, the horny colleague, the arrogant star assistants and minders, the list goes on. Amanda Bynes is absolutely adorable in this film. If you're a fan of Amanda Bynes you might enjoy this just because she's in it playing her usual role, but otherwise, this movie is pretty awful. Randal Klieser did a nice job with this film, and Amanda Bynes and the rest of the cast do a nice job as well."
7367,"Writer / Director Martin Curland did a great job. You could tell by the faces that everyone loved it. The cast is all wonderful & likable - even those who could be deemed' villains' have their own understandable logic. Once with fresh eyes, and again with wisdom. They look enough alike; but, it's the attitude, mannerisms and gestures that really work."
6938,"If you've seen all 51 episodes, the movie is definitely worth watching, if for no other reason than that it significantly progresses the story."
6676,"Anyone who lived in Berkeley or San Francisco in the 60s or 70s will be fascinated! This was very moving and thoughtful film, the filmmaker weaves his own life story into that of the subject, who was a precocious four year old boy in the Haight Ashbury sixties and now an adult trying to figure out his own place in the world. It was like watching years fly by in the blink of an eye, which in a way they actually do, both beautiful and depressing. Possibly not for everyones taste but as someone who didn't live in the sixties or have anything to do with those times it was still a fascinating peak into life at the time and the people who lived during that era. Sean is a great guy, kind of hard to read, maybe mixed up maybe not, Mr Arlyck has done an amazing, deft job of pulling the viewer into this tale."
8547,"Yes, there was a good deal of flesh and as someone else commented the guys looked like your everyday "" joe "" hot guy and not some groomed, tanned, perfectly figured porn guy. There are some well managed sexual encounters and some frontal nudity (but only with Joe Lia and that is so in character that it works well): the chemistry between India and Spencer is palpable and credible. Knowing that director Everett Lewis equated his characters with gay superheros goes a long way toward enjoying this quirky but extremely well - done film. Some have called it' preachy'; but it expresses a sad truth about the common mistreatment of LGBTQ persons with gritty intensity, justified anger, genuine passion, tenderness, and humor that high - budget films usually miss. India and Spencer decide to find them and take retribution, but when they confront Guy, India senses Guy's sexual proclivities and the three return to Destiny's ever growing' family'."
8538,"If the film had remained an exploration of this one fellow's problems with his own life, the premise would have worked really well. His good friend Julie (Joan Lauckner) is supportive and encourages Brad to return home for his parent's wedding anniversary. Everything about the idea of the film makes the viewer want to love it, and it is a sweet little diversion of a film with some thinking material about prejudices."
8537,"The film is chaste enough for straight audiences but has enough gay cheek and some right - on bar scenes that will appeal to the G&L crowd. It has absolutely NO redeeming qualities. Unless you are a gay filmmaker who needs to see what NOT to do, 29th and Gay is a complete and utter waste of time. Luckily James has two very loving and supportive best friends: straight female Roxy, winningly played by Nicole Marcks, and gayer than gay Brandon, portrayed by handsome and adorable David McBean. 29th and Gay is filled with funny scenes and superb supporting performances."
5720,"This is a high concept film--it's basically Jacob's Ladder (1990) meets One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest (1975), with touches of similar "" rubber reality "" and mental institution flicks thrown in for good measure--a dash of Donnie Darko (2001), a touch of 12 Monkeys (1995), and so on. All of the principal actors, including Keira Knightley, Kris Kristofferson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Laura Marano and Kelly Lynch, produce finely nuanced work. The characterizations are demanding, as The Jacket requires them to play multiple realities, with different knowledge, relationships and attitudes to each other in most of the major scenes. But as good as the performances are, what really stands out is the direction. He also employs a lot of intriguing and bizarre inserts, and frequently constructs scenes with unusual pacing, often slower than other modern directors, or at least pulled like taffy on certain beats."
5731,"The use of the United Nations building was a big plus and definitely gave the movie more realism. Needless to point out the breathtaking performances of Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn. . She is one of those women who actually looks better as she ages, and she is a talented actress. How on earth could you imagine an opposition leader of an African country, no matter how small, taking a ride on a street - bus and, what is even more bewildering, discussing political dealings and murders in a pure English with his accuser Nicole Kidman, all this with plenty of, one can assume, English - speaking people around them. Both Kidman and Penn give controlled and emotional performances, although intense and powerful on the inside."
5738,"Rachel gets a job at the local newspaper, and everything is fine and dandy. Elizabeth Perkins and Gary Cole make appearances as a doctor and a Realtor (the latter providing brief, though appreciated comic relief), and Sissy Spacek makes a brief appearance as Samara's birth mother. In all, The Ring Two has a well assembled cast that doesn't disappoint."
5815,", but if you're looking for a above average date movie with more than a few belly laughs, this is your film. There are several scenes that may make you bust a gut laughing. Women will love it, and men may pick up a few pointers. Of course you won't see it up for an Oscar (what a tired joke that is); nor does it contain Quientin Tarantion - esquire dialogue or groundbreaking visuals. Great chemistry between all the leads."
5761,"Depp converts the novel's jaunty, precise Wonka into a quirky one, but it works well, because, as in the novel, Wonka's endearing traits contrast with the fact that he's a tyrant. One of the things that humanized the original Charlie, the polite and thoughtful one amongst a pastiche of brats, is that Charlie too broke the rules, and reasonably invoked Wonka's wrath."
5776,"Michael Keaton crawls out from underneath whatever rock he's been under, does his best "" Bruce Willis in The Sixth Sense "" impersonation, and dives into the world of receiving messages from the dead. When he is approached by Raymond, a man who lost his son years ago and claims he has heard from Jonathan's wife, it draws him into the phenomenon, and pretty soon he becomes obsessed, recording his own tapes and viewing / listening to them for messages."
5777,"Each character was developed uniquely, with many different layers. Number Four, the youngest, tries repeatedly to seduce a moronic kid whose only topic of converse is bungee jumping, and it turns out he doesn't even do that, like Peter Sellers, he likes to watch. Number Four daughter also carries the heavy - handed task of providing subtext, in the form of a stupid computer video ("". Kostner's Denny character, knowing full well what a sleazebag Binder's character is, goes ahead and gets Binder and Daughter Number Three together anyway. The film is a triumph for the two leads."
5791,"The cinematography was beautiful and the colors almost seemed alive, they were so vibrant. Jennifer Garner and Goran Visnjic have a natural rapport and Kirsten Prout was very impressive. Also, with how the villains were thought up, that was also nice."
5792,"Coach Carter received national attention when he locked the gym and benched the whole team for poor grades. Coach Carter taught his players that they must be committed and work hard to excel. He believed that the players must maintain good grades and become a united team or they would not play. The positive message the movie conveyed was that lives can be changed for the better through self discipline, hard work and the building of character. When they made the right decision, they were able to see the positive consequences."
5801,"Directed by Brian Levant, director of Snow Dogs (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) and Jingle All The Way (Arnold Schwarzenegger), he defines his love for making family - fun movies."
5802,"Not new are the abundant clichÃ©s of the horror film: the suspicious neighbors, whom director John Polson makes as creepy as possible; the questionable sheriff; the doors leading to scares; the mutilated dolls; Emily's imaginary friend, Charlie, who appears to be causing numberless offenses in the house; and knives placed as objects of intrinsic interest; and a vulnerable girl friend, Elizabeth (Elisabeth Shue). Sure, the ending is a little clichÃ©, but the rest of the movie was good enough on it's own. Although the film has some interesting moments, director John Polson has gone for the Grand Guignol effect. The audience at the preview enjoyed some of the stock shock moments behind the many closed doors. While there are echoes of Stephen King (The Shining's "" Here's Johnny "" comes to mind) and Hitchcock (think shower scene), there is no comparison in quality with those classics."
5803,"There are a lot of great horror movies out there these days so skip this one! Tim (Barry Watson) is a young man with a great trauma: when his father left his family sixteen years ago, in his imagination his father was indeed taken by the Boogeyman. In the DVD, there is a not good alternate ending, but better and better than the released conclusion. "" Boogeyman "" is watchable, not a masterpiece of the genre, but also not among "" the worst horror movies "" as commented by some users. So pop that DVD in, get the kids out of the room, turn off the lights, and just enjoy the movie for what it tries to do, give you a thrill."
5804,"It also had some very good serious moments between father and daughter, and man to man. As far as romantic comedies go, this one was pretty fun to view at times. More than just a romantic comedy, it is a good people movie in which you can visualize yourself (or someone you know) embodied in one of the cast's believable characters. It was fun and entertaining and a bit above many romantic comedies in the last few years because these two people were actually interesting. The movie was about a wedding, and like weddings it encompasses both endings and beginnings."
5816,"Showing how Deepthroat brought the "" BJ "" into the mainstream of adult films was interesting, and the interviews with the people actually making porn were very insightful. This is a very good primer to understanding Deep Throats impact on sex and censorship. Colorful and sometimes telling and very funny interviews with director Gerald Damiano, star Harry Reems, etc. make this glitzy doc. The directors, Bailey and Barbato, have crafted a superb film inter-cutting old film clips with current interviews in order to create an excellent vision of all the threads between the personalities and opinions of the players. Interviews with Throat director Gerard Damiano & male lead Harry Reems give much insight into the porn biz of those bygone days, a dark world of sex & drug addiction, fly by night productions, and mafia money men."
5818,"Rachel Weisz is terrific as well. One of those characters is The police Detective played by Rachel Weisz, who not only bring a sense of steely determination and strong will to the role but also is a much better lead character than Keanu is. The other interesting character in the film is Papa Midnight who is played by Djimon Hounsou, a demon hunter like Constantine himself but with a lot more charm and personally. All in all, a decent film saved by the game performances of Weisz, Hounsou and the guy from Bush but you will get a sense of seeing this film before. Rachel Weisz was the star of the movie, giving a heartfelt performance."
5819,"The moving clouds with the scene changes were a nice touch and the music was very appropriate. The great book by Kate DiCamillo, is an excellent book for young adults. Though AnnaSophia Robb's inexperience sometimes shows itself in comparison to her co-stars, she imparts a sense of genuine naÃ¯vete and childlike curiosity to the role that would have been difficult to achieve with a more experienced child actress. Opal demonstrated by becoming part of the lives of those Winn Dixie led her to. Together, Opal and Winn Dixie befriend many lonely residents of the small Florida town, and find that their lives are enriched, in addition to improving the lives of the lonely people in this town."
5831,"The children playing the Plummer family work well together, you could believe that they could be a real family (problems and all). Navy Seal and all for one military trained animal, Capt. Shane Wolfe, after a botched assignment, gets reassigned, --- to protect and keep the Plummer family safe while the living parent takes care of business for the other parent, who has been killed suddenly. It has funny moments, touching moments, it gives you chuckles and even a few laughs. A lot of action stars have taken a turn at comedy to soften their image, Stallone and Arnold S. to name a couple, so Vin Diesel is in good company there. It's got enough chuckles and full out belly laugh moments in it for everyone."
5832,"A well - educated rap producer by Cedric the Entertainer, an inept gangster wannabe in Andre 3000, the girl with heart, soul, and a good set of pipes in Christina Milian, a gimmicky black dude wannabe in Vince Vaughn, and a stupid celebrity cameo by Stephen Tyler. The only funny part was the Rock, who invents his own new clichÃ© as a gay Samoan bodyguard actor wannabe. Fortunately for the film, the actors are able to rise above the weak direction and script and they deliver some funny scenes. The first film was good, record producer Tommy Athens (James Woods) tells Chili Palmer (John Travolta) in the opening minutes of "" Be Cool . "" Gray and Steinfeld have successfully stripped all the humor and attitude out of Elmore Leonard's novel, which provided many laughs."
5835,"Then there are the really powerful scenes that shake your soul! Not only is the story well elaborated pure and to the point with no frills but also Bruce Willis has added more facets to his "" last boyscout "" personality. Three teenagers decide to simply steal an SUV from a wealthy accountant just for fun. The house is heavily fortified with armor and bulletproof glass for the owner's protection, but in this case, it protects the boys from the police. The film has a superb storyline with many twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat."
5836,"Robots - This film is pure excellence right from the beginning to the fascinating finale, this animation sees Robin Williams at his best. The scene where Robin Williams character is on the slide thing is one of the best scenes in the movie. 8/10 brilliant but not a patch on Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc or The Incredibles. The movie is also in need of laughs. The funniest moment is the robot who does the robot dance."
5846,"The star of the film worked her hardest against all obstacles to accomplish her goals and realize her dreams, without throwing away her intelligence. Michelle Trachtenberg is a very likable heroine, and both Joan Cusack and Kim Cattrall perform admirably in their respective roles. Just like kids, The Ice Princess is both about growing up as well as the growing up of juvenile / youth movies. The focus on skating, on relationships is great and there is some nice skating shots as well as some surprise cameos. This an entertaining, educational, well done movie about going for one's potential, about dreams lost and hoped for, about conflict and doubt, about mothers and daughters, about rivalry and sharing."
5848,"Enter Treat Williams as the Las Vegas FBI supervisor (Collins) who has ambitions of writing his own book and doesn't care for Gracie coming in and stealing his thunder. Somebody call up Memento, and let it know that a new master of unpredictability is here and its name is Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous! Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous isn't as good as the original but it still manages to deliver some funny scenes. Actually, the fun factor is only seen in Bullock and King everything else was poorly handled."
5849,"Family means everything and without their support, love and consideration, life will be harder. Both Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher give funny performances and they have nice chemistry together. Another funny example is when Ashton Kutcher's character teaches Bernie Mac's character the tango and later on Bernie Mac's character denies to his wife that he was taught the tango by Ashton Kutcher's character. Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher did a wonderful job. There were a lot of funny moments and the movie hardly ever got boring."
5865,"This ease is especially incredible for something so over the top and stylized like this that it's almost hard to imagine that these are the actors you've grown to know and love for years. For years it was a world that only existed on paper in black and white with splashes of color, but it was enough to make Sin City live and breath in ways that few others in the medium have ever been able to come close to. Bruce Willis puts in a solid, if unspectacular turn as Hartigan. The look, cast, atmosphere, everything was just spot on. Sin City in its original serialized comic form was everything that one would expect from the then well known artist / writer / creator Frank Miller and more."
5866,"The dialogue (especially the buddy banter and William H. Macy's character) is amusing, the plot easy to follow despite its complexities, and the action virtually nonstop. It is one of the movies that is constantly entertaining. Treasure Hunters Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino (McConaughey & Zahn) manage to get their hands on a rare confederate coin, apparently which only 5 were made. Before they get going, they run into two W. H. O. workers, one of who was the beautiful Eva Rojas (PenÃ©lope Cruz). He added sort of a friendly charm to the movie and if that is not enough, PenÃ©lope Cruz should make up the difference."
5867,"Sounds sappy but with the nonstop humor and terrific performances this story works! "" Fever Pitch "" is cute, sweet, and has some funny moments. Hopefully, this movie marks the beginning of a better film career for Fallon, something beyond the over-the-top sophomoric humor typical of SNL alums (i. e. Will Ferrell). Romantic comedies really need to be original or have something different to them to escape many of the typical clichÃ©s in this genre. It has a lot of funny moments (including a hilariously disturbing shower scene)."
5882,"The on - screen format of the guide itself is an appropriate update of the format developed for the television series, and it's highly enjoyable to see such delightfully silly animations grace a giant cinema screen. This is interesting, because (here analysis becomes problematic since it is impossible to know which changes were instigated by Adams and which were down to Karey Kirkpatrick), none of the characters in Adams' earlier material really had any significant motivations that would lend them to becoming interesting protagonists in a more conventional setting. One of the first casualties of this is that the principle players overshadow others, who are introduced, half - heartedly expanded upon, and then almost entirely dropped in deference to the favoured few. Perhaps someone braver could have produced something more appropriate, or perhaps this is the best that there could ever be. Fans rushed to their nearest webring to console each other when they discovered the bum - clenchingly great scripting responsibilities had been passed on to Karey Kirkpatrick, the brains behind fluffy kiddie flick, Chicken Run."
5883,"Definitely one of the movie's most startling moments, but also it's most brutally disappointing. If you completely ignore anything and everything that has to do with the Amityville stories, then this is a pretty decent horror flick. You expect a treat, and you get sucker punched right in the family jewels."
5886,"The movie wasn't horrible, it was cute, had a few heartfelt themes, wonderful chemistry, good performances and a story that should have promised two characters that you would never forget. Like many other teeny bopper chick flicks, this movie can be compared to a group of other movies. He's such a good actor for teenage movies. The movie is well acted by Amanda Peet not to mention she looks stunning, and though Ashton Kutcher does overact some scenes he delivers a believable character. Kutcher and Peet each deliver endearing performances and actually play against the urge to gratuitously combust making for just the right emotional veracity and sexual tension to keep it real."
5887,"One powerful theme in "" The Smartest Guys in the Room "" is expressly articulated and repeated for emphasis: this is the story of people, not arcane financial accounting methods or numbers, and because it is people, it can happen again. Enron is just the manifestation of the evil begotten by hubris, in spectacularly public fashion. It is classic Greek tragedy, and it is one from which its chief protagonists, Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling, must not escape. Alex Gibney's absorbing documentary, based on the book co-authored by the first prominent whistle blower and Enron executive, Bethany McLean, begins with the tragic concept of the pervasive fatal flaw, hubris, and applies it meticulously to the tragic figures Ken Lay, Andrew Skilling, and Andrew Fastow. Tragic in the sense that those talented executives allowed the company to fall while they lined their pockets with the assets of its 20, 000 employees, countless investors, and the state of California, which suffered mammoth losses due to its new energy deregulation and manipulation of that energy by Enron."
5888,"Opening with an impressive first 7 - 8 minutes, this film moves into cookie cutter territory at a frightening speed and continues to derail any opportunity for the audience to engage in the ridiculous plot or heavily computer generated action sequences. Hopefully with the resoundingly negative response xXx2 has currently received another sequel looks unlikely, as films like this are about as satisfying as a having your nose broken. With his gadgets expert in tow, Gibbons turns to a new Triple X agent to help him fight this threat â€“ former comrade and now life prisoner, Darius Stone. At times it all gets a bit much and just looks plain silly but it never really stops moving that long so the next boom or bang is only ever minutes away, preventing you turning your brain on. Diesel can deliver the action and stunts solidly but he's so annoying when it comes to dialog and comedy moments."
5889,"In 1935, Cecil B. DeMille made his famous epic "" The Crusades "" on one of the backlots of Hollywood. The recreation of medieval France and the city of Jerusalem were brilliant technical achievements. The French landscape recalls the region around medieval Clermont and VÃ©zelay where Pope Urban and Bernard of Clairvaux delivered their momentous calls to arms for the early Crusades. The film's events spanned the era between the Second and Third Crusades, and the evocation of this epoch was simply spectacular. In the genre of the epic film, the leading actor is crucial, as in the unforgettable performances of "" Lawrence of Arabia "" (Peter O'Toole), "" Tess "" (Nastassja Kinski), and "" Bridge on the River Kwai "" (Alec Guiness)."
5890,"The murders were genuine and realistic looking while the cinematography was great! Carly Jones (Elisha Cuthbert) and her boyfriend, Wade (Jared Padalecki) are going to the big college football game with a group of friends and her brother, Nick (Chad Michael Murray). If you are into horror movies, then this one comes highly recommended. The production design and sets are excellent, and the cast makes the most of their under - written roles. Elisha Cuthbert is also good, moving up from her previous movie, the atrocious "" The Girl Next Door . """
5897,"This Movie focuses More on the dramatic Storyline, then rather on spectacular Fights. Nonetheless very impressive Fights are in the Movie, it is the Storyline between Danny (Li), Bart (Hoskins), Sam (Freeman) and Victoria (Condon) that keeps you in the Movie. The first two Fights are excellent because they are shot very realistic and with a fast paced camera, the last Fights are more graphical and slowly filmed. Louis Leterrier did a very good Job filming this Movie. a lot of transporter like action scenes and a very unusual appearance of Morgan freeman in the film make this absolutely worth watching."
5898,"The upside is that these moments are rare in Episode III. This has the best action sequences of any of the six Star Wars films! The battle sequences at the beginning with Jedi star fighters and separatist forces is by far the most spectacular special effects sequence ever put to film. Acting wise, Heyden Christensen does a much better job this time around portraying the darker Anakin Skywalker as he heads towards his destiny, all of the wooden Anakin from The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones is finally free from his shackles this time around. Ewan McGregor, excellent as always does a great job portraying Obi - Wan Kenobi as a jedi master who knows his pupil is headed for the dark side."
5899,"It's strange how people look at Will Farrell movies & think Will is the funny guy. In this movie where the Bad News Bears do soccer in a way, Will Ferrell makes Mike Ditka look good. If you rent and watch the Bad News Bears then watch this movie it will pretty obvious the movie copied it almost completely. If you're a parent with kids in AYSO soccer, or a kid that plays (ed) the game, then you'll love this mindless, uplifting comedy about a coach going to the extreme to help his Tigers soccer team win. Also, the appearance from Mike Ditka, tight end in the NFL from 1961 to 1972 and coach of the Chicago Bears from 1982 to 1992, is a great accentuating ingredient to this film."
5900,"The film was crisp, just over 90 minutes, and well written. The stars â€” and their fans â€” deserve better than this. Her scenes with Jane Fonda are the best things about the movie though she gets a little annoying. Jane Fonda is one of the great stars in the Hollywood firmament."
5904,"On the whole, though, the presentation is quick - paced, bright, happy, and delightful to the eyes and ears. The humor is one of Dreamworks best. A lot of fun and a lot of laughs. A wonderful movie for all ages. They deliver almost nothing but laughs."
5906,"Yet, the eventual winners stand out from the first moment they appear, almost exonerating director Agrelo from the intimacy requirement; also, that communal experience is better explained through the roving camera and long shots of their dancing. The film takes the dance sequences and interweaves them with the children's lives outside of school but in a way that demonstrates why the dancing is so important. "" Mad Hot Ballroom "" directed by Marilyn Agrelo, who is working with her collaborator, Amy Sewell, will put anyone into a good mood because it's a disarming view at inner city children who have benefited a lot from this experience. This is reflected in some of the judges, especially Ann Reinking, who seems happily surprised by some of the kids on stage. The strength of Ballroom is the enthusiasm of teachers who have little to gain but the biggest prize of all â€” the success of their charges."
5907,"Unless you are open - minded, you will never find the hidden treasures of the movie world. Some of the best performances actually come from people you might not expect. If you instead want to watch something funny with Sandler, watch Litte Nicky, Happy Gilmore or Spanglish. It's genius characterizations of what some prison inmates might act like work perfectly."
5908,"Ron Howard has made of the real life of Depression - era prize - fighter James J. Braddock a work of art. Crowe as Braddock with hat in hand and tears in his eyes, begging for twenty dollars so he can get his children back into his home, is the personification of pride sacrificed to desperation. Craig Bierko, Paddy Considine, Bruce McGill and the rest of the cast give flawless performances. The threesome of Russell Crowe, as the fighter Braddock, and Renee Zellweger, as his wife, and Paul Giamatti, as his manager were Academy - Award worthy. The cast is perfect and, under Ron Howard's confident hand, all give amazing performances."
5909,"everything that makes a movie great. The only magic realism in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants is the one, one - size - fits - all pair of jeans worn the four female friends, whose summer adventures bring a dose of realism magical only for the insights into life, the pain and pleasure that come in from age seventeen to the end. As a coming - of - age film, this ranks with the best of them for non-condescending, adult - like perceptions, with nary a "" like "" in the girls' vocabulary. The rest of the seats were packed with girls of all ages, older women, teens, mothers, college grads, you name it."
5910,"If you feel unsatisfied with what you have learnt about the z - boys and Dogtown go and watch Peralta's documentary Dogtown and Z - boys. Engblom recruited the best skaters for the Zephyr Team. Director Catherine Hardwicke ("" Thirteen "") does an outstanding job of re-creating the seedy '70s atmosphere so much so that you could be forgiven for assuming you were watching archival outtakes from "" Z - Boys . "" Hardwicke really nails that sense of post-Vietnam, rejection of authority of SoCal. Director Catherine Hardwicke, who helped a few teenagers discover the versatility of the tongue in "" Thirteen "" (2003), takes an impressive cast and crew back to the year 1975."
5911,"Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie will only fuel rumors of their relationship with their performances - their chemistry on screen is scintillating, to say the least. But the action is kickin, the acting well above par, the leads luminous, the plot is lots of fun, and the laughs are plenty. This is a daaaamn fun movie! You could tell that they really loved each other, yet at the same time were committed to their jobs. The actors and actresses did their jobs well - and they certainly are' beautiful people' for the screen."
5912,"Another noted item: If you have the 2D version, it seems to be far superior to the 3D. She thought it was hilarious when Lavagirl zapped Sharkboy because he said someone else was prettier. Sharkboy moves well in action scenes and would be more aptly suited to a martial arts style role. Kids under 12 will probably be best entertained by Sharkboy & Lavagirl."
5914,"Characters: Vidya Balan was exceptionally good. In fact the ease with which she played the character, makes one wonder if she is a dÃ©butante. Well done Vidhu Vinod Chopra, you have again found a VERY talented young lady. But what makes it special is the entire "" package "" - no over-the-top acting here, great period sets, smooth narration and actors who give a good dimension to the characters they portray. PS: Like another reviewer pointed out here, watch this film on the big screen or its original DVD release that does complete justice to the beautiful cinematography and art direction!"
5917,"The story is as good an origin story as you'll find - covering all the major (true - to - the - comic) events, and not wasting ages on them. Gary Oldman looks just like a young Commissioner Gordon (and doesn't dominate), Morgan Freeman and Rutger Hauer give solid heavyweight support to the boardroom machinations at Wayne Enterprizes. The soundtrack, like all the best original soundtracks, is excellent - you hardly know it's there, but the emotions of the scene are enhanced and boosted. What's impressive is that despite the weight of the franchise, Nolan has managed to work so many of his trademarks into a mainstream movie. The story does not progress in linear fashion for the first half, and there are some truly spectacular hallucination scenes."
5920,"It was also pretty original and employed modern racing car themes like monster trucks and NASCAR. So many other movies these days have various flaws that keep coming to mind when you watch them; this movie was just fine. It doesn't explain why Herbie, in the time between the previous movie and this movie went downhill as a racer, and why Herbie had been forgotten by the racing community (and its audience) - you would think a Beetle that kept winning races would be remembered by SOMEONE! After the delightful homage or tribute to past Herbie movies through shots of the old Herbie during the opening credits, Fully Loaded Herbie tries unsuccessfully to recreate an updated version of the 60s Herbie slapstick that doesn't stick at all and backfires black smoke."
5921,"The living who are fortunate enough to be inside the walled - off city spend their lives eating the crumbs of the rich. Into the mix comes Asia Argento, who plays a tough, impossibly gorgeous hooker named Slack. The Dead Reckoning truck was a good idea--finally someone in a zombie movie realized you need an armored vehicle to ensure your own safety, although nobody has learned yet that you should probably cover all exposed skin to avoid bites from the living dead. Highly recommended for those whose take zombie movies as seriously as they should. By far the biggest threats in Romero's movies (most notably "" Big Daddy "" (Eugene Clark)."
5922,"The cute and funny parts are few and far between. MANY of the performances are great. Michael Caine was excellent and Steve Carell is SPOT ON as Uncle Arthur. with "" dream "" sequences, the appearance of characters who may or may not be mere figments of someone's imagination and the ability of "" Samantha "" to turn back time indefinitely to erase any of her spells that may have gone awry. Though there are funny bits, the supporting cast is unused despite the star power and potential."
5941,"For every new ingredient added (a kid in a wheelchair, Hooters waitresses on the sidelines, a skateband interlude), there's a classic sequence dropped, funny lines omitted, a bracing sense of importance missing, and uncharismatic, non-plussed child actors who walk through their roles colorlessly. Beneath the somewhat reptilian outer skin of Billy Bob's Buttermaker is a human being who has compassion and understanding for others who are in his' peer group', that is, the rejects and also - rans of life."
5923,"Even if this is not your style of music or dancing, this documentary is definitely worth a look to see how some people take something so difficult and so bad in their lives and turn it into something good. This is an amazing look into the reality of the lives that these people live, right down to individual dance parties, some of the unwritten social rules of the people who dance together (the styles change so quickly that they can tell who has missed even a single day of dancing), and tragic events that take place in their everyday lives. Rize gives these dancers something the rest of society has long denied them â€“ dignity and respect. Ethnomusicologist Nick Spitzer of Public Radio's American Routes show could certainly teach them all something about the recurring phenomenon in the African diaspora of similar competitive "" families "" created around dancing and costumes or make - up, including the samba clubs in Brazil, the Mardi Gras "" Indians "" of New Orleans and the carnival crews of the Caribbean. While the story line wanders a bit after the climactic Battle Zone, LaChappelle forcefully links the the dancing to Pentecostal and Baptist gospel traditions for the life affirming conclusion."
5924,"His elder son, Peter (Miles Thompson) longs for connections that go beyond instant gratification, while the younger Robby (Brandon Ratcliff) gets all the funniest lines, mostly copied and pasted from cybersex chats. Although this is as great as anything in the first 75 minutes of "" Before Sunset, "" its emphasis is much more on romantic comedy than the rest of the movie. There are more typical scenes that approach this quality. And unlike Garden State (which is still a great film), it captured those random, lovely, hard - to - put - into - words bits of human emotion without having to try as hard. The film follows the lives and dreams of many truly memorable characters, from the adorable and fascinating children to the adults with all their idiosyncrasies."
5931,"What Spielberg, Cruise, and Koepp accomplish here in the first two acts is nothing short of revolutionary. While it's true that Wells' original ending creates a problem for a movie, here they try to remain faithful to it, while still shoehorning moments of triumph into the conclusion. Apart from a decent enough alien fighting machine, this was an artless pastiche of many superior versions of this overused story. "" War of the Worlds "" is Steven Spielberg's third movie in which extraterrestrials visit Earth, but the first in which their intentions are malevolent. After the screening, some people cheered and clapped, others sat in disgust and laughed."
5932,"If you have any interest in nature, penguins, or just want to see a touching story of the amazing journey that penguins make simply to perpetuate their breed, definitely check this film out in theatres. The characters are well developed; the hero more beautifully photogenic than Brad Pitt and A. Jolie combined; the plot is compelling; and though the ending can never be in doubt its story is both riveting and the resolution impactful. He succeeded in making the story dramatic, compelling, and comprehensible to younger viewers. "" The March of the Penguins "" has to be one of the most beautiful documentaries in recent memory."
5933,"The audience is repeatedly shown how out of touch with basketball Coach Roy has become by showing many examples of his advertisements, his flashy car, his expensive suits, etc. . There are many genuinely funny bits, and Megan Mullally is an absolute hoot in her role, which was far too small. In this case, the reluctant coach, Roy McCormick, is played by Martin Lawrence, who attempts to single - handedly provide some unique quality to this film in order to distinguish it from all other kid movies. The movie is well made, with many amusing personalities, and good acting on the part of several of the kids. One of the prime examples of this is a scene where he is teaching a kid not to be a ball hog on the court."
5934,"Once more, a great injustice has been done by IMDb voters. 4, with 16% of the voters giving it a 1! It does take its time establishing and developing the relationships and the characters, but since the movie is all about the characters, that's a good thing. Other than that, the film does strike the right chords more often than not, and provides a lot of touching, sad moments. Its composition, as scripted by the talented and sensitive Rafael Yglesias is closer to the Henry James tradition of serene Gothic tales than to the strident antics of today's conception of horror (Ring, Ring 2, Boogeyman, The Grudge, etc.) In hindsight."
5935,"The team manage to get all their character back - stories, exposition - based conversations and marriage proposals out of the way in good time, before turning their attention to some rather vital defence shields. But it's hard to deny that, in places, it's also fairly entertaining. This movie is so fun that you wish these people did exist and would take some media focus off the jerks that are in the public eye. Where they had acting heavyweights, Fantastic Four has a couple of notable talents from successful TV series and a couple of almost - stars, with broad appeal but little charisma to bring to the mix. Unlike successful superhero franchises like X-Men and Spider - man, there's no respected director and no attempt to give the film a thematic depth or real world resonance."
5936,"It also shows great examples of strong, life - affirmation, courage, wisdom and at the same time presents the reality of a handicapped life. And what is very important: sport is something which heals even very sad lives. These moments are touching, inspiring, and the doc's best moments. It appears that who ever has possession of the ball is likely to score meaning that winning the game comes down to having the ball in the closing seconds. It greatly succeeds, though, in exploring the lives of the athletes."
5937,"Their plans to crash the upscale wedding of a high - profile politician (Christopher Walken) go awry when John falls in love with the politician's daughter (Rachel McAdams) and the two guys end up spending the weekend with her family The support cast share the comedy reasonably well; McAdams is cool and appealing, Fisher is a bit OTT but is funny, Seymour plays on her sexy image really well while Walken is reliable as ever as Christopher Walken. The supporting cast are also an asset, Christopher Walken expertly walks the tightrope of being both broodingly intimidating and likable, while Rachel McAdams' ' Claire' has a charming vulnerability and an easy - to - fall - in love with quality. Not a great comedy then but certainly good enough to please anyone who liked Anchorman, Dodgeball and other films of similar styles of humour. Vaughn is hilarious and proofs, that he's much better in comedies than in "" serious "" movies."
5938,"Lisa Kudrow, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Jason Ritter shine in an impressive cast that effectively portrays a wide spectrum of emotions all in a darkly comic light. In this role, Lisa Kudrow really excels with the writer - director's dryly observant style: she's loose but not flailing, inquisitive but not harping, apprehensive but seldom frightened. Kudrow (whose comic timing reminds one of Roseanne's in the early years of her sitcom) mixes a look of anxiety, despair, nervousness and anticipation with astonishing skill--even when her character is humiliated (or humiliates herself), Kudrow has a way of keeping all the flightiness grounded in some form of reality. Matching her, Tom Arnold and Maggie Gyllenhaal have some wonderful early scenes (she's a born user and a killer karaoke singer; he's the father of the gay twenty - one year old drummer whom she has already seduced and discarded). Roos plants little subtitles throughout the movie to help sort out who's - who, and this works to some degree (yet it's a relief when the device is momentarily given a rest)."
5939,"The female cast who constitute DJay's trade are Eminem's ex-girlfriend in 8 Mile, Taryn Manning and Paula Jai Parker as the outspoken Lexus, again all providing non-sterling but convincing turns as part of the phat pack. The increasingly talented Terence Howard (recently seen in Ray and Crash), plays DJay, a pimp turned rapper who wants to prove his worth and swap his tricks for a trade in America's crunked up south. As well as these two familiar songsters, Anthony Anderson and DJ Qualls, of Road Trip fame, make up the group and put in solid performances. In one of the most raw and intense performances of recent memory, newcomer Terrence Howard embodies D - Jay with an animal - like ferocity that will help you overcome what few formulaic clichÃ©s embody the script. When he obtains the keyboard, inspiration strikes, and a chance encounter with an old classmate (Anthony Anderson) who's now a producer (of sorts) gives DJay the opportunity to jump out of the rotten life he's carved for himself."
5940,"So all of the world's survivors live in this compound with the ultimate goal of going to the Island, where everyone can live a safe and happy life. Djimon Hounsou has a pretty good part. One good reason to see the film: great visuals, good looking people with consistent positive ideals. The clones are told that the outer world is contaminated and that the only safe place left is "" the island "". Also, Djimon Hounsou, Michael Clarke Duncan, Steve Buscemi and Sean Bean did fine jobs with their roles."
5942,""" Three of the more interesting deranged killers from "" House Of 1000 Corpses "" get their own spin - off in the "" Frasier "" or "" Jeffersons "" tradition. watching slasher movies throughout a lot of your life. The movie is actually a lot smarter and more complex than you might imagine, if you're unfamiliar with what Zombie's movies are about. The dialogue is written a twisted brilliant way and the direction has a real retro -' 70's homey - quality to it. And not just in real life, but in movies as well."
5943,"And in its way it's every bit as good as its predecessors, "" Gerry "" and "" Elephant, "" and like them is HBO - sponsored and exquisitely filmed in a boxlike and claustrophobic small format. One's clearly "" Asia, "" Asia Argento, and she's sleeping with "" Scott, "" Scott Green, and there's "" Luke, "" Lucas Haas, tall and gangly in Coke - bottle glasses. Van Sant has drawn this fall out over 90 minutes where, lets be honest, not a great deal actually happens. Gus Van Sant, just as he had done in Gerry and in Elephant, has taken a real - life mystery, and filled in some of the trivial missing parts with his imagination. He is constantly running away, pursued by everyone, but unable to face his obligations."
5944,"A lot of laughs for kids and grownups, a couple of good plot twists, and a nice message for the youngsters. Very entertaining for the kids, and some nice laughs for parents too (during the Sidekick lessons given by ex-All American Boy for instance: lots a references to the Robin from the Batman TV - series). As someone who grew up during the Love Bug, Benji era of Disney live action kids movies, it's a nice change of pace. Okay, there are a lot of crazy special effects in this movie, but the story is actually driven by the nice performances by almost all the actors instead of lots of SFX. The original little ideas dry out after the first half of the movie, but who said that all family movies should have Oscar power?"
5945,"It all begins simply enough with the same old introduction of the piloting dream team (for more information on high flying dream teams, please reference Top Gun, Apollo 13, and the 1992 Olympic Men's Basketball Finals). This film is a clear illustration of the ill thought out comic book imagination of Bush and his middle America supporters writ large. Stealth follows the exploits of three Navy pilots in a top secret program involving, well, experimental stealth fighters. The movie's plot starts by introducing a trio of hotshot pilots who fight hard, play hard, and have perfect hair and teeth while doing it. You have Ben Gannon (Josh Lucas), the fearless leader who is wild, unpredictable, and doesn't like to follow orders, but, gosh dangit, he's the best darned pilot they have."
5946,"This movie had all the ingredients necessary to be one of those romantic comedies that are also' good' films. Just goes to show you that without the right screenwriter, even strong players can come across as high school acting students. There are some Yeat's recitations. Many are plausible and elicited excited guffaws from the audience. The plot is nothing new and there are many clichÃ©s to be found here yet the film is still funny."
5947,"And in this regard, it stands as one of the funniest films ever made. Bob Saget is surely the most startling (and one of the funniest). The result is some of the most hilarious film - making of recent years. This allows some of the best American comic minds to muse wildly about humor. The film itself centers around a single premise: A joke with the punch line "" The Aristocrats! """
5950,"The others do a good job gushing about the movie. The best way to describe it is to take the best aspects of the Han Solo elements of the original Star Wars, and build a world around that. The humor is probably better than anything in the theaters this year, and the action is even greater. This movie really does have something for everyone, and even in the core of the geek fandom, the range of people is total - men and women split it at least 50/50, uber - geeks and "" cool "" types, and a surprising amount of attractive people of all ages. If you saw Star Wars (the original) in the theater way back when, then this movie will evoke a similar feeling of awe."
5952,"It's very smart, well - made and entertaining, directed with sure - handed control, full of quirky, funny moments and superb acting. He continues the sort of' phase' he's been in starting with Lost in Translation and going somewhat into The Life Acquatic - now his is reactions which make up the best parts, and the occasional zingers work well against the supporting cast. Broken Flowers, unlike C&C is a narrative poem. The deeper emotions of his more serious characters are harder to read. And his extraordinary, almost unique' innerness' as an actor makes you work hard."
5954,"He took a fun show from the early 80's and made it into a fun show for the new millennium. the only cast member that had a good southern accent was Willie Nelson, AND THATS CAUSE ITS REAL! Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville both give below average performances. Johnny Knoxville is his usual eccentric self and along with Seann William Scott as Cousin Bo the pair make this film really funny in a hilarious Dumb - And - Dumber sort of way the TV series never achieved. Otherwise if you want an entertaining car - action movie with a few good laughs that's not too taxing on the brain then go see this enjoyable romp with an open mind."
5955,"Chumscrubber, which obviously belongs to the first group, is a rather unique and courageous satirical attempt of showing on the surface quiet and peaceful life of suburbia and middle class people there. Dean Stiffle's best friend Troy, a teenager who supplied drugs to a local high school commits a suicide and a company of school tough guys believe that Dean knows where to find Troy's store. All in all, this is one of those movies that obviously started with a great story â€” full of dramatic tension and social satire â€” and built from there. Justin Chatvin is strong enough as a company leader Billy and the youngest of characters, Thomas Curtis as Charley Bratley steal the show in a couple of crucial moments. The cast is great and stars like Glenn Close and Ralph Fiennes show their talent by underplaying their roles or playing offbeat characters like they never have before."
5956,"Her visit brings some home truths that the family had been putting off. There is something about Junebug that will surprise everyone. No, it is that you are actually impressed by the acting from The O. C.'s Benjamin Mckenzie (shortened to "" Ben "" here). Ben Mackenzie makes his character surprisingly well layered, revelling in the quietly sad scenes â€“ he tries to tape a show about meercats for his wife but can't, and ends up taking it out on her. "" Junebug "" is a ruefully sweet, clear - eyed take on the going home genre that usually takes the form of prodigal child returning due to a funeral or serious illness with guilt hanging in the air until it ignites an explosion."
5957,"He gave Deuce Bigalow a cute and innocent charm which was important in making Deuce Bigalow likable. There is much eye for detail, like the shirts Deuce is wearing, or the fact that he calls Eva' ay - va' as the Dutch would do, the fun with the street name (' Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal', notorious in Holland for its red - light district) and the names and phone - numbers in the little black book (DVD freeze frame). the cover of the Dutch version DVD is much more appropriate, showing an Amsterdam pavement divider post (' Amsterdammertje') instead of the Italian (! Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo"" is funny, yet a silly movie. "" Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo "" is politically incorrect, rude, gross but also hilarious and extremely funny."
5958,"But it is very well shot and has some strong acting performances in it. Gena Rowlands and Peter Saarsgard are fine, but their performances are hampered by the' all too obvious' script and direction. The mix of influences includes' Turn of the Screw',' Rosemary's Baby' ' Burn Witch Burn and a few other classics but that is to give nothing away for it absorbs them into something quite new. Gena Rowlands and John Hurt (immobile and mute for most of the film) are fairly good in their respective roles as the married couple with more than just skeletons in their closets. Fans of atmospheric ghost stories (such as "" The Others "" or "" Angel Heart "") will particularly enjoy this film as it contains almost no graphic violence or gory monsters."
5959,"Four Brothers is a gritty, testosterone - fueled crowd pleaser that mixes drama, action, and humor. But if you're in the mood to see some bad guys get pumped full of bullets and fists then this will put a smile on your face. One good thing Steven Spielberg has done for 21th century movies is to show the importance of starting things off with a bang rather than a whimper, something he learned from the old grade B films of the 30's, 40's, and 50's. The plot is well executed through twists and turns. One is that Fall / Winter feel - good, and more animated movies than you can count are coming to theaters."
5960,"Gen. Douglas MacArthur - thanks to Roosevelt's decision to devote more to the European effort through the Lend - Lease to Churchill program - is forced to evacuate the Philippines and retreat to Australia. The best film in this genre was probably 1957's "" Bridge On The River Kwai, "" which won Oscars for David Lean and Alex Guinness, among others, but that was almost 50 years ago. Meanwhile, thousands of American troops are trapped by the swift - moving Japanese forces on the islands of Bataan and Corrigidor and are compelled to surrender. Its three interconnected story lines--the prisoners in Cabanatuan, the Rangers, and the underground movement in Manila (including a nurse played by Nielsen who smuggles in Quinine to prisoners)--give a fairly accurate and well rounded portrait of the landscape of war in the Philippines, although by the end of the film you do feel as if you've only seen the tip of the iceberg. The valiant efforts of the underground that smuggled medicine to the ill and dying prisoners; the array of authority figures in the military who made heart - rending decisions about strategy and tactics; the rescue mission that galvanized a unit of 120 special rangers who had yet to see the extreme fires of combat; the unlikely relationships that bound survivors in their fate."
5961,"And Mr. Herzog did an extraordinary job putting it all together. The arguments were made that acquainting himself with them, he was doing much more harm then good. Grizzly Man works on a lot of different levels. Like all addicts, Timothy became progressively self - centered, isolated, paranoid, confused, controlling, perfectionist, blinded to his disease (denial), insane, blaming (projection), and dysfunctional. For thirteen years "" grizzly man "" Timothy Treadwell went to an Alaskan wildlife refuge on Kodiak Island and pitched his tent alone--and the last couple of times with a girlfriend (Amy Huguenard)--spending the summers among huge grizzly bears."
5962,"Recommended for anyone that likes their movies slow, touching and real. The timing, of course, is impeccable, with the G8 summit to be held in Scotland within 2 weeks and widespread attention of the summit brought to the masses by Sir Bob Geldof and the simultaneous Live 8 series of concerts. Thus begins this romantic comedy with political overtones directed with great flair by David Yates and based on a screen play by Richard Curtis, a writer who knows a thing, or two, about human relations, as demonstrated by his previous work. Played to absolute perfection by Bill Nighy and especially Kelly MacDonald, and written by Richard Curtis with his usual wry wit, this drama places a socially aware Everywoman in the same room as the world's most powerful politicians at a fictional G8 Summit in Reykjavik. Ultimately, the film punches out its challenge to the movers and shakers of the G8 to' be great . '"
5965,"The virgin of the title is Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell), who is indeed 40, works as an employee at an electronics store and collects vintage action figures, which are displayed all throughout his nice bachelor pad for all to see. The truth is, Andy loves women, but past traumatic experiences (revealed hilariously one after the other in a flashback sequence) have put him on the sidelines for good. Carell is sweet and human, as his character is not some layabout who approaches this thing with his eyes shut. Stealing hilarious scenes from Bruce Almighty and especially Anchorman, Steve Carell has come a long way, as finally, and proudly, is given his moment to shine as the star. The brilliant writing of Judd Apatow and Steve Carell genuinely has purpose and it's not just one hell of a story to tell."
5966,"Hitchcock understood that people go the the movies to have a good time. This is a thriller, but it has plenty of laughs and always has one eye winking at the camera. Rachel McAdams is wonderful as always. "" Red Eye "" is a really fun film and people were applauding when the closing credits started rolling. When she meets Cillian Murphy (the Scarecrow in "" Batman Begins "") in what appears to be happenstance, the film really takes flight."
5977,"He also acts as an independent agent for undisclosed countries supplying arms to "" freedom fighters "". "" Jared Leto is surprising as the coke head brother, who eventually cops to the monster he has become â€” the counterpoint to Yuri. Bridget Moynahan is deceivingly powerful as Ava, the former model aware that her asset of being pretty is fading, and closes her eyes to what her husband does until it is too late. Ethan Hawke as Jack Valentine is the intrepid idealist saving the world from the likes of Yuri. The echoes of Yuri voice, just "" evil prevails "" is a chilling and poignant reminder."
5968,"The point is that in searching for a resolution to complete the narrative, you will have gone over the clues over and over, replaying each scene in your head for meaning. "" CachÃ© "" is a monumental proof of Haneke's COMPLETE command of his craft. Artistic achievements like this are now SO rare in films that "" CachÃ© "" feels like a happening--a work of art that is mind - boggling, hypnotic and physically unnerving, ethically and esthetically disturbing, combining the sense of revelation and discomfort you get with the best political films with the braincells workout you get with the best thrillers. Michael Haneke the austere Austrian director of such critically acclaimed films as "" Funny Games "", "" Code Unknown "" and "" The Piano Teacher "" has created in "" CachÃ© "" (Hidden) his finest film to date. "" CachÃ© "" is at once an intriguing thriller and a wonderful examination of guilt and responsibility in a very modern context."
5970,"This is an animated comedy of a British Valiant - pigeon who enlists to "" The Royal Pigeon Message Service "" of the World War II. It has come to be a habit for animations to contain loads of references to other movies and general pop - culture so that adults can have their own fun while their descendants laugh at animation characters' slapstick. Not Shrek, but a quite hilarious little film for adults and children alike! It turns out that he does Britain a great service in World War II as a messenger pigeon. The movements are smooth, and the birds are portrayed in great detail."
5971,"But for the moviegoer looking for beautiful cinematography, a few good laughs, and a fairly suspenseful story, look no further. "" The Brothers Grimm "" is an underrated dark fable, homage to the authors of a great number of fairy tales, the Brothers Grimm. Lena Headey and Monica Bellucci are extremely beautiful, as usual, and they have good performances. It has moments of suspense, breath - taking imagery, and stylized humor. These are the moments when the director's creative magic appears to shine through, and there's enough of them to make this movie worth watching."
5972,"The sets are realistic, with spaces and formations that one might see in certain large caverns. The lighting is appropriately subdued with interesting colors and unusual camera angles. Viewers looking for a credible story will need to exit the cave. Incidentally, the Korg tuners are very good - at tuning guitars. While he's no Spielberg or Cameron, he keeps the camera angles interesting, and there are scenes within vast, tall rooms in the cave that are quite breathtaking."
5973,"Crisp and heartfelt thriller that gives you the right shot in the arm with an Oscar caliber performance by Rachel Weisz and an equally Oscar worthy performance by Ralph Fiennes. The real showstopper here is the performance of Rachel Weisz, who gives the right balance of self - righteousness, heart and determination with her role. This film truly rewards its audience as it works on so many levels. What's even more amazing is that all of the timely political discourse and subsequent thriller aspects of the film (courtesy of the source material, John Le Carre's novel) are wrapped up in a timeless romance. Intelligent and moving political thriller that should be held right up there with "" All The Presidents Men "" and "" The Killing Fields "" as one of the best political thrillers ever made."
5974,"This is an action movie with twists and turns, some believable, some not so. Bottom Line: If you like fun, dumb action movies, you'll probably love this. The original had a thin premise and an anorexic plot but delivered brilliantly choreographed fight scenes and down - played gun violence. Mr. Billings (Matthew Modine) is an important member of the government and Mrs. Audrey Billings (Amber Valletta) trusts on Frank, who promises to protect the boy. If, on the other hand, you want to pay good money to sit in a theater and keep a mental list of all the problems, bs, bad lines, and so on, it's your life."
5975,"It recalls comedies of the past, when characters were developed and actors work their magic on the screen. Mark Ruffalo and Reese Witherspoon are both excellent, but sometimes when two astounding actors act opposite one another, a movie flops--this is not such a movie. They are two great actors who make fun comedies. The amazing surprise is Mr. Ruffalo, as her smitten "" friend "". It has been a good season for romantic comedies."
5976,"There are very dramatic changes in emotion from moment to moment, and Paltrow pulls it off brilliantly. Hope Davis and Jake Gyllenhaal also gave solid performances, but their as with Hopkin's role were really nothing more than support Paltrow. For a film that revolves around brilliant mathematical proofs, there's an almost painful scarcity of and real math in the film. If you want an intelligent well written and presented story of substance involving a a character experiencing a roller - coaster of emotions, Proof may be for you. "" Catherine, "" the daughter of a brilliant mathematician who is somewhat modeled on John Nash's struggles with madness which were portrayed in "" A Beautiful Mind, "" is still the focal point of attention."
5978,"At first, Cry Wolf seems like it's going to be a traditional, straight - forward slasher movie, but soon you begin to realize that there are layers within layers, and the result is a movie that's increasingly suspenseful and intriguing from beginning to end. Most of the actors are talented unknowns, with a couple of established actors (Jon Bon Jovi, Anna Deavere Smith) artfully used (Bon Jovi in a major role, Smith in a minor one). Great production values, cinematography and editing--all elements contribute to a movie that's one of the best of its genre. cry_wolf is a classic rendition of the boy who cried wolf with a little twists and turns. some jumpy scenes, shocks, a little humor, fine women."
5979,"In the movie, Jonathan (Elijah Wood) obsessively collects items from his family, from toothbrushes to retainers to scraps of paper which he then seals in ziploc bags and pins to a wall in his house to record his family history. The screenplay effectively combines both humour and drama as the three characters travel through the countryside looking for Jonathan's grandfather's town, driving deeper and deeper into the memories of the past. The best performance probably comes from Eugene Hutz, playing Alex Jr., who starts the movie as a tracksuit - wearing, break dancing slacker just out to have fun but evolves into something more as not only Jonathan, but all the characters gain their own illumination. Liev Schreiber, Elijah Wood, and Eugene Hutz attended the screening and did a very humorous Q&A after the film: - Schreiber was very close to his grandfather, who was a Ukranian immigrant, and who died in 1993. - Foer and Schreiber talked about the film in the fall of 2001, shortly after the events of September 11."
5981,"The movie is comparable to a few episodes of the show strung together, but will be enjoyed whether you're a fan or not. Having seen hell, Stewie decides to be nice but it is not long before the faÃ§ade crumbles and instead he decides to spend his days drunk. Viewers will rightly feel that it could have been funnier or more consistent but with a handful of great moments and a scattering of good ones it is still worth a look. As usual, some of it falls flat--but the bits that work are funny enough to make this 80 - something minute of a "" movie "" worth watching. The funniest episodes ever of family guy have been based on interactions between Brian and Stewie, which MacFarlane delivers."
5984,"With extraordinary research, and some incredible interview contributors, the facts are again repeated - indeed, they gain, perhaps even greater impact because of the historical context - and the warnings of past leaders. This is coming from an individual who has enjoyed the bounties of capitalism, but got a wakeup call."
5986,"Remember, not every movie has to have some deep meaning or evoke emotion, some movies are just for fun. Nothing in this movie is worth the title "" DooM "", except for the props, the monsters and the weapons. Unlike ALIENS, Doom lacks a strong story and well - developed characters that the audience can cheer for. If your looking for a in depth rich story lined sci fi action combined film, go rent aliens. That's what this game needed - an objective for the marines to accomplish other than killing things."
5987,"Tony Scott's made a movie that appears to be something he and his friends could most enjoy while under the influence of substances of a dubious nature. One of the best scenes was in the "" deleted scenes "" section, the one where she's in the principle's office with her mom. Like any great painting the meaning in "" Domino "" is in the surface and the surface is everything. Trimming about 20 minutes would've made the story stronger and the narrative more fluent."
5988,"Those who have never worked a day of their lives in a restaurant may find this movie amusing, but they'll think it's too absurd to be real, and they'll probably never give a second thought to this movie ever again. This movie can get a tad immature at times, but those who love movies like "" The 40 - Year Old Virgin "" and "" Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle "" will absolutely worship this picture. He had been stuck with that eccentric ego in a lot of movies; but he does it perfectly and does another great job again. But those of you who have felt the pain, degradation, and humiliation of waiting tables will p ** s your pants laughing at how PERFECT this movie is. The always funny Ryan Reynolds leads the crew of misfits including Anna Faris, Justin Long and the incredibly hilarious Luiz Guzman."
5989,"Everything is completely laid out for you from the beginning. Sure, there are select scenes that you can equate between the movie and animation, character names are familiar, and even some of the technology, but for the most part this is a decent example of a film that was inspired by the work of Peter Chung's animation, and NOT a film based directly from it. The "" technology "" of the movie is rather unbelievable in some parts. But Aeon Flux turns out to be a solid B + grade SciFi flick that is inventive, stylistic, coherent and just plain fun to watch, particularly if you are partial to an athletic incarnation of Charlize Theron in Spandex. Get real - how lazy must you be if you lose interest because everything isn't explained immediately."
5990,"A comedy from the director of American Outlaws starring Samuel L. Jackson riffing on his Jules character from Pulp Fiction with the dad from American Pie can't be decent, can it? Surprisingly, this new fall comedy is actually humorous if not outright hilarious, and it is certainly better than it looks on paper or in the TV - spots. That's not to say the premise isn't pretty cookie - cutter: Andy Fidler, an innocent dental tools salesman (cue Eugene Levy) gets caught up in an illegal weapons plot and must deal with Special Agent Derrick Vann (Samuel L. Jackson playing what he plays best) and his crazy world. Vann and Andy happen to be polar opposites, as well. If this all sounds strangely like the average buddy comedy about the well - mannered white guy and the tough - as - nails black guy who don't get along at first but learn to appreciate each other and then become best friends, well, it pretty much is."
5991,"Some very interesting scenes that find ways to express things in subtle and creative ways without spelling them out. The courtroom setting added a lot of suspense to the story and horror movies always work best when there is suspense added to the spooky and creepy elements. Good movie and worth to own on DVD! While it's not terribly frightening, the film's juxtaposition of court room drama, and the exorcism scenes are intriguing. Her possession scenes are nothing short of incredible, the sheer torment she seems capable of portraying is utterly captivating."
5992,"All the "" best "" lines are spoken off screen by random extras that only exist in ADR. Flightplan is a psychological thriller that takes place almost entirely on an air - born jumbo jet en route to New York, from Berlin. Flightplan, while entertaining, remains among those psychological - thrill - rides that are only as successful as their audience is unsuccessful in knowing the truth during the course of the film. Peter Sarsgaard continues to put in one good performance after another and everyone from Sean Bean (who finally, FINALLY makes it to the end credits of a film without being killed!) Hitchcock fans will be delighted to know that German director Robert Schwentke has made a movie with a story just about as good as some of Hitchcock's - one that keeps them on the edge of their seats, and seems to keep the guessing game going until the end."
5993,"The songs in this movie are good and enjoyable. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter were fabulous voices, the music and songs were just right for the mood, and the story was actually quite different from The Nightmare before Christmas. The score goes very well to the movie and the four songs that are performed sound wonderful. They might not understand the story line that young, but they'll love the dancing skeletons and the fun songs! In the tradition of other excellent, animated features of recent years, The Corpse Bride will surely rank as one of the best."
5994,"HOOLIGANS as the title suggests depicts what these aforementioned films centre upon with the added value of having a story and characters you care about. The prospect of West Ham's cup tie with Millwall brings joy to the faces of both sets of fans. The acting is better than average, despite letting his cockney accent slip on occasions, Gang leader Charlie Hunnam shows a genuine mix of anger, aggression and compassion which holds the film together. This transition occurs within the often misunderstood culture of "" football hooligans "", hordes of zealous football fans who display a jingoistic allegiance to their teams and the locale from which they hail. The insight provided into this world reveals more than gang triviality for these men do not compete for the sake of criminal enterprise or the carnal spoils of women."
5995,"Viggo Mortensen's style of acting, judging by Lord of the Rings, Hidalgo, and this film, is to whisper when he's getting dramatic. Sure, there's some pretty detailed gore effects, but they're sporadic, random, and worst of all, not needed for anything. Viggo Mortensen proved he's one of the finest actors to come along in a long while. Cronenberg's adaptation of a Wagner and Locke graphic novel places a simple American family man, and his all - American family, into a new and disturbing context which has them questioning everything they think they know. Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) owns a little diner in a small town and has a nice house on the outskirts of town, where he and his wife Edie (Maria Bello) raise their two kids apparently living the American dream in their own way."
5996,"But if you look back at the history of movies, many of the best films are long. Because the acting, the settings, the costumes and everything else were excellent. Oliver and all the children play amazingly well, Fagin (an unrecognizable Ben Kinglsey _ and Sykes play their wickedness perfectly and their characters are very convincing. He definitely should have been nominated for Osacr in Best Supporting actor role. Never felt the movie was 2 hrs (+), as the movie drooled in an artistic yet visualistic way, as Dickens had written this masterpiece."
5997,"explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life. At that time, it was the game of upper class and rich "" gentlemen "", and working people could only participate by being caddies at country clubs. Against all odds, Francis Ouimet (played by Shia LaBeouf of "" Holes "") gets to compete against the greatest golfers of the U. S. and Great Britain at the 1913 U. S. Open. But despite these handicaps, Francis displays courage, spirit, heroism, and humility at this world class event. This adds to the inventory of great sports movies in the vein of "" Miracle "" and "" Remember the Titans . """
5998,"He drank and held court with the best of New York, which just also happened to be the nexus of television in the early 60s. Having read IN COLD BLOOD when it first came out, CAPOTE really captures on the screen the horror of what took place on that Kansas farm and the cinematography, costumes and locations are wonderful to behold. CAPOTE captures the essence of the 1950's, the horror of a brutal killing in the vast farmlands of Kansas, and delivers a knock out performance from Philip Seymour Hoffman. This is helped immensely by Philip Seymour Hoffmann's incredible performance as Capote, as well as solid acting from Catherine Keener, Clifton Collins Jr., and Chris Cooper. Watching the brilliant take of Philip Seymour Hoffman as Truman Capote on the screen, brought to mind another great actor, Meryl Streep, who like Mr. Hoffman is a chameleon in the interpretation of a character."
6000,"They changed the lyrics to One Winged Angel though, so you won't be able to sing along if you know the Carmina Burana Lyrics. The fights are fantastic and the magic is really cool! It's totally like a video - game in parts, with some amazing hand - to - hand combat in there. So: fantastic graphics and animation, great voice acting, cool video game styled music, involving story and characters, and maybe some of the coolest fights you'll see in a while. All your favorite characters are there, even Cait Sith."
6001,"The badguys are dealt with intelligently, and there are enough twists to convincingly carry the instability and danger of the situation. The beauty of the people in this simple adventure plot adds to the overall beauty of this film and is not a separate element as a lot of Jessica - Alba - in - bikini - blah - blah suggests. The underwater cinematography was amazing - totally worth the matinÃ©e price and cheaper than diving - the kind of film you need the bigscreen to enjoy. The film has some neat underwater photography, some good stunts, and even a twist or two. see if you can hold your breath as long as these people do in some of these scenes."
6009,"The result is an enjoyably entertaining comedy / drama featuring a number of topflight performances and some hilarious dialogue. (Maggie's obsession with Rose's sexy heels recalls an ongoing theme of television's Sex and the City.) Curtis Hanson (L. A. Confidential, Wonder Boys) has struck gold with Susannah Grant's (Erin Brokovich) adaptation of the best seller by Jennifer Weiner. The film is really about the secrets and lies that cripple a family over time and how a strange course of events revisit the relationships or lack thereof. Hanson and the company do a marvelous job of balancing some very funny dialogue with more serious, dramatic scenes."
6002,"There's a real character in there who loves his wife and kids and the movie does its best to portray him as fairly as possible despite his drinking problem and fits of rage. The movie does bring out strong emotions from its audience, not quite a tear - jerker but close. It's not perfect, but it's a really lovely movie nevertheless and deserves to be better known - certainly by Oscar voters who otherwise might give it a miss. Lets get this movie out in full circulation so others can appreciate this excellent show. Women across the country used their wit and wordplay to win thousands of dollars by writing slogans for companies to promote their products."
6003,"Well, it's true that the story does wear its influences on its sleeve--a little "" Alice in Wonderland "" here, a little "" Time Bandits "" there, a lot of "" Wizard of Oz "" over here, not to mention a resemblance to Gaiman's own "" Coraline . "" Dave McKean and Neil Gaiman's MirrorMask is the quintessential Alice in Wonderland story. The world that these two immensely gifted artists and storytellers have created is the very definition of mind - blowing, offering up one of the most astonishing and original fantasy realms since Marc Caro and Jean - Pierre Jeunet's The City of Lost Children over a decade ago. The amazing dreamscapes of Helena is truly Dave McKean's art brought to life, and is just through and through a perfect fit for Neil Gaiman's highly imaginative and at times quirky style of writing. Gina McKee delivers an equally impressive performance as Helena's mother, Joanne, and as the Dark Queen she has such a stunning presence about her that not even the most wicked of witches or evil of step - mothers could overshadow her for even the fraction of a second."
6004,"It keeps the charm and wit of the three W+G shorts and it is enlarged with many references to these and other movies. So, the new "" Wallace and Gromit "" - movie is enjoyed best if you watched (and liked) the shorts already, yet it also works on its own. Instead, this new Aardman masterpiece keeps that crazier and somehow more "" isolated "" feeling of the W+G shorts. Children should also enjoy it very much, especially because of the sweet rabbits (if you love cute bunnies, this is a must - see for you!) and because Gromit has a lot do to and really steals the show (children also love dogs."
6005,"All however, are larger than life, exhibit great chemistry and for a movie buff, it is heaven to witness the self referential exercises and hear the narrator shred every narrating convention applicable. His one - liners and connected sub-plots are not typical and Kilmer and Downey make magic with their banter and clinical delivery. Even the clichÃ©s are clever e. g. a tough guy predictably crashes through a glass table, or body after body turns up, to haunt the characters. One of the year's best films and one of those rare movies where you'll consistently find something new to laugh at, when viewed each of a dozen times. Yes, a buddy - movie, film - noir, murder mystery, crime - thriller, all rolled into one hip modern self - referential update, packed with amusing references to all the clichÃ©s of the genres depicted."
6006,"Just enjoy his unique songs and magical voice. Dylan's songs are collections of beautiful phrases and words. Well, it took a director as great as Martin Scorsese and 45 years of recording, travelling, ramblin' and bein' busy bein' born instead of dyin', but at long last Dylan fans from Dharma to Duluth have a glimpse behind the genius in the dark sunglasses. And that is why Scorsese must be applauded; the editing was superb, the interviews were well chosen, the music clips were generous and Dylan is wonderfully articulate and revealing. The interviews were fascinating, humorous and sometimes truly educational."
6010,"See it for the performances of Linney and especially Daniels, who has been proving his versatility as an actor over the last few years. Also big props to all the actors for fine performances. Other outstanding performances include William Baldwin (the one from "" Backdraft ""), Holly Feifer (as Eisenberg's first girlfriend) and Anna Paquin (underused, but still very effective). Baumbach Jr., on the other hand, is a great filmmaker, and his movies (The Life Aquatic) are seen by millions. It was believable, well shot, great backgrounds, all in all a treat for anyone who loves movies and can handle some pretty raw dialog / situations."
6011,"The film does have some entertaining moments and the first half of the movie is actually pretty exciting to watch. Matthew McConaughey is a light weight actor who, aside from his good looks, doesn't bring anything to this story. But McConaughey and Pacino deliver enough laughs and energy to make this more accessible to those with little knowledge of the subject matter. Having found a new rising star, Brandon Lang, a man that knows a lot about the intricacies of point spreads and picking winners. Hell, this movie is worth seeing for the topless McConaughey shots alone."
6012,"His wife Anne (Emily Watson), who is twenty years younger than her husband, is more emotional, more impulsive, and more prone to drama. But the real point is the ethical dilemmas of telling lies at different levels that the film probes. It is a film whose effect relies on the cast portraying the varyingly benign / malignant characters and it is here that Fellowes' directorial choices are superb. The story has a linear line that is easy to follow, but the beauty of the film is the metamorphosis of each player as a single incident ignites a minefield of disasters."
6013,"Although it's a comedy, the movie takes itself seriously and doesn't take easy shortcuts in doing so with style. If you are a fan of Star Trek, Babylon 5, etc you have probably also thought of some scenes you would like to see. There are great build - up's, the pacing works out pretty good and the space scenes don't overshadow the storytelling. The sets you have been shooting the movie, hehe living rooms, nice. Acting was good, as most of the actors were amateurs, except for one."
6014,""" A gay western "" "" Heath and Jake's hot scenes "" As soon as the film started every imaginable preconception flew out of the auditorium. - The film will be enjoyed much more allowing the story to unfold without having passages underlined and attention drawn to this or that particular. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal give equally moving and accomplished performances, although the story tends to focus more on Ledger's character. Regardless of whether or not he wins the Oscar, his performance in this movie will be watched and admired for years to come as a landmark in acting. This is one of those movies where you find that you fully appreciate both performances of the two men, Heath and Jake, equally, but perhaps one before the other over time."
6015,"Susan Sarandon was perfect, Alec Baldwin was hilarious, the Elizabethtown residents were quirky and fun. Many people will recoil at this film - like a symphony, it has many movements and complex orchestrations and certainly it isn't without flaws (lengthy running time, Sarandon's tap dance finale) but when it's all said and done ELIZABETHTOWN is a warm, endearing and romantic celebration of life and love. There are some really entertaining moments including Drew's cousin's rock band playing "" Free Bird "" and Susan Sarandon tap dancing to "" Moon River . "" Basic storyline, Drew Baylor has to go to Elizabethtown, Kentucky from his home in Oregon to plan the funeral of his father and meets an interesting young woman, Claire, who helps him feel like he can live again. You can tell from the brief flashbacks and other clues that Drew's father Mitch was really a great guy, and Drew comes to regret the fact that he had not spent much time with his Dad in his eight years as a Corporate Superstar."
6016,"In real life, character complexity of those who oppress or who defend oppressors is part of what makes the problem of sexual harassment difficult to fight. Credit practically the entire cast for the former, and director Niki Caro and cinematography of Chris Menges for the latter, but the overall tone of this movie is 1) very familiar stuff tot the point of reeking of "" TV Movie "" material, 2) manipulative by a mile, 3) hits on each emotional note--from the sort of "" Girl POwer "" quiet assertions of the film's script to the overt nastiness displayed by nearly all of the males working the mines--almost in a perfect cue; 4) the fictionalizing the stories, then mixing the time - lines from the actual case the movie and the book it was based on (namely, Jenson v. Eleveth Mines, filed in 1984, settled in 1998; whereas the film is set in 1989 and almost instantly flips to Septemeber 1991, circa the Anita Hill / Clarence THomas hearings, with the events - to - case trial time relationship murky at best); and 5) the sort of "" feel good "" third act denouement where the town, once boorishly stubborn against the idea of women working in the mines to being stirred by Ms. Aimes' case. Presenting a fictional account of the nonfiction book Class Action: The Story of Lois Jensen and the Landmark Case that Changed Sexual Harassment Law, North Country begins on the stand with Josey Aimes (Charlize Theron) being grilled about her sex life. It's worth noting that the missteps happen where the film strays farthest from the true story, the Michael Seitzman coming through maybe. Charlize Theron deserves all the recognition she got for giving a strong, confidant and heartfelt performance as the brave hard - working and headstrong Josey Aimes."
6017,"The inter-cutting between Murrow / Strathairn and the real Senator McCarthy creates the perfect illusion of a startling reality. Then there is Ray Wise as the vulnerable Don Hollenbeck, who was one of the co-creators of "" You Are There "", a program this film somewhat resembles. In fact, the sharpest contrast drawn between today and back then is the intelligence and the literacy, the erudition and the commitment to the tenets of good journalism of Edward R. Murrow and his crew. Actor / Director George Clooney pays tribute to truth and decency amid distrust and uncertainty in the Communist witchhunts with his recreation of its greatest hero, the newsman of newsmen, Edward R. Murrow, in Good Night, and Good Luck. Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) was the grand master of the news airwaves in the infantile medium of television."
6018,"It's a movie for all ages, and if it comes out on DVD before Christmas, it'll make a wonderful gift. The exciting project, F. I. L. M. (an acronym for "" Finding Inspiration in Movies and Literature "") includes a three step process in which children screen select films, use activity guides for each film, and then partake in service learning projects. Mariah's Storm is 14 years old now and is still having babies. All in all this film is a winner (no puns intended) and great for people of all ages (and genders). All the actors and actresses did such a great job in this movie."
6019,"Directed by Brisbanite John Hillcoate from a script by Aussie indie icon Nick Cave, this film has some of the most gorgeous photography of the Australian outback ever committed to film, showcasing it's unique desolate beauty in it's dust, flies and exquisite sunsets. Hillcoate assembles a very fine ensemble cast, most notably Ray Winstone as Captain Stanley and Guy Pearce as Charlie Burns - two actors performing at the top of their game. Other performers include Emily Watson and John Hurt, as well as fine Australian talent David Wenham, Leah Purcell, Tommy Lewis and quintessential movie aborigine David Gulpilil. There are no obvious good guys and bad guys, all the characters are shades of grey possessing both positive and negative attributes, although some characters may lean one way or the other. In particular, Captain Stanley has a good heart though history may judge his methods of justice with contempt, and Charlie Burns has a fierce sense of loyalty and honour but his associated family ties have led him to commit horrific crimes."
6021,"In particular, series regulars Brad Johnson and Janaya Stephens both turn in great performances. Chloe and Bruce get sick off infected Bibles, which brings about the end of Pastor Barnes, which many of you will remember from the book series. At the helm this time is director Craig R. Baxley, whose previous work makes it no surprise that directing movies with suspense, apocalyptic themes, and action should come naturally to him. Anway, the previous two movies were passable, but nowhere near the quality of the books they were based on. This is going to be hard to follow up as it was indeed the best of all three movies."
6022,"It was a quiet and quaint film that delivered an absorbing story without explosions or over drawn out comedic moments. The story (based on a novella by Steve Martin) concerns well, a shopgirl at Saks Fifth Avenue named Mirabelle (played wonderfully by Claire Danes). Fresh from Vermont and trying to make it as an artist in the hustle and bustle that is Los Angeles, Mirabelle in the span of just a few days goes from someone of plain existence that the world seems to have ignored to being the apple in the eyes of two suitors that couldn't be more different from each other. Porter is loaded and in his courtship of Mirabelle he is able to lavish her with gifts beyond her accepted imagination. This bittersweet story comes alive because of Claire Danes great performance as Mirabelle."
6023,"It's really easy to relate to problems kids face, and this movie will make it even easier for kids to understand. When you're telling a story (even for teens) and there's a higher message, you don't have to explain every single part of it, stick with what you want to tell not what you mean. Another important point about a good movie (with a "" higher message "") is the following: either you're telling something that most people won't agree with and through the characters they'll change their minds or the topics are really common and there's the context which makes it interesting. The writer of the film put parts in it that are really true. It's one of those films that has some low budget problems but the film's heart is so in the right place you easily over look them."
6024,"Overall, if you like the looks of the film / story / trailer / or even cover, it certainly delivers, and you will love it. Not perfect, but a wild ride about manipulation, consequences, fame, and sex. Mychael Danna's scores for Exotica and The Sweet Hereafter were brilliant; this one's a flop. That character should exude intelligence other than sensual vibes. Hugely entertaining film + Bad critics + Tasteful love scenes."
6026,"For the best experience, pay attention to the little details, but don't try to figure anything out until the end. See it with someone so that you can discuss it afterward. The opening of the film is a twisted visual experience that has to do with a car crashing on a bridge, fire, and a body - all given during the opening credits. The script is clumsy, the camera work is distractingly of kilter, little gimmicks are used to the extreme, and the tiny roles of supporting characters hardly merit the gifted actors such as Hoskins, Burton, and Garofalo. Because despite all the defects it does engage the mind and forces the viewer to set aside the general principles of understanding and just release the mind to a crazy ride."
6027,"Strengths of the movie include admirable performing by the Alejandro and Elena stars. However, the fight scenes are still pretty good and there are a lot of entertaining scenes like the train scene at the end. However, if you want something in the vein of National Treasure, a safe family action film, then this sequel is for you and it can really be enjoyed by adults too. Thankfully LOZ has 2 out of the 3 (no Anthony Hopkins for obvious reasons) and while the film has clearly been dumbed down and made more "" family friendly "" as with all mainstream Hollywood sequels, it still has Banderas and Zeta Jones clearly having fun with it. At the end of the day fans of the original Zorro film will probably enjoy this, as long as they don't expect it to be anything other than a fun popcorn sequel."
6028,"The results of these attempts range from very funny to downright saddening, and this helps lend the film an air of realism. This is a complicated character study about a man coming to grips with the fact that he's failed to meet any of the goals he set for himself in life, despite attaining a social standing that many people are envious of. While not for all tastes, this movie deserves credit for tackling a relatively conventional subject in a very unconventional, at least for a mainstream Hollywood movie, manner. Likewise Hope Davis is fine as are the cameo roles of the children as sensitively played by de la PeÃ±a and Hoult. Although still very good at presenting issues normally not seen on film, director Gore Verbinski ("" Pirates of the Caribbean "" "" The Ring "") falls just short of making a very powerful statement."
6029,"The mark of a great thriller / shocker / horror movie is the number of twists and turns, and this is what identifies Saw II as one of the better members of its genre. the ending had so many twists, it was just brilliant. Not that the first one was worth anything more than one viewing ever, but at least it did achieve the whole "" twist "" ending and was an enjoyable one at that. it was so great because of his voice, his appearance, everything."
6031,"Thankfully its actually pretty good, Tad Hilgenbrinck (Matt Stifler) pulls off an incredible performance as the Stifmeister's younger brother; its like Steve Stiflers back (really he's that good) Matt Stifler is assigned to band camp, as punishment (revenge) by the Sherminator and that's where the trouble starts, more antic's involving instruments, cameras and Jim's dad follow and with plenty of laughs' American Pie presents Band Camp' comes out with at least some credibility as a part of the American Pie Series. It's not some great masterpiece of cinematography, of course, but the actors are acting well, the script, even it is as clichÃ© as they get, it well written and the lead character makes a great Stifler act. So naturally he pulls more pranks on the rivals like, two. Add a last fifteen minutes that's like the Siberian prison edit of "" Family Matters "" and you start wondering why it's still somewhat enjoyable. The charm and the success of the previous 3 American Pie movies were its characters."
6034,"Manderlay 9/10 Introducing this' Part 2' of the von Trier American Trilogy, actor Danny Glover said, Â¨ The process of storytelling is an enormous responsibility and opportunity. Both with his Dogme movement films and now with later works such as Dancer in the Dark, Dogville and Manderlay, his answer seems to be firmly towards art as a worthy end in itself â€“ or at least as a serious medium by which to raise (though not answer) questions of social conscience. With a pure heart, god intentions, and the power of her father's lawyer and henchmen behind her, Grace makes well - meaning but unfortunate, ill - informed attempts to put things right. Manderlay's high points are that it is deeply philosophical but at the same time highly coherent and accessible. The weakness of Manderlay is that the USA (and its internal and foreign policy) is an ideal example for any artist tackling such issues â€“ as it's visibility provides a common focus throughout the world."
6035,"Just because Guy made a name for himself with funny, cheeky cockney romps, doesn't mean he can't be deep without being "" pretentious "". As might be expected from Luc Besson's name on the credits as producer, there's a definite element of' Cinema de look' about it: set in a kind of realistic fantasy world where America and Britain overlap, it looks great, has a couple of superbly edited and conceived action sequences and oozes style, all of which mark it up as a disposable entertainment. Rather than a commercial for Kabbalism, it's really more a mixture of the overlapping principles of commerce, chess and confidence trickery that for the most part pulls off the difficult trick of making the theosophy accessible while hiding the film's central (somewhat metaphysical) con. Yes this has its influences from modern classics (fight club, pulp fiction etc) but it is in the whole original in both direction and pacing with a music score second to none. or "" Snatch "", in the sense that it isn't that funny (in fact, it's pretty dark), and it is a lot more intelligent, in the way that you see parts of scenes from different viewpoints (and, in one of the best scenes of the film, Jason Statham spends five minutes in a lift having an argument with himself)."
6037,"This film is not just a War film, it is able to seamlessly mix comedy and drama, with such issues as Mental health and even a bit of ennui. The characters are fully developed, each and everyone has an interesting story that is covered, briefly but perfectly. "" Every war is different, "" says Anthony Swofford as the movie "" Jarhead "" comes to a close. Excerpt: Their reviews seemed to be positive, especially concerning the portrayal of the relationship between Marines and how deployments and war are mostly about sitting around and waiting. Jake Gyllenhaal gives an excellent performance as Anthony Swofford, complemented by the able talents of Jamie Foxx and Peter Sarsgaard."
6040,"A story of harsh truths as well as transcendent art, it finds humanity and hope in the midst of battlefield horrors. But a miracle happens: among the Germans is a famous opera tenor Nikolaus Sprink (Benno FÃ¼rmann) who has aligned with his fellow troops in the trenches, hoping he can bring some minor sense of Christmas and understanding to them. WW1 drama Joyeux Noel arrives under a big black wintry cloud, having been selected to represent France in the Best Foreign Language Film category over the much - hyped March of the Penguins at the 2006 Oscars. Christmas Eve comes and the voice of Sprink (in reality the tenor Rolando VillazÃ³n) sings' Stille Nacht', rising out of the trenches to sing in the open of no man's land. That goes for even relatively smaller roles: for example, that of the junior German officer at the front, Lieutenant Horstmayer (ironically a Jew who recalls a Paris honeymoon with his French - speaking wife), as played by the superb young actor Daniel BrÃ¼hl (Goodbye Lenin, The Edukators)."
6041,"The downfall of this film is it's over dramatized scenes, and it may be a little to long, however, a good critique of Black Urban society, and well worth your 8 dollars. And to make one last comparison, this film way out did anything 8 Mile attempted (much more of a social critique). The other performances are solid, including Curtis "" 50 Cent "" Jackson who, for people who don't seem to understand this, plays himself. In fact, 50 - very much like the legions of other gangster rappers - possesses great talent: the talent of a virtuoso con artist. The best and most powerful scene in this film is when someone slips a razor blade in his solitary cell in order for him to kill himself."
6042,"The best thing is that the laughs come from hilarious situations that you could explain to your parents without feeling uncomfortable. The slap - fights were great and the one moment of brotherly love was simply hilarious. If you like romantic comedies (no this is not a chick flick) then this will be perfect for you! Chris's younger brother also does a nice performance of making sure his older brother Chris is well informed that he is a loser that can't "" boink "" the girl of his dreams while trying to get - it - on with Sam (the crazy girl played by Anna Farris) Either way, this movie appeals to all in need of a good laugh this holiday season. If you're tired of the raunchy humor of the likes of 40 - Year Old Virgin and want a good movie for a date or just as a stand alone movie, this one is great."
6043,"And these only partially successful performances and outright failures are where "" Syriana "" fails--as a film. Syriana, starring Matt Damon and George Clooney, reveals a possible honesty in foreign political corruption. America (read American business) has a vested interest in which of the king's sons succeeds him to the throne: It doesn't want the reform - minded eldest son, whose priorities will be building a country to benefit his own people; it wants instead the younger son, who will continue to relegate his country to a cosy spot in America's hip pocket and take its orders directly from the president of the USA. And although the movie takes the viewer through a roller - coaster of different lives and people objectives at the beginning of the film, the movie ties in brilliantly to connect not only the characters lives, but the lives of the audience and everyone's lives who have capitalistic motives. Stephen Gaghan shows he can do well working with Mr. Baer's material and made an interesting film that while it will irritate some viewers, on the whole he had the right idea in the way to tell this story."
6045,"Another great addition is the priceless Donald Sutherland who, in a perfect world, would have had more scenes with Judy Densch. Darcys embodied by Olivier, Firth and now Matthew McFadyen bring differently significance to enjoy in the proud and socially awkward leading male role. Similarly Garson, Ehle and Keira Knightley illustrate the lively intelligence, sharp - minded wit and wry humour of Elizabeth Bennet in equally shining ways that nevertheless bring out different aspects of the character. Keira Knightly's performance as Elizabeth Bennett is by far her best, as she sparkles in this role. the love story is heart - felt and sweetly, deeply affecting to a level that modern romantic comedies rarely achieve."
6046,"McLean has an eye for the unsettling, even in the mostly warm first minutes, and he uses the stark colors and landscapes of the deepening outback to give it a slowly building sense of dread."
6047,"All the horror techniques are used here, there are enough jumps (both telegraphed and not) that every pause will have you ready to flinch, but there's also fantastic use of suspense and everything about the film oozes menace and foreboding. Have fun spotting references to Carrie and Apocalypse Now by all means, but don't be fooled into thinking this is a mere standard entry into the much saturated genre - movie staple. Sounds simple but the direction is top notch, good performances from all involved and it somehow manages to dodge most current horror / thriller clichÃ©s to deliver a well paced film, filled with enough jump inducing moments to even give this harden horror buff a few scares! There are comparisons to be drawn to Marshall's' Soldiers of course - again the story is stark and wonderfully economic. All the performances are strong throughout."
6048,"Light romance was touched upon yet wasn't over-emphasised and the Yule Ball will please those who enjoyed the scenes in the book but audience members over the age of sixteen might find teens ogling each other a tad dull (Hermione is very out - of - character and the scene does drag). Alan Rickman's Snape may only have had four or so scenes but he definitely made his presences known while Maggie Smith really captured the essence of McGonagall. The Phelp twins have also improved dramatically. Truly, It has some wonderful scenes which seem like they've been plucked from your imagination. There are many funny scenes as well as scenes that can only be described as' cute' involving him."
6050,"The chemistry of Phoenix and Witherspoon together in any scene, but their on - stage duets in particular, are truthful in a way that resonates long after the credits. Usually you look closely at the fine print and see that the esteemed critic lauding the film is Joe Schmoe from the One Stop Light Bugle Press in Buttcreek, Illinois or a low level flunky who just happens to work for the media conglomerate that is distributing the film. But what is great is that T Bone Burnett chose the right songs to play. If Phoenix and Witherspoon are not nominated for their amazing voices and chilling performances, it will be a great disappointment. And what is great, is that Pheonix and Witherspoon sand the songs themselves."
6052,"Jonah Bobo and Josh Hutcherson work extremely well together as the two lead characters and with special effects that are realistic (as realistic as a fantasy film can get anyway) the end result is an excellent movie for all ages. Up against a lot of the uninspired sh*t that is released these days, Zathura is very successful in creating a fun and visually convincing escape. What elevates this film is the believable interactions of the two young players. The house and Zathura game - board were both characters in and of themselves, every bit as important as the actors (who did a fine job). To play is simple, wind it up, push a button and watch a number come up, this determines the number of spaces your playing piece will take."
6053,"Silverman forces audiences to confront their own gut reactions about unacceptable ideas without providing anyone easy to blame. She is a polite, educated, attractive young woman."
6054,"And when one thinks of Harold Ramis, they think of his ingenious work as a director of comedies. Connie Nielsen is a classic femme fatal in the 1940s style. Randy Quaid does his usual best as Kansas City mobster Bill Guerarrd. And bit player Ned Bellamy, cast as a strip club bouncer with Mom issues adds some fine scenes. John Cusak and Billy Bob Thorton are perfect together."
6064,"All is well until Julian realizes his "" meltdown "" is serious and he is having difficulty following through on his "" assignments . "" Pierce Brosnan is at his best and most hilarious in Richard Sherpherd's The Matador (2005), as a booze - drenched over the hill hit - man who loves bullfights, tacky clothes and teenage girls. Newbie filmmaker Richard Shepard makes a solid big screen debut with a pointedly wicked black comedy with a sharp eye for visual detail and nuanced dialogue and character development that makes him a talent to watch in this breath - of - fresh - air into the' buddy comedy' formula skewering what is anticipated of his leads and allowing Brosnan to get his ya - yas out with devilish glee. If you go, expect punch lines and sight gags regarding all types of sex, killing, religion, sports, business and anything else you might deem politically incorrect. This tremendously entertaining film grabs you from the opening scene and never stops delivering laughs, surprises and unexpectedly touching moments."
6056,"Allen uses a lot of very close - in face shots, and his cast handles it with ease, performing their parts with accuracy and no lack of passion. Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Emily Mortimer, and Scarlett Johanssen are all excellent, and the rest of the cast lends excellent support. In "" Match Point, "" Woody Allen, caught in one of his more "" serious "" moods, takes a simple tale about marital infidelity and turns it into something complex and fascinating. The cast is excellent but the supporting cast outshines the leads somehow. MATCH POINT is easily his best film since CRIMES AND MISDEMEANOURS and once of his best ever."
6057,"The feelings of the two leading characters are carefully explained and brought to you very realistically by an outstanding performance of Ali Suliman and Kais Nashef. The two young leads, Kais Nashef and Ali Suliman are perfect in their roles. Their election to be martyrs for the destruction of the' invaders' is considered an honor: their deaths will bring glory to their country, their families, and guarantee them instant entry into heaven."
6058,"The beautiful cinematography and the terrific performances of the children make this film outstanding for family viewing. The movie pulls the viewer into the story right from the opening scenes of war - ravaged England, where siblings Lucy, Susan, Peter and Edmund (wonderful performances by all) are sent from their homes to the relative safety of' the professor' s' country estate where, during a game of hide - and - go - seek, young Lucy hides in the wardrobe only to discover the passage to the land of Narnia. By the way, make sure you stay through the end credits to hear a beautiful song Alanis Morisette wrote especially for the film. The acting / voices were all wonderful, including the young talent. This film succeeds on so many levels, it would be possible to discuss it in many different veins: the direction, the story's surface - level themes, the theological possibilities, the drama, the fantasy, the adventure."
6059,"A real Orson Welles type, the guy just loves making movies--and money--so much he'll go to insane lengths to make his project a reality, whether it involves outrunning his creditors, shanghaiing Driscoll on the Venture, or tricking his cast and crew onto uncharted Skull Island. But after the enormous success of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, it would seem that the general public has learned to trust director Peter Jackson. The cast is pitch perfect, right down to the most minuscule parts. You had a $200 million budget, special effects wizards up the wazoo and Peter "" LOTR "" Jackson directing a bona fide classic that could only benefit from a modern retelling. The sunrise and sunset scenes were quite nice."
6060,"Its also about a lifelong search for love in a society in which people apparently can't just step up and make frank declarations of devotion to one another. The supporting males, while obviously not as well developed since they spend less time in the geisha quarters, still give incredible performances. The performances are outstanding, everything about the physical setting and cinematography is breathtaking, and it's emotionally rich without feeling twee or sentimental. "" Memoirs of a Geisha "" is a love story that remains tedious and distant from being an epic love story on scale with Casabalanca, Dr. Zhivago, or even Titanic"
6061,"The various Stones--Diane Keaton, Craig T. Nelson, Dermot Mulroney, Rachel McAdams, Luke Wilson--make the most of their roles, and, more importantly, they really do start to seem like a family, not a random collection of actors. Dermot Mulroney, Rachel McAdams (the best thing in Wes Craven's' Red Eye'), Luke Wilson (a much better actor than brother Owen) and Diane Keaton also give fine turns, and Craig T. Nelson - another much underrated character actor â€“ is perfectly cast Keaton's husband."
6065,"The "" Three burials of Melquiades Estrada "" is a multi-layered story of death, retribution, loneliness, and remembrance. This journey will bring forward the stark contrast between the values of two ways of life and the landscape transversed is both geographical and emotional. Concomitantly the values of the old west, based on friendship, loyalty and commitment have ebbed, though they are still existent as embodied by the relationship of Pete with his best friend. All the performances are top notch in their expressive minimalism, greatly contributing to the lasting emotional impact of this outstanding film. He has made some really great performances in the movies JFK, Heaven & Earth, and The Fugitive."
6067,"Every character is different, and though common in their desire for vengeance, their temperaments are clearly distinguishable in the way the hit men approach their task. There are neighbors, bystanders and obstacles that must be avoided and protected - with variable success. Perspectives and convictions can change, sometimes regrettably. Carl has his doubts about Avner, telling him that he was chosen because he is a "" good soldier "". Anyone paying attention to world reaction to Guantanimo, Abu Gharib, the bombing of Afghan and Iraqi villages and the spiriting away of suspected terrorists through "" rendition "" for torture in "" friendly "" nations must be aware that whether one leans hard or soft on such matters, there is going to be a price to be paid."
6068,"So here is another tipsy triumph of the master, beautifully realized and sung and danced by this splendid cast of multi-talented actors and actresses. Based on the 1968 film starring Zero Maestel and Gene Wilder, and the smash hit on Broadway, the story of a failing Producer named Max Bialystock who has just had the worst show in town close called Funny Boy, a musical version of Hamlet. Will Ferrell scores laughs as Nazi playwright Franz Liebkind, and Uma Thurman puts in a good song and dance as Swedish sexpot Ulla. So much fun and very deserving of the name Mel Brooks this film is great for the holidays (with the more adult jokes being concealed in song, and only minor swearing) older children and teenagers should get a kick out of this fast paced, fun, and very memorable film. You know, the Bugsby Berkley years, big and flashy with hum able songs."
6069,"The scenes with Aniston and Ruffalo were much better and seemed more real. The situational comedy is very much in keeping with an extended version of a comfortable television show, even with the star power of MacLaine and Costner backing Anniston up. The appeal between Costner and Aniston seemed force and there was nothing interesting about it at all. Lots of twists and turns in the film have the characters racing up and down the coast of California in search of the past, the future, and the truth, which ends up being both expected and unexpected in this complicated but easily - followed plot. Their scenes in the beginning are quite fun to watch."
6070,"Like the first film, this installment relies on Martin's physical comedy for laughs with some very relatable moments along the way and in the end, the family wins out over all other forces. There are some nice moments in the movie about family values and the ending is pretty nice. It picks up a couple years after the first installment with changes abound as the oldest daughter is now married and pregnant and with everyone growing up, the Bakers plan to vacation one last time at their old summer nesting grounds before sending off newly graduated Lurraine (Hillary Duff) to New York. Joining the original cast is a new set of players including American PIE regular Eugene Levy, parody - movie regular Carmen Electra and another batch of kids and teens. Cheaper by the Dozen II, like most sequels, wasn't as good as its predecessor but was a safe movie bet, allowing you to fall back into a familiarity of the first and have some more fun with it."
6071,"TeÃ  Leoni, while at times was a bit hard to swallow made a good match for her high energy movie spouse, Jim Carrey. She was able to come up to Carrey's intensity with her constant anxious energy, yet throughout most of the movie he out shined her as he does most of his movie co-stars. Tea Leoni is a good match for him because she too can be sexy while doing pratfalls or ending up with mud on her face. This is a dream coupling that should be repeated in more light comedies the way William Powell & Myrna Loy were paired in The Thin Man series. They became that fun couple you always invite to your get - togethers because they are the life of every party."
6072,"The athletes are always, ALWAYS treated with the utmost respect. Unlike most movies about the mentally handicapped, there are major parts in this movie played by genuine special Olympic athletes, and they used some 200 special Olympic extra's. This was a labor of love, on both sides of the camera. A goof - ball with a heart of gold is helped by a group of S. O. athletes, only to overcome odds, help a friend get his fingers back, and open himself up to vulnerability and attacks. Excellent performances by Knoxville, Heigl, and especially Jed Rees and Bill Chott for their unforgettable performances as Glen and Thomas (both from Galaxy Quest)."
6074,"This great black comedy in the British tradition appeals to all generations. The other well knows actors all ham it up beautifully and the Isle of Man looks wonderful and, like the film, twenty years out of date. You really must see this movie - it is a gem - if you know people who don't normally go to the movies (like older in - laws) urge them to see this one, or at least rent the DVD. It also has a lot of very deep things to say about marriage and religion (Atkinson plays a shy, self - absorbed country vicar with a beautiful wife and daughter whom he neglects) without indulging in the usual superficial post-modern ironic attacks on either institution. All the main players are perfect for their characters."
6076,"' The New World' is a film that will draw out one of two very powerful emotions: Love or Hate. Perhaps, but they are the film's two most brilliant qualities. It is so rich and textured that it would be hard to say where things could have been improved, but aside from the first forty minutes which deal largely with the question of whether or not the Europeans can survive the first winter or not, the dramatic' action,' that is, the engine of a script that pushes one scene into the next, is idling at best. Thought number two is that although the film is equal parts challenging and rewarding (as great movies should be) it is especially important in the case of' The New World' to see it in the theatre. NOTHING this year, NOTHING has come close to being a threat to' The New World' for either of those two categories."
6077,"The film fuses the relatively low - key style of "" Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance "" with the jet - black humor of "" Oldboy, "" while adding welcome moments of poignancy and sentiment. Suffice it to say that the climax blends tragedy and hilarity with a degree of success that few directors could hope to match. Film opens with the release of Lady Vengeance, a. k. a. "" The Witch "", a. k. a. "" kind - hearted Geum - ja "", played by the elegant Yeong - ae Lee. Making comparisons with Park's past two films was much tangible here as with each beautiful classical piece mirroring one from Oldboy there was also the unexaggerated violence similar to that of SFMV. The music was again well chosen and played in melancholic and elating waves without any use of mainstream ballads or electronic beats."
6081,"The opening credits take place over a nice little montage of paintings, then moves to a sunset in the mountains effectively establishing the mood in a surprisingly competent fashion. Another classic example of the difference between Boll and Wood, perfectly illustrated by BloodRayne, is that Wood's films made narrative sense."
6082,"He's more interested in scenes and ideas that move the story forward. One of the aspects of this film that made it so powerful was how Roth created a sense of helpless and inevitability. Another great element in the script is how the' survivor' makes moral choices that define their character. If you know Slovakia, you know that this movie was filming in Czech Republic (there is a lot of signs with czech language on it, also the language they speak is czech), which is lovely country with beautiful history. The film is wonderfully lit, specifically in the torture chamber - scenes."
6087,"Once you get absorbed in the world of Hoodwinked, you stop comparing it to Pixar and simply enjoy the magic little world the creators obviously put so much care into creating. All in all, worth the trip to the theater, and worth buying the DVD. Plus their were clever references and homages sprinkled throughout which the any intelligent moviegoer will appreciate."
6089,"Jokes about Halloween "" Ghandi "", explosives training, stoning rituals, Jews and corporate outsourcing all delivered in pure Brooksian style contribute to a very smart and clever film that Brooks aficionados will appreciate very much. This movie is a good example, also, of how to make political critiques without shrieking at your audience. That said, his new film, "" Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World "", offers an unforgettable trip to some exotic locations in search of laughter, which is something Mr. Brooks does best."
6092,"Good films depict feelings truthfully; with great works of art, you experience emotions deep within yourself. Takata's journey to China's Yunnan province to complete his son's filming of the legendary song "" Qian li zou dan qi, "" that gave the film its title, is full of twists and turns. Zhang, a master of producing a variety of genres and styles, put everything into this work (except the wushu grandeur of "" Hero "" and the upcoming "" Curse of the Golden Flower "") - the broad sweep of "" Raise the Red Lantern, "" the chamber music of "" The Road Home, "" the joyful melodrama of "" Happy Times, "" and a dozen other works. "" Riding Alone "" is adventure, psychological drama, a "" quest film, "" unveiling spectacular vistas and the deep divisions / underlying connections between individuals and civilizations. If the film were presented in a series of silent close - ups of Takakura, it would be glorious enough, but the bonus is an army of non-professional actors, in addition to the magnificent Shinobu Terajima as Takata's daughter - in - law; Qiu Lin as Lingo, the would - be interpreter; Jiang Wen as Jasmine, the accomplished translator; Yang Zhenbo as Yang Yang, an amazing child star in a pivotal role; and Chinese - opera star Li Jiamin as himself."
6094,"The performances by the two young stars are very good, while neither of these children may have the talent of Haley Joel Osment or Dakota Fanning (although many recent Academy Award winners do not have the acting chops of Miss Fanning). None the less these kids do a wonderful job; they give performances both humorous and nuanced. It is an original and marvelous conceit to try and get inside the head of a boy during that summer in the city when the scales are lifted on the perception of girls as givers of cooties to givers of complicated joy. Such touches as the diverse karate class (the sitcom Ashton Kutscher comparison to the orange belt interloper is very funny) to schoolyard bully keep the film grounded in a kid's experiences, though the visual references to "" The Graduate "" and "" Rebel Without A Cause "" are a bit precious even for know - it - all kids. It's very natural that these folks bump into people they know while shopping at the Fairway specialty supermarket, and there's nice costume touches of worn, local T - shirts from Fordham Law and the American Museum of Natural History."
6096,"Deepa Mehta has clearly set out to make a film with a message but she lets the story carry the message and she does not demonize the supporters of ancient oppressive practices, some of whom are motivated by faith rather than self - interest. In fact, another film, "" White Rainbow "" by w - d Dharan Mandrayar, delivers a tale of four women with similar subject matter in a modern day setting vs. the 1930's Colonial India of Mehta's "" Water . "" Perhaps the casting ten years after could very well meant to be: Seema Biswas as Shakuntula - the protective, courageous Didi with unyielding faith; Lisa Ray as Kalyani, the beautiful' sole bread - winner' with lovely hair and a tender companion to young Chuyia; John Abraham as Narayan, the idealistic young man returning to the village after his law exam and smitten by Kalyani; introducing the talented 8 year old Sarala from a village near Galle, Sri Lanka playing Chuyia, the' girl widow' - she sure captures the spirit of the story / film. He choices are also constrained by circumstance From an outsiders point of view, John's character seems to have it all, respect, a sweet mom (Waheeda)."
6098,"On discovery they are drawn into a process with none of the strutting, grandiose black clad villains so beloved of decades of British and American movies. Sixty years after their deaths, their story is told and their memory cherished. Another conventional and comfortable fiction of British and American movies cast in doubt."
6099,"A true story with a nice mix of emotion and motorcycles. He loves the ladies and he loves speeding on his vintage Indian Scout "" modified somewhat "" along the open beach of Invercargill in Southern New Zealand. Anthony Hopkins manages the problematic Kiwi accent well to deliver a touching, funny and realistic depiction of Burt in his quest to be the fastest thing on two wheels. Outstanding cameos by the likes of Annie Whittle and Diane Ladd simply add depth and verisimilitude to the film. Complete and convincing performances that warm the heart and show true humanity shining through."
6102,"It really was a lot of fun and quite the breath of fresh air for children's movies since the slump between The Incredibles and now. At first glance, you could imagine Emma Thompson giving a very over the top performance, given the warts, over-sized nose and tooth. Thanks to this, Thompson's endearing loveliness and a cute array of kids (lead by Thomas Sangster, the kid from Love Actually), Nanny McPhee emerges triumphant as one of the better kids movies in recent memory, mostly because the adults will love it too. Apart from the brilliant performances from all involved, this was a beautifully filmed piece of work. It was clever and never "" dumbed down "" as some movies peddled as family fare are these days."
6105,"And at it's heart, it's just about everyone â€” the fans, the artists, the theatre audience, and Chappelle â€” just having a good time. But if you think this movie is full of Dave Chappelles wild skits like on the Chappelle Show, ill let you know right now its not. This style also compliments Chappelle, who has a laid back kind of way of talking to people, but with a sense of humor that cuts the chase. It also isn't a stand - up comedy, but Chappelle certainly spouts some smile - turning kickers. Led by an actual band playing music as opposed to all beat machines, the groups (of which are Chappelle's own favorites, and some of which already appeared on the hit or miss musical segments of his show) bring out solid beats, and the rappers or singers are not off - putting or ridiculous."
6106,"the acting is excellent and the lead actresses are completely captivating. you will fall in love with the actresses. In fact, most of the actors here really are excellent in their parts and their timing is brilliant. But of course, most important for a British viewer - Piper Perabo's accent is remarkably good. Although now it's limited to theaters but soon the fans will be lining up to see this laugh out loud and heat warming tale of true love."
6107,"As such, it is very much worth seeing, of you are interested in how Lovecraft's stories would have been filmed when they first were written, and / or are interested in 20s impressionism in general. Here's to the people at the H. P. Lovecraft Historical Society for a job well done. This is, hands down, the most faithful adaptation of H. P. Lovecraft's writing ever made. It is easier of course to create a film as remarkably stylish as this when you have superior source materials in the form of H. P. Lovecraft's original texts, the essence of which are' beyond comprehension' architecture which can send you mad, indescribable monsters which are aeon's old. This is the best adaptation of any H. P. Lovecraft movie ever made, either by fans or big studio."
6114,"The performances were real, even Biel was good here as was Evans and Statham who truly stole the show. Likewise, the numerous flashbacks to his memories of the relationship need to show moments of beauty and understanding and not just the distrust and macho posturing shown here. There are plenty of clever cynics / nihilists to use as models. It is truly a character study of many different individuals, all of them reflecting on life as the events unfold before their eyes. Many scenes in this film is the opposite of beauty but the way they are put on camera is done so beautifully."
6126,"The Wachowski Brothers' former protÃ©gÃ©, James McTiegue, takes on the directing duties here and helms an enormously impressive first feature, using every trick in the book in a manner reminiscent of his mentors' breakout hit "" The Matrix "". The late cinematographer Adrian Biddle (the film is dedicated to his memory) does an outstanding job, Oscar - nominated Dario Marianelli's score is a fantastic accompaniment to the piece, and the visual effects are astonishing, terrifying, and deeply moving, especially in the climatic moments in Trafalgar Square. Unlike "" The Matrix "", McTiegue allows the story to be more of a focus than the action, and as a result the film is a tense and emotional thriller, with outbursts of spectacularly filmed and choreographed action. Everything looks beautiful, dark yet vibrant. If there's anything out there in the theaters that will blow you away before summer season kicks off, then this is a blast for you."
6128,"Thank You for Smoking is far and away the best satire to come out of Hollywood in years. This film is far better at true satire, its wit biting do - gooders and do - badders alike. If you don't laugh out loud, your sense of humor has become a casualty of malpractice by the Doctors of Spin and the Nursemaids of Political Correctness. The double, triple, and sometimes quadruple entendres are spoken conversationally by a star - studded ensemble cast, who clearly revel in great material and great lines. Rob Lowe as the "" genius "" behind Hollywood "" EGO "", a consultant firm which helps raise financing for movies with strategic product placement, is note - perfect in a "" small role ""."
6131,"The most outstanding feature of the past year in South African cinema is indeed Gavin Hood's Tsotsi. An South Africa / Great Britain co-production, Tsotsi, made history at the 2005 Edinburgh Film festival by becoming the first film in more than seven years to win both the Standard Life Audience Award for most popular film, and the Michael Powell Award for Best Film. The film, directed by Gavin Hood, has thus far won Audience Choice awards at five of the six international festivals it has entered. The latest triumph is the People's Choice Award at the Starz Denver International Film Festival, where Tsotsi was joint winner along with Mrs Henderson Presents. Unforgettable Tsotsi is gorgeous, riveting, poignant, and thrilling."
6136,"The most riveting emotional notes are in the first 10 minutes as Doug recalls the first hours of his amnesia and his complete feeling of being lost and real terror about not even knowing who he might be able to call to come pick him up from the hospital. When Bruce returns to London, he states that, in comparison to the women that surround him in NY, his former friends seem "" more like lads, "" a buzzword of' 90's London that belies his claim of total memory loss. Bruce expresses no surprise or is at all humbled by the rather lofty, elevated circumstances he finds himself in. Murray introduces home movie footage of the man previously known as Doug Bruce, who seems little more than a spoilt, almost callow young man of privilege, which is the one constant of both incarnations of Doug Bruce: wealth and privilege. One of the joys of memory loss apparently is rediscovering food â€” especially if you can afford to tool around NY eating in its finest restaurants."
8533,"Every character seemed to come out of the same cookie cutter form: Each had one major flaw and one minor flaw, every character is good hearted were they succeed or not, and everyone one of them had or is in an abusive relationship with someone. In the end, with lessons learned, Pip confronts his dark past and movies forward with his life. An ambitious second film from writer / director Richard Bell ("" Two Brothers ""), with a polished look, excellent photography, well - developed non-stereotypical characters (with gay and straight treated equally), and commendable efforts in emotionally and physically - demanding roles from some talented new actors (especially Paul Anthony as Pip and Brendan Fletcher as his grandfather at 18). The complex story - in the director's own words in his DVD commentary - is meant to drive a "" vortex of emotion "" pushing Pip to his breaking point, and it certainly accomplishes that. EIGHTEEN, directed by' Richard Bell' centers around an 18 year old named Pip, played by the superb' Paul Anthony' who leaves his home because of the circumstances surrounding the way his older brother died."
6140,"It's clear that the filmmaker has a deep appreciation and love for Johnston's work, and his world is painstakingly brought to life through animation, recreation, and wonderfully edited home movies and audio cassette tapes. Making full use of films, tapes, and recent interviews, Jeff Feuerzeig has produced a wonderful film that is as good a document of a man as modern techniques allow. Cut together with home movies, family photos, concert footage and interviews old and new it tells the extraordinary life of this very talented but tortured artist. But putting his mental health to one side for the moment lets focus on the work, Daniel has amassed literally thousands of tapes full of songs and spoken word, he used to make so many films and has an equally large collection of drawings and art. Feuerzeig use of Daniel's parents narrative is simply masterful - it provides important information, and at the same time illustrates the the emotional turmoil his illness causes in the lives of those that love him."
6142,"So how much talent does it take to do just that using one actor, some expert contributors, underwater footage from under the ice flow and lots of stock footage? The musical score is again very unusual for sci - fi but it does capture a strange sort of otherworldy sombre air. At times boring, the film is generally very engaging and interesting and it is well worth checking out to experience it as much as anything else. This film has two texts: 1 the plot - which is a bit of silliness about aliens coming to earth because their planet is undergoing environmental catastrophes and earthlings going to their planet for the same reason."
6147,"but there are great comedic and ironic moments as well! It is one of those interesting movies that could really be a cult classic. Creating an original film amidst the money - press - like formulaic cookie - cutters is reminiscent an act of rebellion against "" the man "", and this film has done a beautiful job of sticking it to 'em. Its style is refreshing, its dialoque fascinating, the performances powerful, and the story is both energetic and fun. The amazing attention to detail by Rian Johnson (the writer / director) and the incredible performances by Haas, Zehetner, and especially Joseph Gordon - Levitt marks this very commendable film."
6155,"The slow, suspenseful film is set mainly in the Los Angeles home of photographer Jeff, a 32 year old man whom Hayley, a mature 14 year old girl who met him online, suspects to be a pedophile. The acting was is places very good, even excellent, but making a 14 - year - old into a brilliant revenge killer for a pedophile does not send an acceptable message. Whether young Hayley was telling the truth, or was she in fact just completely insane, you won't find out until the end, but either way, it was a knockout performance by both stars and a highly recommended film! And to the IMDb reviewers, can you please quit writing that the acting is good even if you hate the plot. There is extreme moral confusion here, and the pedophile is actually a more sympathetic character than the girl."
6162,"Weak on pretty much everything else except the fights, tom yum goong has Superior action and confirms that tony jaa is an amazing performer. To sum up, Tom Yum Goong has a decent plot, a good cast with better acting than was to be expected, good cinematography, and of course, plenty of cracking, beautifully choreographed action that will not fail to impress any Martial Arts action movie enthusiast. In "" Tom Yum Goong "", Tony goes all the way to show you how talented he really is! Now if only he can learn passable English, he'll really have a chance of becoming the next big thing in Martial Arts action movies. If you thought Tony Jaa was great in Ong Bak, you haven't seen anything yet."
6167,"Her emotions and rebelliousness are raw and totally authentic. The performances are all top - notch: Norton is excellent as always, and Wood's character Tobe is perhaps the best realization of a teen ever committed to film. Judging from this film, he is a more poetic version of a 1970s Scorsese. The acting was great, the music was captivating and really heightened the emotions. It's not one for the kids obviously, but if you liked any of the Cohen Brothers movies, or Fight Club, or Garden State, you'll most likely enjoy Down In The Valley."
6174,"The young actors deliver their parts with aplomb which combined with excellent directing should make this a success. Her attempts at flirting are both painful and very funny to watch. Zoe Weizenbaum was just a joy to watch, beautiful and earnest and lovable and willing to take amazing risks for the film. Their plan to stay awake and defend it goes horribly wrong when they doze off, and the bullies light it on fire, unaware that anyone is inside. All of the children provide very genuine, endearing performances --- essential if the audience is going to empathize with them and their disturbing behavior."
6176,"But then, finally, something started to take shape: the film is, if about something, a class tale, with the South Central Hispanics roaming around Beverly Hills just looking for a place to skate and getting into various misadventures (some funny, some deadly). Ken Park certainly had moments of great tenderness, often between shocking moments (the concluding sex scene, which has been hailed by some as the most moving sex scene in cinema, certainly comes to mind), but Wassup Rockers has a different sense of tenderness. It's a minor work that has moments of real power. But within this jump - around structure, around some of the random sex scenes and skateboarding and the kind of cool scenes of the kids riding their boards to LA punk rock, Clark does create a fun B - movie. During the boys' eventful day in Beverly Hills, a parallel to The Warriors, a favorite of Clark's, can be clearly drawn."
6207,"This movie was hilarious, probably the funniest movie at Sundance this year. Stephen Colbert is brilliant as always, and Amy Sedaris' portrayal of Geri is always amazing to see (especially if you've ever seen her without the make - up on). Strangers with Candy is a truly funny movie with a somewhat serious message that never spoils the fun. But viewers should resist the notion that the movie is merely supposed to be funny. After months of anticipation, SWC Movie finally delivers the same hilarious misadventures of Jerri Blank and co, as did the TV series."
6199,"There is so many great interviews in here, and most of them are from really great people. It was good to see Iron Maiden and Judas Priest contrasted to current bands such as Slipknot to show how the spirit of the genre is thriving. Metal undeground is very complex and the variety is immense - so it is understandable that fitting all this into 90 minutes borders with the impossible. The look, the style, the attitude, the controversies both domestic (i. e. Dee Snider's battle with Tipper Gore) and foreign (a superlatively done look at the Norwegian black - metal scene, which is both tense and hilarious), the women bands in the world, and how it helps some people really get better on with life either to hear it or play it or, of course, both. Seriously, it rises far above the fulfillment of a metal fan's dreams to explore many different elements of what makes metal both an enduring artform and one that remains on the fringes."
6203,"Anyone familiar with Hal Willner's tribute concerts knows that it is a unique experience to witness one. The performances are excellent and the interviews interesting. While his experiences in New York City have been well - documented to fans, especially in his own songs, the depth of the influence of his Canadian heritage is a new insight. One of the most striking elements that separates this concert - docu from the many that have been released in recent years is the depth of the love that these performers and songwriters have for Cohen's music. This was filmed primarily at a series of Leonard Cohen tribute performances organized by producer Hal Willner in Sydney, Australia during January 2005 under the banner of "" Came So Far For Beauty ""."
6211,"The creators of this film were deeply moved when they learned of the original true - life event this film is based on, and they poured their all into making a film that would reach people on a more spiritual level than most Hollywood fare these days, without being preachy (thank heavens), and while maintaining the natural lure of an adventure story. The role of religions in transforming culture is a hot button issue these days. What Mel Gibson "" risked "" in bringing "" The Passion of the Christ "" to the screen, so did Mart Green to realize the story of "" End of the Spear "" - a truly inspiring must - see film that outlines the interaction of American missionaries with isolated people in the jungles of Ecuador in 1956. You'll also wonder why an independent film company can make such a wonderful movie when Hollywood is making bad movies based on old TV shows. Over the past 2 years a growing number of films have begun to appear with a believable spiritual connection."
6224,"Joan Plowright plays a widow who decides to live her last years of her life as an independent woman in a small retirement hotel in London. This beautiful and seemingly simple story is filled with startling gems. The humor and the superb performances by the elderly guests of the hotel is a breath of fresh vintage air. Independent film lovers will cheer for MRS. PALFREY AT THE CLAREMONT, a story with a strong script, excellent acting, and some sumptuous English scenery. She makes herself comfortable, running into The Claremont's quirky staff and residents."
6228,"the sea, Tim Robbin's eyes, Hanna's beautiful voice and her intense way of holding her feelings, Simon's delightful food in the middle of nowhere. The takes are so beautiful, the thousand different feelings that the same isolated landscape in the middle of the sea projects through the movie is unbeatable. The cast of characters is solid, and the supporting characters are developed enough so as to allow the viewer to understand, in basic terms, what brought them there. This is a good one when you're in the mood for a somewhat dark drama with romantic overtones. Isabel Coixet did a splendid work here of portrayal of the more inner parts of the human soul."
6229,"While chasing the gangsters, the police team discloses that they planted a virus in the system, stealing one billion dollars from the most different accounts, using the principle of the Chaos Theory. This theory attempts to explain the fact that a series of initial minor events apparently not interconnected can trigger a sequence of significant occurrences, producing unpredictable and complex result. Indeed this may have one or two twists too many but the twisting plot manages to keep you guessing as it unravels. Unlike other Wesley Snipes recent movies, this one was quite a surprisingly good movie."
6237,", and more often than not he is regarded as somewhat of a brilliant madman with integrity to burn, willing to battle Hollywood at any cost to keep his visions intact. These would be very tough times, indeed, for the likes of a young Fellini, Kubrick, and Lynch. There were also laughs, applause, and continued debates concerning what the film was really about (how often does that occur these days after a screening?) But for those who are anxiously wanting Time Bandits 2 or desire some degree of Pythonesque humor, Tideland will disturb, bore, and profoundly bother to the point of contempt. Easily one of the creepiest but most interesting performance by a child in years."
6257,"La Tigre e La Neve is a fable about love, love in the face of adversity, stubborn optimism, hope and desperation and relationships between people of different races and creeds. But alas, this is no Life is Beautiful, and although it has its moments with the beautiful make belief cinematographic elements in the end, it somehow lacked that extra bit of emotional depth to truly move an audience. And just like he did with his masterpiece, La Vita Ã¨ Bella, he perfectly mixes comedy and tragedy, telling a story about love, life and death. It's bittersweet, and with moments that might touch you. Although infused with bits of comedy now and then, the movie takes a long hard look at how much one will do for someone else whom you love deeply."
6238,"Mixing biblical allegories, especially the story of Job (the Fall being also an essential part of the film, yet not actually in the plot itself), with modern drama and dark comedy, Adams Ã¦bler does not fit into traditional categories. Together with Ulrich Thomsen who plays the Nazi on re-socialization, he carries the viewers through a fresh, shocking, dark, utterly intelligent, and exceptionally both humorous and psychological experience. Being more than rich on nerve - shattering imagery, great performances, and a very well crafted story, this film also leads a sharp edged, underlying parallel to an ancient story that comes to life in the film, and ends in a brilliant paradoxical way. With his brilliant authenticity in the character of the troubled reverend, Mads Mikkelsen ("" pusher "", "" bleeder "", "" blinkende luger "", "" de grÃ¸nne slagtere "") rises up from just being a good bi-actor, to becoming a complete artist of performance. The dialouge is great, tons of punchlines that bubbles up the day after or even weeks after you have seen the film."
6266,"Although Russo was initially leaning towards the actor James Gandolfini for this crucial role, Harris captures the sensitivity and emotional depth of Miles that few other actors could achieve. Other members of this stellar cast include Paul Newman (as Miles' crusty father Max); Joanne Woodward (as the town matriarch Francine Whiting); Danielle Panabaker (as Miles' daughter); Helen Hunt (as Miles' ex-wife Janine); Aidan Quinn (as Miles' brother David); Theresa Russell (as Miles' co-worker and confidante at the grill); Estelle Parsons (as Miles' mother - in - law); and Kate Burton (as Cindy Whiting and lifelong admirer of Miles). In Russo's novel, the scenes from the past are written in italics, placing the key love relationship of Miles' mother Grace and Charlie Mayne in bold relief. Schepisi's transitional moments between past and present were brilliantly conceived in the film. The story has great scope and deals with such themes as family dysfunction, small - town gossip, commerce and industry, political infighting, and, above all, family secrets."
6296,"Selini is like a combination of Godard, Herzog and classic Czech animation - the kind of committed and convincing political film making that is increasingly rare these days. But the nightmarish atmosphere of confusion and fear, enhanced by gruesome stop motion animation between scenes, is both compelling, disturbing and extremely effective in communicating the directors ideas. Maybe it would help to tease them out in writing: on one hand, there is the libertine, who does whatever he wants and seems to take particular joy in blasphemy on the other hand, there is the vicious authoritarian doctor, who feels legitimate in enjoying torturing the inmates even if he ciphers that enjoyment through his medical practice."
6302,"While the subject of national and international politics has been the subject of many critically acclaimed documentaries, Street Fight concentrates on the 2002 Mayoral election in one urban city, Newark, N. J., which is wracked by homelessness, drug addiction and poverty. The film's title is quite appropriate because Television ads are meaningless, but rather these hard - fought battles are won on the street. Amongst the insightful interviews with Booker's multi-racial supporters and campaign staff, the most moving were the tearful ones upset at these charges. The 2002 Newark, New Jersey Mayoral race is something most voters in the U. S. could care less about. A good documentary that if you already despise politics will make you despise them more, and to those that like them, it will open your eyes to the ugliness that is just about all campaigns, especially here in the U. S."
6303,"This powerful and touching true story was filmed in the real locations with the support of the survivors of the massacre. As usual Hurt's performances stretch beyond impeccable to a level of authenticity one could only expect from someone who was actually there. This film is worthy of all the plaudits that one can offer. This is not a Christian themed movie or anything like that, but it is a film of love. The closing credits are well worth sticking around for."
6310,"Just one problem, and that is the way Freddy and Christians characters talk: "" Wassup dawg / dude / homie "", it's grating and annoying. His portrayal of Jim David, an ex-army ranger, is coated in layers of emotional complexity and psychological deterioration. If Denzel Washington can be rewarded for best actor in Training Day then Bale deserves his just rewards for Harsh Times. A cross between Benny Blanco (Carlito's Way) and Ethan Hawke's character in Training Day, Rodriquez shows his ability in mixing comedic moments up with emotional intensity and apathy. Rodriguez (who was at the World Premiere) and Bale give stellar performances."
6342,"the pace is a bit slower than usual teen movies but its much more mature and still ends up being funny. The other actresses (including two young women from "" Battle Royale "" and a real - life j - rock star) are also excellent. The latter better describes Nobuhiro Yamashita's Linda Linda Linda, a beautifully constructed study of young love, high school politics, and of course, rock and roll. Kudos to Nobuhiro Yamashita for putting together such a cute and impressive cast of young women who make up the band who are all skilled actresses. Shiba High School is holding their annual Holly Festival complete with a musical talent show, and three friends - drummer Kyoko (Aki Madea, Battle Royale), keyboardist - turned - guitarist Kei (Yu Kasii, Lorelei) and bassist Nozomi (Shiori Sekine, of the real band Base Ball Bear) are struggling to get a band together."
6345,"He had aspirations of attending Cambridge and becoming a lawyer. He has done some acting work thanks to the Up series, and his honest and welcoming account of his last 7 years is a highlight. For all the differences in their back grounds, the participants are seem to have a similar trait - optimism and resilience, and it is satisfying to watch. Apted began filming a group of children at age seven, and has followed and filmed their lives every seven years since then. But even though some seem to resent the filmmakers' intrusion in their lives, they generally seem to understand the larger value of the series and twelve of the original fourteen kids continue to participate, even though they have misgivings or regrets about it."
6171,"He said they did a great job adapting the book to film, and although not everything was there, they did the best that they could with the time they had, and he was impressed. the atmosphere makes it more fun and also you can talk about this with others after seeing it, instead of catching up to everyone later and possibly getting spoilers before you watch. In short, you go see this movie (or read the book) for how it challenges popularly - held beliefs; not for its rich, engaging character development. Those who often complain that movies don't stay true to the books that they're based on will find comfort in the fact that Akiva Goldsman and Ron Howard have stayed incredibly close to the original text when translating it onto the screen. Along the way, the two uncover a grand conspiracy on the part of a renegade Catholic order to protect a secret that, if it were revealed, could shake the whole of Western civilization down to its very foundations."
6172,"During the final battle she just stands around in the background for - literally - twenty minutes until she decides to annihilate San Francisco, obviously for the sole purpose of creating a "" cool "" FX sequence. Brett Ratner obviously has no love or respect whatsoever for the comics or even the previous films, as is displayed by the following creative disasters that riddle this movie: - Nightcrawler, who was a visually entrancing and emotionally interesting character in the last installment has mysteriously disappeared from the X-Men. - Rattner introduces new Mutants left right and center without developing their character or even their motivation one bit - something Singer paid great attention to. - Gone is the subtle, inventive dialog from parts 1 and 2. He was in it for all of two minutes yet in the trailer they make it seem as though he is an important character to this film when in fact he does nothing as well."
6173,"Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Anniston put in solid performances in a film that feels strikingly real at times. Yes, there are some very funny scenes. The bottom line is that the Break - Up is solid film built with Hollywood money and stars that chooses a route its benefactors rarely allow to be taken. Hats off to Jen and Vince for an outstanding performance. The movie definitely has its funny moments."
6606,"But even the waves of the best made Hollywood pictures come with a comfort zone of music, reassuring dialogue or other reminders that it is' all pretend'. Bernard Moitessier, within reach of the end and possible victory after six months alone at sea, discovers he has found peace in the vast loneliness. After the first solo circumnavigation of the ocean in 1967, adventurers and watchers of adventurers began seeking the next one - up. This beautifully edited film also follows the journey of Bernard Moitessier, an experienced and enigmatic French sailor, who was in second place and certain of the fastest journey prize, when he abruptly left the race, unable to deal with the clamour and publicity he knew he would face, and sailed into the wide blue yonder, eventually pulling up some 10 months later in Tahiti. Deep Water examines the pressures and ambitions on an ordinary man in a compelling documentary."
6175,"The filmmakers have gone so far as to perfect reflections in the cars and to pay careful attention to weeds growing out of cracks in the sidewalk. The cars have a definite realistic look, especially with the rendering (man, the reflections!) Even the shine on the clean cars looks so real. Thanks to Director Lasseter's strong attention to detail, going so far as to insist that the vehicles bend and gesture in ways that were true to their construction, every car and truck truly becomes a unique character and personality. Well, at least Pixar makes it look that way because with Cars they have once again succeeded."
6439,"Sean Ellis did a great job to make those scenes look that perfect. The scenes where everything but Ben is frozen and he walks around the store drawing the portraits of the women just strike the right chord. Literally built around the short film of the same name which screened at festivals in 2004, triple threat writer / director / producer Sean Ellis did something ingenious. But there is a wide array of noteworthy performances from the supporting cast, not just in Barry and Matt. Here there is a kind of seamless intercutting of scenes, scenery, flashbacks, reality and fantasy that all melt together fluently as the director navigates through Ben's life and thoughts."
6177,"Damien is creepy enough, and there are some OK dream sequences that offer a couple of good jump scares. What made it a classic also made it a prime target for re-making. As in the original, the plot is moved along by mysterious and terrible deaths. "" This is a well - produced, but uninspired re-make of the 1976 box - office revelation. Having said that, these scenes are a little different from the original (most of them anyway) and again, as a horror fan, you'll enjoy the fact that they don't pull any punches graphically."
8089,"Chaharshanbeh Soori is a beautiful movie, directed with so much subtlety and refinement, bringing the best of the actors out of them. The superb narratives and very good filming are topped with great story telling, making it a must - see and a fresh blood in the Iranian cinema. The complication of human behavior and psyche as well as the flow of the events, thoughts, and emotions, remind one of Milan Kundera's novels. Great job and congratulations to Asghar Farhadi and Mani Haghighi. Her working - class origins are succinctly contrasted with those of the middle - class Samieis (perhaps Farhadi is emulating Bergman's Persona, the 1966 face - off between a mentally ill actress and her more well - adjusted nurse, charged with taking care of her)."
6180,"Adam Sandler did a great job in playing a work - aholic. The jokes come pretty fast, right from the get - go. That theme leads to some touching scenes in the final 30 minutes of this comedy. As funny as this film is, you would be hard - pressed not to have some tears in your eyes at some point near the end of this film. Adam Sandler has shown that he is capable of playing a serious character in contrast o the aggressive and funny character he normally plays in his film, Click is no different, Sandler is both funny and serious at the right moments, Kate Bekinsale is great as Donna his wife, and Christopher Walken is excellent as always as Morty, the Bed, Bath and Beyond Employee."
6182,"Blazing with self confidence, Miranda Pristley is a monumental modern queen. Even though she portrayed variations of the same demonic character in 1989's "" She - Devil "" and 1992's "" Death Becomes Her "", Meryl Streep truly nails it in this smart, creative 2006 comedy by underplaying the role and saving her verbal talons for pivotal moments. Fortunately, director David Frankel has come along well since his 1995 Woody Allen knockoff, the irritatingly unctuous "" Miami Rhapsody "", and one can see his progression in his smart work on episodes of "" Sex in the City "" and "" Entourage "". He moves the film at such a sharp, fast clip that it feels like an accurately frenzied portrayal of the inner workings of the world of haute couture. The one - line zingers also come fast and furious thanks to Aline Brosh McKenna's deep - dish script based on Lauren Weisberger's best - selling novel, but the vitriol does not come at the expense of character development and a shrewdly observed storyline about all - or - nothing careers when working for media royals and courtiers."
6183,"Stellan Skarsgard is completely believable as the wretched Bootstrap Bill, a man who has fallen to the depths as far as he can go, and yet can still find the strength to endure it all in the love he has for his son, William. Returning producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Gore Verbinski make sure the action sequences, the sets, the costumes, the make - up and the special effects give the audience a familiarity to the original while also taking them on a whole new adventure. The supporting cast is truly stellar; Bill Nighy as Captain Davy Jones, Stellan Skarsgard as Bill' Boostrap' Turner and Naomie Harris as Tia Dalma are simply brilliant. There's a good plot, wonderful sets, great acting and plenty of laughs. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest does the right thing as a sequel: It maintains the same carefree spirit of the original and creates an even more fitting story to the whole Pirates lore."
6184,"She plays this role a little more low key than usual, but she's still irresistible, evidenced by her black bikini scene where she proves that she inherited what was always her mom's best * ahem * asset. Rounding out the cast, straight - man Matt Dillon's cool as always, and Seth Rogen, though woefully underused, brings an impressive laughs - to - screen time ratio."
6185,"Jay and Bob's antics are always a great break from the other action, never an intrusion, even when they are TRYING to intrude, by making asses of themselves (literally) in the background of the primary action. The movie is also more realistic than some of the other View Askew movies; more like Clerks, obviously. Unless you know your girlfriend is hip and not easily offended, test her with a DVD of "" CLERKS "" first to see if she "" gets "" the humor. Wow, the return of the clerks, indeed! Like the argument over which franchise has the better "" Return "" movie; "" Lord of the Rings "" or "" Star Wars ""."
6186,"First of all, it's a good family film, with enough tense moments to keep you watching, and enough laugh - out - loud moments to calm you down. The dialogue was not necessarily hilarious, but the actors, especially Paul Giamatti (Cleveland) delivered the lines extremely well. Paul Giamatti is always fantastic, and while Bryce Dallas Howard seemed to act in the same manner as she did in The Village, she was still convincing. M. Night has a rare talent that will go completely under the radar for this film because no one will see it. Like how MULLHOLLAND DRIVE was dream realized on film, THE LADY IN THE WATER is a campfire tale, it's not a terribly cohesive, and demands that the audience put the pieces together."
6187,"Uma Thurman is perfect as the mercurial super-heroine, an uber - babe, mysteriously named G - Girl, who unlike most in her sisterhood, is not * always * dedicated to truth, justice, and the American Way. If you want a light touch of fun, you should definitely watch G - Girl's and average Matt's adventures, especially to cheer up your partner. He's given two of the best comic performances of 2006 (the other in the pretty much unreleased Idiocracy). It's one of the funniest sex scenes ever. It just wasn't very fresh and after about forty minutes, the film wore out it's welcome."
6189,"Marie Antoinette is the film equivalent of one of those expensive fashion magazines that pepper indie art galleries â€“ packed with achingly hip aesthetics but free of meaningful content. She is shown as both bold and humble, two qualities which had quasi-miraculous effects on both the court and the angry mob, as is shown in some of the film's most touching moments."
6190,"The movie is filled with history, politics, technology, innovation, and some very interesting personalities. Yes, most of the people who apparently leased one of GM's electric cars were celebrities and / or people of some measure of wealth. As a onetime owner of an electric car (the EV1) and a savvy filmmaker, he has quadruple checked his facts â€” and they are alarming. A look into the anticipated introduction of electric cars in the mid '90s to their mysterious recall a few years later. Giving a brief history of the electric car, which interestingly used to be more popular than gasoline based cars (!)"
6192,"It still may be an effective tool for educating democrats that were previously uninformed on global warming. And while he may have showed up for some six years ago as stiff and stodgy, in this context he is masterful in blending the informative with the entertaining. This isn't some platform Gore picked up in the last few years; this is something he has been fighting for his whole life, which gives him a credible and reliable voice in this issue and documentary. And, it's true that the CO2 is increasing at this moment. In the foreground a solitary grasshopper pump drew up oil that had laid dormant for hundreds of millions of years."
6195,"As a Disney channel movie, it inevitably has several flaws, the most obvious of which is the clichÃ©, cheesy plot between the two main characters. At least REAL musicals that used those themes, like Hairspray and Grease, had actual talent behind them, as well as good songs and actual FUN. After a lot of deliberation, Gabriella and Troy audition for the musical, much to Sharpay's, and their friends', dismay. If you're a fan of musicals you're sure to enjoy it. The songs were great especially "" Get your head in the game ""."
6196,"He's uninterested in politics (at that time China was being "" invaded "" by shiploads of foreigners), and adopts a whole host of disciples who prove to be his downfall. But Huo returns a more calm and measured person, setting up the famous Jing Wu Sports Federation, and taking on a whole host of foreign fighters to inspire his countrymen that they are not the "" sick men of the east "". As this is much touted as Jet Li's final martial arts film, it's plain obvious of the messages he wished to use this platform to spread. Spending many years there, Huo learns to embrace peace and live out his simple life with the villagers. This is Jet Li's best movie in years."
6197,"Some really good change in this 3rd movie was the feature of drifts instead of pure racing (shown so far in the previous series). Sean 17 years old, played by Lucas Black, age 23, but looks 32, is the average American, with a slightly heavy, bad and annoying southern accent with a cowboy style goes to Tokyo after a race ends badly, there he meets with another bunch of 17yo who also look like in their late 20's, early 30's, and all have money, cars and lots of girls, including the main one, Neela, played by Nathalie Kelley, who obviously, gets disputed by both Sean, and his comic - book' arch-villain' D. K. Basically this movie comes down to good looking cars, fast paced action, and Asian cleavage. Also, the big "" final race "" occurs, and the hero's dad (amazingly) has the body of a classic 60s Mustang in his garage (a somewhat unlikely situation in Japan--not just the car, but the idea that he has a entire garage for this purpose in one of the world's most expensive and crowded cities). Obviously these two must be his best friend and girlfriend since they are the only non-Asians around."
6198,"Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties is a happy, funny, silly movie. It was colorful, well done, excellent quality, etc. but let's face it, by being designed for 5 - 10 year - olds, it also had to be really sloooooooow. Brekin Myer is a charming actor with good vibes. Anyway --- Bob Hoskins is a hoot as the bulldog, and the other animal voices are good, too. At just over 90 - minutes it fits fully into their attention span."
6441,""" Ils "" don't have a great plot but it's not two minutes of suspense here and there. It builds beautifully, is directed by two craftsmen in their art and the performances from the two main actors are very natural and just excellent. The movie runs thru a hour and ten minutes always packed with great thrilling cinematography that could take you into a breathless awe. Every single creak and footstep is perfectly placed for the best scares. The performances, however, seem solid and the film is expertly shot and musically scored - all these elements add to the power of the film."
6200,"The next 45 minutes of the film were awesome. Lex Luthor shows how truly evil he can be, and again Spacey does an amazing job here. There's something about Clark that Lois likes, she's really internally in love with him but can't admit it, and when he comes into the picture as Superman, it throws a kink in the on - the - rocks love. Superman Returns is a love story between a woman and SUPERMAN, Clark is like a pile of horse maneur to Lois. The flight scenes were beautiful; Superman cut a very majestic figure as he soared across skylines and starscapes."
6202,""" The Road to Guantanamo "" is shot as a pseudo-documentary. A nation that stands for human rights and decent treatment of prisoners. This administration (and its blowhard allies) have done such a wonderful job convincing Americans that speaking out against their policies is tantamount to being unpatriotic. The "" interregators "" are just like police everywhere, they lie and deceive just to get someone to confess. Voices of politicians (Jack Straw, Donald Rumsfeld), lawyers for the prisoners, and the chief legal officer of England, Lord Justice Styne, in a stunning rebuke, are also heard."
6596,"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time tells a wonderful story centered on 3 friends, the tomboyish and clumsy Makoto Konono (voiced by Riisa Naka), and two hunks Chiaki Mamiya (Takuya Ishida) and Kousuke Tsuda (Mitsutaka Itakura). The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is a Japanese animated film that dwells in high school life and all that comes with it, the crushes, the puppy love, the platonic friendship and friendship that soon blossoms into romance. All in all, if you look at it, the film is a touching tale bursting with emotions and it just warms your heart in all the right places. Animation is years ahead of its time, and it still is an excellent example of what happens when music is in harmony with the story / animation."
6204,"The performances are probably the best thing about this film. There is a lot to not like in this film, but Posey does shine, and some of the "" 50 million women who suffer from orgasmic dysfunction "" might enjoy "" The Oh! Paul Rudd, Danny Devito, and Parker Posey each gave fantastic and thoughtful performances. The offbeat comedy has both edge and levity to it, Parker Posey and Paul Rudd give their best performances to date (the film is smart enough to present both sides of the orgasm issue), and the dialogue / delivery / timing set the tone and kept it going throughout the movie. Cast is tops, particularly Posey, Bailey and DeVito."
6205,"It felt more like watching a documentary (minus all the familiar faces) and every time the laughter became almost unbearable, a little dash of agony or melancholic sadness was thrown in, and spawned aching tears. Keeping up with the recent buzz - worthy films coming out of Sundance the past couple years, Little Miss Sunshine is a gem of a movie. Do yourself a favor and see this sweet, subtle at times and gut - bustingly hilarious at others, perfectly pitched ensemble piece. Everything he has done comes to a surprising result at the eponymous beauty pageant for the biggest laughs of the movie, really great stuff subverting the grotesque surrealism surrounding any pageant of this kind. The strong cast sounds not a single false note, and when the more touching moments arrive, they don't seem forced the way they would in most other big - budget behemoths, because these moments are truly earned."
6208,"Once the film turns its attention toward the tournament, the personalities of the top contenders are highlighted with the makings of a classic showdown among three - time champion and professional puzzle - maker Trip Payne; Al Sanders, the middle - aged perennial also - ran who can never seem to rank above third; and prodigious twenty - year old Tyler Hinman, the potential usurper who could become the youngest champion ever. Structured a bit like 2002's "" Spellbound "", the entertaining film that builds toward the 1999 Scripps National Spelling Bee, first - time director Patrick Creadon uses the 2005 American Crossword Puzzle Tournament as his climactic event where a group of nimble - minded crossword solvers vie for the championship. What makes all of this work, and what actually makes crossword puzzles become good enough for cinema, is watching smart people, un-cluttered for the most part with problems, who can focus all of their attentions on this one activity, to the point of obsessive compulsive behavior. The great fun of "" Wordplay "" is watching a master constructor of the stature of Merl Reagle creating a daily crossword right in front of the camera, and explaining the logic behind it. This delightful documentary, directed by Patrick Creadon, is a dream come true for people that enjoy to solve crossword puzzles."
6210,"Underneath this clever outline however, lies a repertoire of original, fresh and hilarious skits. There is no doubt that they are all talented comics."
6580,"Though the story focuses on the obsessions of its pawn shop owning protagonist, namely a pretty girl's ass, a smelly backed - up bathroom drain, and a glass eye, it still manages to be full of intelligent, thought - provoking ideas and themes. The film is full of irony and sarcastic humor and criticizes very well those people who think they can buy everything with their money, even other people. Even the title (which literary translated means "" The smell of the drain "") is sarcastically humorous and a metaphor to characterize such people, without any character, scrupulous, or even feelings! The acting by Selton Mello, which plays LOURENÃ‡O, the main character, is excellent! But it actually showed to be very good and unusual, with the character LourenÃ§o becoming more strange, sick and bizarre as the time passes."
6212,"If you are looking for a fun, clean movie with plenty of laughs and chuckles, this is definitely one you don't want to miss! It could be because of tragedy, or rumours, or just for the simple reason that it's unoccupied, or has some elderly, probably unkindly, strange looking old folk living in it, that gives the creeps to anyone under the age of 10. They did a fantastic job of matching right voices with the right characters. Where _ Shrek _ emphasizes pop culture references for adult appeal, this movie targets adults' memories of childhood, effectively drawing adults into enjoying it like the kids in the audience. It is true that Monster House does contain a predominantly dark theme, with a considerable amount of eerie scenes to support it."
6213,"It's not the funniest movie of the year or the scariest, but it is a good movie if you're looking for mindless fun involving a lot of snakes on an airplane, some gratuitous gore and nudity, and a few great Samuel L. Jackson moments, check it out. If you enjoy any of the following, then this movie is for you: gruesome deaths, breasts, cheesy physical humor, Samuel L. Jackson, or venomous reptiles. A lot of people on IMDb have given Snakes on a Plane a 10/10 rating and left comments like "" omg this is best movie ever lol . "" If you are looking for a deep introspective look at the horrors of airborne terrorism and reptilian exploitation, look somewhere else, and don't complain about it. If you love camp, over-the-top action movies, then why not worship a camp action film that's actually good?"
6214,"In a movie landscape dominated by software - approved story arcs, twentysomething tastes and assembly - line formula fare for kiddies, it's a source of both satisfaction and inspiration to see Allen pursuing his highly personal and still - rewarding path. Scarlett Johansson proves well - cast in the Diane Keaton - type role, and at no time is there any uncomfortable moments between her and the much older Woody. To a great extent, unlike Farrell, Branaugh, Cusack or even Mia Farrow before her, Scarlett is not required to use the Woody voice to evoke the Woody role. As with any great artist, Mr. Allen's craft evolved over the years and he lost some fans, while picking up others. This attraction motivated him to write his best comedy in years."
6215,"So, whether you are a will Farrell fan or not, if you just enjoy fun movies that will have you laughing out loud from start to finish, than you should definitely go check this movie out when it comes out. In theory, this should be hilarious, but in reality Talladega Nights just doesn't hold up. The ensemble of characters doesn't produce that same energy that Anchorman had, but Talladega Nights did have some priceless bits of humor and it works just as well, perhaps even better, as a feel - good movie. Overall, while Telladega Nights did have some funny moments, nearly all of them were shown in the preview; it's telling when the funniest moments in the film come during the outtakes shown over the end credits. You could tell Will Ferrell and Sacha Cohen (aka Ali G) and John C. Reilly all had the opportunity to improvise lines and riff on one another, and all three were pretty good."
6216,"The film has huge plot holes and probably hundreds of continuity errors but rampaging dinosaurs, goodish CGI and another athletic comic turn from Ben Stiller, together with the gorgeous Carla Gugino make this near perfect Xmas cinematic fair. To keep both the apartment and the son's affections, he accepts a job as night watchman at a New York City Natural History Museum, where an Egyptian tablet has for some decades administered a powerful magic spell that causes history literally to "" come alive . "" Also, a fantastic group of supporting characters like Gus, Mr. McPhee and Atilla the Hun."
6217,"A couple of moments with Pena standing there on the concourse were effective in creating a sense of horrific surrealism, and the moments right before the collapse were sudden and chilling. U93 told a specific story (the experience of the passengers on the plane) and placed it within a context (what was happening with air traffic control and the military). It is a powerful work of film that tells the story without sensationalizing the event and the anger and hatred for the attackers following the attacks. Through impeccably detailed sets and flawless special effects, director Oliver Stone and his film - making team recreate these hectic moments in all - too - realistic detail. They are also well supported by Maria Bello and Magie Gyllenhaal as their respective wives, who spend much of the film enduring an agonizing wait to learn the fate of their husbands."
6218,"Unlike many other existential comedies, Fiction is sweet and almost innocent in its design. Going along with the story itself, it feels a little ill - paced in some few instances, but for the most part sucks you right in and keeps you there. His writing feels vibrant and fresh, and in a film industry with absolutely little originality or thought, it is just great that movies like this slip through and get green - lighted. He may deliver some of the funniest lines in the movie, but he is totally mature and at ease in this role. Maggie Gyllenhaal also shines here, and clearly has the makings for an Oscar sometime in the late future."
6219,"Both "" Collateral "" and "" Heat "" were notable for the way in which they delved deep into the psyche of the central characters, providing compelling personal drama to go along with the heists, hits and gunplay. What saves the film from being a bust is the visual splendor and great action sets. Mann once again proves that when it comes to creating a gritty atmosphere and staging shootouts, he's among the best in the business. It lacked everything that made MV great. Great soundtrack, flashy cars, and tongue in cheek devil may care attitude of Tubbs and Crocket."
6221,"It's very funny at parts, but be prepared for some serious drama. It's an amazing film and if Will Smith doesn't get at least an Oscar Nom, then the Oscars will just suck. Everybody needs to see especially the people in this world that take everything for granted, watch this movie, it will change you! Chris will do what ever it takes to pay his expenses and to get a new job. His acting, along with Thandie Newton and Jaden Smith, were great."
6222,"Shame about his limited acting ability though, as the infamous John Tucker was simply a more confident version of his "" Desperate Housewives "" character John Rowland, but nevertheless, Metcalfe seems to enjoy his characters, and certainly makes them come to life. The girls are all terrific and Jesse Metcafe struts his acting and physique to an even higher standard than what he demonstrated on Desperate Housewives. John Tucker (Jesse Metcalfe of "" Desperate Housewives "") is the star of their high school's basketball team, and he's secretly dating three girls simultaneously."
6223,"The actors voices and characterization are terrific. The movie started off a little slow for the first, maybe, 10 - 20 minutes, as they set up the story, but then everything really takes off and is a ton of fun! The animation in this film is soooo well done - some of the scenes are incredibly beautiful and the landscapes they came up with could keep you entertained all by themselves. There were a few jokes aimed @ an older audience but this helped keep more mature viewers feeling they had spent their 9 bucks on a delightful film. Julia Roberts and Nicolas Cage are the two biggest names in a strong cast that lends their voices to their cartoonish alter egos."
6573,"It's a bizarre tale of love, friendship, and the afterlife told through the eyes of director Goran Dukic and is based on the short story "" Kneller's Happy Campers "" by Etgar Keret. Patrick Fugit does a good job trying to make an incredibly uncompelling character watchable, and Shea Wigham's a riot when given the chance. This fanciful movie opens with Fugit's character Zia organizing, cleaning, and straightening his room, readying himself for his death. to nowhere, searching for the woman and meet Mikal, who is also on a search, for the PIC: People in Charge. The film is well shot with great music and tender moments."
6227,"Clever stories about the pasts and workings of crime - lords and their cronies, and how they all relate to Chelios. But none of the grand choreography from the Transporter movies is even on display here. He is fit, projects a great screen charisma and knows enough martial arts to allow for nicely choreographed fight scenes. Okay, granted, pretty much all action movies use these tools but, in the good ones, the directors use them imaginatively and well. With creativity in the genre previously limited to new twists on chases and fight scenes, it's a real pleasure to see films such as CRANK, ONG - BAK and BANLIEUE 13 (District 13) emerging."
6447,"The beauty of the film lies in its dead - pan depiction of a respectable neighbourhood maintaining core values while making a place for zombies and the special hazards they pose. Fido's talented headliners (Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connelly, Dylan Baker, and Tim Blake Nelson) stand as a testament to the brilliance of the script. Fido tackles all these possibilities in a sweet and surprisingly classy way, with much thanks to the work of Connelly (as one of said zombies) and young TV actor K'Sun Ray, who seems at times to be a better young Elijah Wood than the young Elijah Wood was. The production design and music are exquisitely 50s, to a tee. It's really smart satire that nails everything from Homeland Security to race issues, while at the same time leaving you laughing and realizing how much are world lives in fear."
6550,"The concepts are straightforward and are practically dictated to you by the narrator; this becomes essential to the understanding of the story, as there is just way too much going on to take in on your own. However, instead of hindering the film, it makes these seemingly unrelated scenes string together into a true tapestry that is worth exploring. You can get a pretty good idea of Southland Tales from a quick description of its characters. Dwayne Johnson plays Boxer Santaros, a movie star in Richard Kelly's all - too - near dystopian future. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays an ageing porn - star with a business portfolio that includes energy drinks."
6449,""" Rescue Dawn "" features classical and feverishly transcendent direction from Herzog, breathtaking cinematography of Laos and Vietnam from Peter Zeitlinger, a triumphant and evocative music score from Klaus Bedelt, and Oscar - worthy performances from an amazing cast. Herzog puts the cast through the ringer in artistically rendered depictions of torture, horror, and survival in the harshest of conditions. Even in some of the most cringe - worthy scenes, Herzog turns what could've been wallowing on its head--witness the fantastic transition from Bale eating live worms and one crawling in his beard to a beautiful caterpillar leisurely making its way across a leaf in the peaceful jungle. Herzog does a great job of depicting tiny bits of humanity and dignity shining through in the most inhumane conditions, and how the will to survive can triumph over death. As played by Christian Bale, who goes once again to be totally gaunt, Dengler is a pilot who's been stripped of everything except for his will to live - which he has in spades, and is both very strong and vulnerable at the same time."
6256,It's most valuable to see by those who are NOT fundamentalists to understand a growing and already substantial movement of which most are not aware exists. One thesis he advances is that the world is changing so fast it's threatening the adjustment of many cultures and sub-cultures.
6230,"This story questions the nature of reality, in personal relationships carried on over long distances. Everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility, and real life just sort of plods along â€” no? For quality and content alone, The Night Listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days."
6234,"What a wonderful surprise to find such a terrific film of dance and music in STEP UP and the actors / dancers were out of this world. The leads (Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum) were OK as actors, but their dancing throughout the movie was impressive and mesmerizing. The movie has romance, comedy, tragedy, and nearly everything else you would want in a good movie. A jock fights external prejudices to become a dancer with an accomplished partner and a teach who sees something special. The music / soundtrack of the movie was also very good, which made the "" drama "" scenes more bearable."
6235,"If the one liner isn't enough to make you laugh, add the highly adorable factor from Ryan Newman as Cindy Collins is tops. Take a bitter misfit ex-superhero who can't be any less interested in training new recruits and make it funny. From X-Men and Sky High to Spy Kids and Fantastic 4, on and on, this movie steals from everyone. It is a movie that makes fun of super hero movies. And to keep things consistent, all the rest of the songs in the movie are also outdated."
6236,"Gosling was voted best actor at Sundance, 2006, in an IndieWire poll, which also picked Half Nelson as best film. Shareeka Epps is equally riveting as Drey, the student who learns his secret, voted best actress in the Sundance IndieWire poll. Epps also led the list of six of this year's breakthrough performances by the New York Times. This prize is established at international film festivals, and its aim is to promote film art and to particularly encourage new and young cinema. "" "" Beautifully shot, beautifully acted, and just like life in which ideals can float on top of emotional turmoil and children teach teachers."
8429,"CONRAD BOYS is not a bad movie: the story though frequently used by others holds its own, the style of direction keeps the pace moving, the message of the movie is worth stating. Soon, Doug reappears, two years sober, with a decent job and place to live, wanting to help out. The heart and soul of the picture is the exciting stranger, Jordan (quite well brought to life by Nick Bartzen). In his commentary Lo says Brokeback Mountain is one of the best films of the past ten years, and declares that Paul Thomas Anderson is a genius. The cast Lo has selected is fine - especially the promising young Nick Bartzen and the solid Barry Shay."
6533,"The action scenes were certainly effective, with plenty of stylized Tae Kwon Do all over the place. When it turns out the aggressor in all this is their old pal Pil - Ho, who grew up to be a remorseless psychopath, and who has become a successful land developer because of his corrupt and ruthless ways, it sets the stage for an epic battle for the ages. The cinematic flourishes on a the visual level are the icing on the cake to a story about loyalty, brotherhood, betrayal and nostalgia. It is extremely well - shot, well - lit, and well - directed, and director Ryoo employs all manner of tactics to delight the eye of the viewer and keep them invested. Thanks to indicators like this movie, South Korea has become a hotbed of film talent in recent years."
6240,"With this well thought out story and with laughs mixed in, this is a good movie. All the cast delivered fantastic performances--hire this one out with a friend, it's a bloody crack up! The rest of the cast also did their jobs perfectly, this is an excellent little film with a nice message."
6242,"This movie was stunning in many aspects. Visually in terms of locations, inside and out, there was great consistency and a nothing seemed strained. Paul Giamatti (sp) played an admirable role and took the viewer by surprise in many elements of the story. Director came out for a Q&A after and was very amiable in answering questions. Shot entirely in the Czech Republic at gorgeously befitting locations, this is a beautifully made period piece, complete with genuine turn - of - the - century illusions, a wonderful soundtrack, lovely cinematography and an intriguing story."
6243,"A moment that may have felt like surrender to Elizabeth II is the most moving and powerful moment in a film filled with moving and powerful moments. No, Morgan's script is pure conjecture, a fiction about real events lent a considerable degree of seeming' authenticity' by director Stephen Frears handling of the material and use of documentary footage mainly taken from the television programmes of the day."
6244,"So, if you are looking for a good laugh and an all around good time go see Beerfest you will not be disappointed. Their contact brings them to a secret beer competition, the Beerfest "", where they are offended by Baron Wolfgang von Wolfhausen (Juergen Prochnow) and the German branch of their family that accuse their grand grandmother of being a prostitute and their grandfather of stealing an old receipt of the best beer in Germany. Within this genre, the latter is a fine movie as well--BeerFest simply stays on track a little better, instead of being a slapdash montage of funny scenes. Beerfest has got to be the funniest movie of year. It's one of those classic movies you just watch with your buddies and laugh your asses off over and over because some of the scenes just catch you off guard."
6248,"First, the good news: any concerns Cage would be airlifted from the Wicker Man's flaming jaws at the last minute by a fleet of black CIA helicopters can be laid to rest: he toast. Every element that made the original great â€“ the lovingly detailed depictions of folk customs, the ingenious score, the dialogue (Lord Summerisle's majestic "" You did it beautifully! "" In reducing matters to a sexual, as opposed to a religious power - struggle, LaBute presents the flimsiest of qualifiers for a harvest sacrifice. Prior to this release, Neil LaBute had this to say about the 1973 original: "" It's surprising how many people say it's their favorite soundtrack. Summersisle's main export is honey â€“ a symbolic and literal headache for Edward, as he's allergic to bees."
6249,"If you want to see streetball just rent the And1 Mix Tape tours, even though they are a jumble of random moves, they are still better action then Crossover. The overall look and quality of the film resembled that of a mid-80's Egyptian soap opera dubbed into French. The on - the - court scenes contained lots of edits and cut - aways that marked staged shots."
6250,"The charismatic Cillian Murphy carries the movie, but the support from Liam Cunningham, Orla Fitzgerald, Aidan O'Hare and Padraic Delaney is also commendable. Another powerful movie from Ken Loach and a well deserved winner of the Palm D'or at Cannes. Some magical performances not only from the stars, but from the whole cast. This is a truly great film and well deserving of the Palm D'Or. Nothing could be further from the truth however as has been graphically illustrated by the reception given in Britain to Ken Loach's Palme d'or winning movie The Wind that Shakes the Barley."
6251,"The story is gripping and the cast is excellent - some of the finest British actors give star performances - in particular a stellar performance from Danny Dyer. There have been a few good British horror movies over the past few years, including most notably the likes of Dog Soldiers, Shaun of the Dead, Wilderness and The Descent. On a more serious note, there are some seriously scary scenes in the picture and even a couple of deaths of some of the more sympathetic characters that are actually quite moving. For the better part of a decade every British comedy or romance was hailed as' The funniest film since Four Weddings and a Funeral'. With Four Weddings' a distant memory, anything remotely amusing or linked with horror is now wrongly compared to Shaun of the Dead (or possibly Dog Soldiers)."
6252,"It is true that "" Hollywoodland "" takes occasional liberties with specific facts, in no less way than Shakespeare took liberties with the real life facts of Hamlet or Julius Caesar. And "" Hollywoodland "" does a superb job of portraying that essence, who George Reeves was, what his world was like, and what impact he had on those who knew him and those who only knew of him. Allen Coulter, the director, has done a splendid job capturing the era and has paid enormous attention both to period detail and to the details of the lives of the real - life characters. The performances of Larry Cedar, Bob Hoskins, and Lois Smith also stand out especially distinctively. The cinematography is stunning, with the frequent flashbacks clearly distinguishable from the "" present day "" scenes without the distinction being glaring or even obvious."
6253,"The special effects and the display of the supernatural powers are very well done, but after awhile they evoke yawns, and not excitement. Along the centuries, the power and the covenant are transmitted through their descendants and when the eldest son is eighteen years old, he ascends to a higher power. In the present days, four wizards teenage friends are in high school and their leader Caleb Danvers (Steven Strait) is close to his eighteenth birthday and consequently to ascend. The first born males descended from these families have supernatural powers, and must come to terms with the seductive, addictive nature of using those powers. Everyone did their jobs and all made believable teenagers."
6254,"In spite of its tragic and heartfelt content of a mother reconnecting with her 6 - year - old daughter after she has been released from prison, Sherrybaby moves back into realistic mode, and feels truly engaging because of it. Undoubtedly, Maggie Gyllenhaal's performance in the film reeks of Oscar - bait for it is simply an excellent performance. Certainly all performances in the film hold up pretty well. All the interactions between the characters follow the theme of the film; it is realistic. To truly appreciate Ms. Gyllenhaal beyond her famed role opposite James Spader in d - Steven Shainberg's "" Secretary "" 2002 (screenplay by Erin Cressida Wilson), one really should watch her in "" SherryBaby . """
6255,A lot of things in this futuristic satire are more theoretically funny than actually funny (though it does have some laugh - out - loud moments) but a lot of that is because it seems to have been cut by the studio to better appeal to exactly the idiots it's mocking.
6258,"The acting is absolutely superb, but then it's got Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. Weisz has the depth for regal intrigue and spirited grace. The use of micro-photography made the visual effects gorgeous. It's like a timeless poem in that it deserves to be revisited, both in viewings and in conversation. Aronofsky lights these scenes with very specific soft golden lights, which place most of the setting in blackness and create an eerie, melancholy atmosphere."
6260,"There's something magical about this wonderfully sweet romantic fantasy by Michael Gondry. This is Gondry's immense visual world unrestrained by a script by Charlie Kaufman, and this world of fancy and imagination is where the film flourishes. Michel Gondry, the visually creative giant behind some of MTV's most stylistically innovative music videos, and more recently the driving force behind his and script writer extraordinare Charlie Kaufman's brilliant Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, finally makes his solitary debut, choosing to write and direct this surrealist tale of dreams, reality, and the lines some people walk between them. Much like last year's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, where it was unfiltered Shane Black on the screen; The Science of Sleep is pure Gondry from start to finish. Regardless of it's constant French avant - garde noodling, and despite the obvious parallels to Gondry's previous film, Science remains a near - masterwork, punctuated by the intoxicating rhythm of it's perceptive dream sequences, often edited with the most keen of intentions."
6261,"A dinner scene between a suspect and her family had the crowd in stitches (the only scene during which the audience laughed). This is lightweight film noir that will will send most viewers back to the video store to rent the DVD of "" LA Confidential "", an excellent adaptation of another Elroy novel. It has all the trappings of a first - rate detective novel (James Ellroy) made into a 1940's thriller with appropriately moody music of the soulful trumpet (Mark Isham), lush production design (Dante Ferretti), and equally impressive costuming (Jenny Beavan), all set in a timelessly seedy Los Angeles. Dante Ferretti's set design beautifully evokes the 1940's; Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography enhances the period look; and the voice - over narration has been pulled from film - noir classics. While Brian De Palma's "" The Black Dahlia "" has much of the look and feel of Curtis Hanson's 1997 "" L. A. Confidential, "" that far superior film boasted better performances and a well - written screenplay."
6262,"But while this movie was probably aimed for the kids, it seemed like the writer was maybe expecting like another Shrek or The Incredables, where the whole family could enjoy it, but it ended up being just a kid's flick. Yankee's dad is fired from Yankee Stadium, he's the janitor, so it was his job to make sure that everything was secure. Yet its because he's the perfect evil force to Yankee Irving's hero that you continue to watch, just so you can see him get his just desserts. This is the first of the lot that really should have been made into 3D."
6265,"Actual footage of several jumpers is shown in the midst of interviews with loved ones trying to make sense out of the senseless. The interviews and deaths are intertwined with montage of beautiful shots of the bridge showing it as a very romantic setting, not too dissimilar to the Humber Bridge in Hessle (near Hull), England - which is also notoriously known for it's high suicide rates, but what the Humber estuary lacks is the sheer awe of the surrounding landscape and slightly better achievements of engineering. The witnesses interviewed in the film, including some of the jumper's parents and close family, are very brave to give their thoughts and opinions as to why they believe the jumpers committed the final act. But he made good footage, from the opening shots; tall, slim, clad in black leather, long black hair with black sunglasses, 35 yrs old, standing looking out over the rails at the water, making final phone calls, pacing restively, the camera actually following his feet as he walks his final steps through the rails. On the one hand, there are many visually alluring shots of the golden gate bridge, shot at different speeds (sometimes regular, sometimes at 16 or less FPS to give it that faster edge), sometimes in a great fog or looking at the cars, from below, and in a constant long lens that peers onto everyone on the bridge, just regular passer - by or one contemplating the end of one's life, like anything could happen next since it is, in fact, strikingly idyllic."
6505,"Nader holds, as the film shows, that any independent candidate who knuckles under when the final push to election time begins and throws in his support to the democratic candidate is telling the Republicans and Democrats that they can do whatever they want. "" An Unreasonable Man "" provides a generous helping of archival footage to go along with the passionate interviews on both sides of the Nader spectrum (the movie does not, however, provide any real conservative voices, except for Patrick Buchanan, who, on many issues is actually more aligned with Nader's positions than opposed to them). Keep your cell phones turned off and your mind open when watching this critically important film. Its so fast - paced, information packed, emotional, exciting, engaging, enRaging, and occasionally hilarious that when seeing it in a movie theater you should buckle your seatbelts! Love him or loathe him, this is a fantastically interesting and informative documentary about one of the most influential figures of the last hundred years."
6292,The book has so many descriptions in it you may lose the story at some point but the movie keeps right on trucking. All the great outdoors are at her finger tips.
6268,"The most remarkable performances by an ensemble cast of unknowns. Even if you had political reasons you did not like The Passion - or Braveheart for that matter - if you like a good motion picture Apocalypto is a good bet. Mel Gibson obviously has some major demons but maybe that is what makes him such a masterful storyteller. Apocalypto is his latest and IMO his greatest film, this film plays out like the bastard freak brother of the Fugitive, it is wildly entertaining and violently sick, it also is an allegory of todays society. The images in this film are breathtaking, shot with the genesis digital cameras this is the best looking digital film out to date, the cinematography is superb, the costumes, make up and art direction are top notch."
6269,"Performances were good, and Jean Reno was great as the captain of the Lafayette Escadrille. There are no standout performances, and the syrupy, chaste romance goes nowhere. The love story ultimately goes nowhere, either, though James Franco and Jennifer Decker both turn in moving performances. The movie uses a composite of these qualities of the actual pilots, and yes, there really was a black pilot in the squadron. The Planes look magnificent, but could have been done better."
6270,"Like the first JackAss, this isn't so much a movie as an eighty minute long string of stunts and pranks. The stunts are over the top and the pranks are funnier and more outrageous than ever before. The original had a few notorious stunts, and there is at least one stunt that this movie will be remembered for. It's a lot of fun and should be a great comedic fix until the Borat movie comes out. Some of the funniest bits are the pranks the guys play on themselves, and they have no regard for what happens to them."
6271,"' Borat' is without a doubt one of the most original and ingenious comedy in the last three years, and maybe, just maybe, the funniest film ever made. As Borat travels through America, there is a wealth of juxtapositions to be found when he interacts with the people â€“ members of the white house, television broadcasters, etiquette teachers, Christian fundamentalists and Jews â€“ all offers layered hilarity and a consistent cloud of laughter kept hovering in the air. Some may call' Borat' the funniest film ever made, and that's not and understatement. Cohen, posing as these different characters would interview politicians and such who were unaware the interview was a joke. Da Ali G Show was an incredibly original variety / reality show featuring Cohen in three roles including Borat (whom is the main character of the movie)."
6272,"Brutal but beautiful, magical yet earthy, it has a remarkable cast, with standout performances all round. A special mention must go to Sergi Lopez, whose' Captain Vidal' is indeed one of the most sadistic film creations ever seen. Although dubbed, his Spanish is perfect (Jones speaks not a word of the language), and his physical presence is incredibly powerful as his character teases, cajoles and harries Ofelia to fulfil her tasks. But the cast is just one facet of this gloriously photographed film, with Javier Navarrete's hauntingly simple score weaving itself into the fabric of a film perfectly edited and written. The brutality of post-Civil War Spain contrasts with the world of magic to which Ofelia is drawn, yet everywhere she goes she has choices to make."
6273,"The animation was well done, the cast was great, and there were some very creative action scenes in this movie. Predictable kiddie fare with okay animation and some good throwaway moments here and there. Some of the sidekick critters are funny, though. All the actors who did voices did a terrific job. 5 on IMDb, because normally, most of the users are right about these movies."
6274,"Then there's the acting in which the lead actors (Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon) not only give stunningly entertaining performances, but you become engulfed in each one's perspective and dilemmas. This is the master behind such greats as Taxi Diver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and he's at it again. The film is perfectly set up with intense, suspense scenes while adding in amounts humor at times. DiCaprio really seemed to earn a lot of respect from this role. Sure it was known he was a good actor from his Oscar nominated performances in What's Eating Gilbert Grape and The Aviator, but he really takes it to another level here."
6275,"then it's just a virtual redo on the original with four likable 20 - somethings being captured and tortured by Leatherface and his family. Ermey is on hand giving another terrifying performance as Hoyt. If you want to watch a good old fashion blood and guts horror movie that delivers on the darkness, the atmosphere, the killing, all that makes a horror movie good (and not bad as is lost on most movie reviewers) then see TCM the beginning. It beats the heck out of the Japanese rip off PG - 13 flicks and it definitely beats most of the 90s horror departure from the excellent horror of the 80s film makers who weren't scared to show blood, guts, nudity etc. . There is an idiom about the way a human being feels pain â€” when a surge comes, it makes a brief period of time, sometimes only a matter of seconds, feel like an unbearable eternity."
6291,"In the style of Saving Private Ryan (Spielberg is a producer of Flags) the viewer gets a astounding look at war with a lot of blood, guts and CGI. Like his meditation on violence Unforgiven, Flags takes a closer look at heroism where soldiers by chance get into the spotlight of the war - propaganda - machine. While Flags appears choppy as it sets the stage, Eastwood manages to bring the story full circle giving it a sense of closure. People of all ages should see the film but a powerful movie for children to see with their parents, especially their fathers. In fact, the John Woo film focused more on Nicolas Cage's character than the always excellent Adam Beach."
6276,The story was great and there are many funny scenes in this movie that makes it cool to work at one of those stores. It doesn't have anything new to offer but some of the jokes work well and the sequences with Cook and Shepard competing against each other do make one chuckle. Zack's grandma is the funniest character. The thing that always makes workplace comedy the funniest is the truth of the situations the characters find themselves in.
6277,"And One Of The Most Exciting Part Of The Book Is The Quad Bike Chase, Thats Absent From The Film And Is a Real Let Down! Book adaptations rarely capture the excellence of the novel which they are based upon and though the same can be said for' Stormbreaker', it still is a rather good film considering the fact it is mainly aimed at the pre-teen and young teen audience. The film is reasonably watchable, probably because it only lasted 90 minutes. From the first minutes of the film, you know that you're in for a thrilling adventure. Alex Rider, played superbly by Alex Pettyfer, is very believable as a school kid thrown into the deep end by Bill Nighy who hams it up brilliantly as spymaster Alan Blunt."
6278,"Brian Cox, Joseph Cross, and a great Jill Clayburgh really were amazing. It's even more amazing when you realize it's based on what really happened to Augusten Burroughs. A wonderful story, and a wonder that Mr. Burroughs survived the reality. Gwynth Paltrow has a fun, small part, and it was good to see Kristin Chenowith on screen. Brian Cox, superb as the Dickensian know - it - all, his daughters, Evan Rachel Wood and the magnificent Gwynneth Paltrow who can tell you more with half a look than with two pages of exposition."
6279,"The little boy starts seeing a odd person whom is now living with the Flemings in the apartment down the hall acting very suspicious and he continues to be curious of that person, after many odd occurrences. Even though this part of the story arc ties in nicely the movie would have been better without it. Sure the whole movie doesn't make any sense until the 10 remaining minutes, but it makes you think. Welp, enjoy her two minutes of screen time and one line of dialogue. In Chicago, Trish (Jennifer Beals) moves to the apartment of her boyfriend Bill (Christopher Cousins), who lives with his children, the teenager Lacey (Sarah Roehmer) and boy Jake (Matthew Knight)."
6280,"After that episode aired, millions flocked to the web to create various petitions and voice their opinions on why Dobbs would make a great candidate for the President for the United States. (contains spoilers) Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) is a television talk show host gone political candidate; a Jon Stewart type that takes the plunge into contributing rather than heckling. (thought about the west wing debate when Tom Dobbs leaves his podium, thought about Steven Colbert announcing his candidacy, good times) The first 15 - 20 minutes of this movie are therefore very very entertaining, the debate especially. The supporting actors give great performances, especially Laura Linney and Chris Walken. It is similar to Barry Levinsons other comedies, funny but also has some deep drama."
6281,"Just sit back and enjoy some great explosions, fighting scenes and snappy comic remarks. WWE champion John Cena makes his acting debut in WWE Films' "" The Marine "". The Marine is just a silly film by WWE simply to entertain it's fan base and further it's empire. After intense fighting scenes, the characters didn't have scratches or torn clothing. The fight sequences are great, very intense, very hardcore, but the explosions and special effects are brutally unrealistic and cheesy."
6282,"Moritz Bleibtreu is excellent and the character really displays how the complexity of a human being can cause you to both hate and pity him. That's very welcome because Houellebecque is notorious for his polemical discussions, something that would be very hard to fit on a movie or entertainment television. It keeps things simple and offers viewers only the "" story "" of the two brothers, keeping the more hardcore stuff on the books. At the bottom, maybe the best introduction to Houellebecque's world. Second, because of a certain frankness and urgency that Houellebecq brought to this work (his subsequent books became more and more formulaic, right down to the unaccepatable "" Platform "")."
6283,"Given the pedigree of its director, Jafar Panahi, it was disarming to discover that Offside is a comedy, and a frequently hilarious one. In 1997's The Mirror, Panahi presents two versions of Iranian girlhood and leaves the audience to wonder which one is "" real "". As the women demand to know why they can't watch the soccer match and their captors struggle to answer, the only possible outcome is comedy. What makes Offside most affecting is that the young women are not portrayed as activists attacking the system. They are simply soccer fans and patriots, and despite the fact that they are clearly being treated unfairly, they never lose their focus on the match and the historic victory that is within their nation's grasp."
6145,"The time line is fairly stable and simple to follow--except parts of the end--which makes for an enjoyable experience. The depths she would go to, to stay youthful and the harm she put on to so many girls. For what it is, this movie rocks! Samaire Armstrong actually gives an okay performance though a little too bland to truly stick out. Frankie Muniz probably gives the best performance in Stay Alive."
6284,"The scenes between characters have you nailed to your seat and deeply invested. This accepting is what separates little children from adults, immature from mature. The tale is moving, sad, hilarious, dark, breathtaking, thought - provoking and many other creative adjectives. Haley sneaks onto the screen 45 minutes into the narrative bursting the happy bubble of familiar ups and downs of married with children life. Haley deserves accolades, praise and loads of attention."
6285,"This thoughtful documentary by Ms. Berg will tear at your heart as you view it. If you are a fan of "" Silence of the Lambs, "" you should see this because Oliver O'Grady is just as chilling as Hannibal Lecter--more so because he is real. At the same time, the film is a profile of some incredibly decent people: Catholic parents and children who were victims in this rampage. Their character is inspiring--their pain is as raw as anything you will ever see on film. The victims and their families rage with intense, fresh pain despite the decades."
6286,"It's interesting how 90% of the high - vote reviews are all comprised of "" * random username * "" from "" United States "" (no state pride?) The Bottom Line: For the hardcore conservative Christian Parents crowd lamenting the evils of Hollywood, Facing The Giants will be another mediocre - at - best Christian film to hold up on a pedestal as the preferred model for modern film - making. Someone should have made this movie before 10 of the 11 apostles were killed for following Jesus."
6287,"Macavoy's character is so real. Go ahead and hide your eyes during the "" tough "" scenes. A freshly graduated young doctor Nicolas from Scotland went to Uganda in 1970s hoping that he could offer his helping hands to the Ugandan people. When Amin learns Nicholas is a Scot, he takes off his military shirt complete with medals and trades it on the spot for a "" Scotland "" T - shirt Nicolas is wearing--for his son, Campbell. Macdonald - whose previous works are documentaries, including the Oscar - winning "" One Day in September, "" about the Munich Olympics terrorist incident - looks at Amin through the eyes of a young Scottish doctor (James McAvoy), a well - meaning, honest humanitarian slowly seduced by the Scots - loving Amin, who appoints him his personal doctor and then adviser."
6288,"The scenes of teenagers burning their Beatles records in protest of his quip that the Beatles had become more popular than Jesus, are eerily parallel with the Dixie Chicks fans who did the same thing. Triggered in no small part by his meeting with Yoko Ono, a conceptual artist obsessed with breaking down barriers, Lennon had to decide if there was a greater purpose to which he could devote his musical talent, fame and fortune. Directors Leaf and Scheinfeld are past masters at making serious pop culture retrospectives. There are interviews with high - ranking former government and FBI agents. They weren't doing it to promote anything except peace and that's what makes them heroic artists here."
6289,"The superb cast of characters of John Cameron Mitchell's "" Shortbus "" powerfully draws the viewer in to each of the characters' lives and problems. Unlike "" 9 Songs, "" which seemed to focus on 1/8 of the full human experience of relationships (concerts and sex), Mitchell's "" Shortbus "" approaches 9/10 of the authentic experience of being human, being miserable, looking to come to joy, and exploring funny, sensual, and affectionate avenues to get there. What everyone will hear about "" Shortbus "" is that the sex is real and explicit. Mitchell, as a gay man, obviously has an understanding of gay relationships, and the storyline with the three gay lovers is handled beautifully. Because one's comfort level with their sexuality mirrors how one relates in all other relationships, showing the raw and carnal aspect of each character so explicitly works beautifully to accurately convey their motivations and struggles."
6290,"The workings of the complicated illusions are gorgeously brought to life via smartly detailed apparatus that replicate the actual mechanics of Victorian legerdemain. Much of the film rings very true, such as the all - consuming obsessions of the lead characters to be the best and outdo all others. The story, though adapted from a novel, feels like a perfect fit for director Nolan's sensibilities, as the machinations of the two men become increasingly convoluted during a back - and - forth tug of wits that keeps you guessing in the style of Nolan's "" Memento . "" Solid performances are all around, with Michael Caine adding dignity and depth as the old master, Scarlett Johanssen as the as the lovely stage assistant who becomes the third point in a twisted love triangle, and even Andy Serkis (Gollum!) This transition is a hard note to pull off, since the beginning of the film doesn't quite suggest such a direction, but if you're willing to let Nolan lead you on the journey into increasingly fantastic realms, the narrative rewards you with thought - provoking moral and dramatic exploration of the issues raised."
6293,""" Sleeping Dogs "" is a sweet little indie romantic comedy about what happens to a nice girl when she admits to her fiancÃ© that she once gave her pet dog a blow job. Yes, "" Sleeping Dogs "" is a little rough around the edges (the lack of budget shows), but the performances are spot on and the script (dealing with serious questions about secrecy and honesty and how much somebody really needs to know about you before it starts to hurt them) is a little gem. Black comedy cut from the same cloth as the Todd Solondz movies "" Happiness "" and "" Storytelling "". Its good to see something so original coming out of Hollywood, with so many blockbusters to compete with, a little indie yarn is a welcome change. It deals with love fidelity, and the value and pitfalls of secrets and honesty."
6294,"Reminiscent of Larry Clark's Kids in Manhattan, it depicts adolescents growing up in a tough neighbourhood, in the borough of Queens. As Dito makes the journey across the continent to visit the ill father he hasn't seen in 15 years, a montage of childhood memories flood his mind. The performances in the film are strong. Melonie Diaz, who previously appeared in Raising Victor Vargas, beautifully portrayed Dito's childhood girlfriend Laurie. Producer Robert Downey Jr. who encouraged Montiel to make the film, was excellent in an understated role as the adult Dito."
6295,"The thrill and suspense of the challenges faced in the original Saw replaced with ideas designed to do nothing more than test how well you could hold onto your last meal. But any episode in a good series should be able to stand on it's own without _ needing _ the prior episodes to work. After enduring the first 20 minutes of blood and guts the storyline of the movie started to develop, but it was hard to actually connect with it as there was the constant fear that the next second another disembowelment or similar would jar you out of the storyline again. Loved the gore, loved the traps (although they were a bit much in this version, and unfortunately there weren't many actual traps, just some excess eye candy lying about the workshops and scenes of instruments of terror.) Like the 2 movies before it, difficult decisions and some nasty secrets become a part of a much larger plan."
6506,""" Tekkonkinkreet "", literally translated as reinforced concrete, is an hypnotic experience set upon the kaleidoscopic drop of some truly gorgeous drawings which tells the tale of two street urchins as they do battle with an array of colourful characters in order to defend their city from being taken over. Tekkonkinkreet successfully delivers on appeasing any and all who are looking for high quality hand drawn animation which surpasses the eternally vapid conveyor belt of repetitiveness that is Pixar, but it also delivers on being more than just a "" fighting "" film. The intrinsic parts of Tekkonkinkreet prove in being the messages the director and original creator are wishing to convey to their audiences, of which there are two major points. Treasure Town is a gloriously colourful island sitting sedately in the centre of a river yet its buildings and inhabitants for all their grandeur seem incredibly outdated. Treasure Town isn't exactly a time warp but you could be forgiven for thinking so, it is a place contented in its own time, but for the Yakuza this is not acceptable as they wish to bring Treasure Town forward into the 21st Century, to update the scenery, to turn it into a money making venture of epic proportions."
6297,"The level of detail is amazing and it's going to take many viewings and many hours with the DVD on pause to spot them all. Like the best family films, Flushed Away appeals to audiences of all ages, but the very young might find it a bit long. The performances are spot on and everyone is obviously having a tongue in cheek good time. The little slugs singing on the side are cute in their own way too. Chicken Run had great reviews as well."
6298,"Tom Tykwer beautifully achieves to always put the audience in the right mood, with the help of an amazing soundtrack and great camera work. The story and the film may have their flaws, but they also have outstanding qualities and in a perfect world Tom Tykwer should receive an award for his superb adaptation of the splendid book by Patrick SÃ¼sskind. The actors, especially Whishaw who plays Grenouille, have done a very good job. all roles are perfectly cast, the music, the camera, everything fits together like a perfect jigsaw puzzle. Although much of the story is told by a narrative voice (mostly quotes from the novel), the movie is still thrilling and exciting all the way."
6299,"The only funny stuff in this movie was the bloopers. But if you liked the other movies, go see this one; it's not as action packed, it's a little sappy, but it's clean fun and you'll laugh if you let yourself! The story is fine, a nice pleasant easy to follow plot with help from some nice additions to the cast, especially Alan Arkin as Santa's father - in - law. It's very hard to compete with the excellent first 2 movies. Tim Allen was perfect as Santa and Mrs. Santa is lovely."
6300,"This incredible true story mixes glamor, humor, great music and current events in a way that lets the facts speak for themselves. Here's a perfect example of why you have to take the IMDb rating system with a grain of salt--many of the people who hate the Dixie Chicks because they made an anti-Bush comment will give a rating of 1, even if they haven't seen the film. While one can understand how the Nixon gov' t objected to Lennon's peace activism, it's frightening to consider how a seemingly innocuous remark by the Dixie Chicks would turn into an organized campaign by the religious right in the U. S. that would lead to their CDs being burned, country radio stations refusing to play their songs, and the absence of support (if not open hostility) from the country music industry. Hopefully this will open some people's eyes. You see this dangerous radical snuggling into the cushions like a ten year old or lounging around like a trailer park diva, but then you listen to what she's saying and her courage is just overwhelming."
6301,"It is a brave, and ultimately, a rewarding choice for a director who has built his impeccable reputation on the strength of his mockumentaries. Like its predecessors Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show, and A Mighty Wind, For Your Consideration is largely improvised, and reunites the same winning cast. Half the fun of course is waiting for all the familiar faces to show up, and discovering what crazy character they have inhabited this time around. Insecurities, foibles - and just a few quirks - are in full display. Mike McKean and Bob Balaban are a fun team as the cowriters of Home for Purim, the movie - within - the - movie."
6490,"The Scream series made fun of the horror film in general, this movie pretended the killers in those films were real and makes fun of how stupid victims can be and how predictable the sequences are in a slasher situation. This is what the horror genre needs, people who make fun camp movies. Where "" Scream "" made fun of some ridiculous horror clichÃ©s and toyed around with them, "" Behind The Mask "" is merely explaining just how those seemingly supernatural killers are able to work so effectively. There have been very similar movies made in this vein, such as MAN BITES DOG and in some respects THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, but the best and most effective examples of this sub-genre have always come from overseas. Leslie Vernon, a highly - enthusiastic wannabe "" supernatural "" serial killer, along the lines of Halloween's Michael Meyers or Friday the 13th's Jason, invites a film crew along to document his initial spree this original horror comedy that allows you to see a killing spree from the point of view of the killer."
6475,"Most Romanians (and East - Europeans alike) will understand it very well, since many clichÃ©s are present here: the vain, non-professional media, the desolate streets, the people without perspectives or hope, the arrogant new - rich former secret service people, the successful immigrants coming from even lesser parts of the world. Virgil Jderescu (Teodor Corban), an entrepreneur who has prospered in the post-revolution free market era and now counts the local television channel among his assets, decides to devote his personal talk show today to commemorating the anniversary of the week - long revolution. Jderescu, the TV station's owner and talk - show host, a men that keeps statues of Plato and Aristotle on his bookcase, a host that starts his show with pretentious quotes from Heraclit and gets offended when his former job, as a production engineer, gets mentioned, well, Jderescu does not have a Christmas tree. What Mr. Porumboiu gave to the world was a rich story, interesting characters and presenting the question of a revolution. 12: 08 EAST OF BUCHAREST deserves all the accolades awarded it at Cannes, and Corneliu Porumboiu's amusing, entertaining and important film is a great window into the questions of the "" Romanian Revolution ""."
6304,"From the black and white pre-titles, to arguably the best titles sequence ever. From the African free - running chase to the beautiful interiors of London. The decision to make a 21st Century version of Fleming's first Bond novel - and, beyond the update, to remain true to the novel, sans comic patter, sans sci - fi techno - schtick, sans major rewrite of the basic plot - promised to present Bond fans of all ages with a direct challenge."
6305,"The way it's made is incredibly cinematic, and, at its heart, tells a great mythic story: an outcast leaves his community and journeys to the edge of the world to find a way to end the famine that's plaguing his species. The sad - sack penguin is then drummed out of the penguin corps, shunned for his lack of song and strength of feet, and he runs into another penguin colony, one that uses pebbles to woo their females instead of song, and makes new friends - a Latino - sounding quartet that's high on life, full of zest and pizazz and charisma, everything that Mumble's old group isn't. The character voices from Robin Williams, Elijah Wood, Hugh Jackman, and others was perfectly matched to their characterizations."
6306,"His editor better be making some good money as these films fly by with filters, jump - cuts, grain, and camera angles swiveling at every turn. Greatly overshadowed by brother Ridley Scott and his more serious, award - winning epics, Tony has been pumping out some of the most solid and entertaining films of the past couple decades. With a reuniting of semi-regular star Denzel Washington, DÃ©jÃ  Vu proves that when Bruckheimer is paired with a like mind, his usual drivel can become great. The far - fetched premise of being able to see the past as it happens four and a half days later should seem crazy and by watching the previews you are given the idea that it will be just a series of do - overs. The beauty of this film is that with multiple timelines being shown parallel to each other, there are many questions that desperately need answering."
6307,"Like in all great ensemble movies, "" Bobby "" offers a stellar cast, none of whom disappoint. The subtle colorful hues reflect the emotional grip of each scene, and extenuate a modern feel to the film. And what works for this type of film - making is the amount of anticipation it builds up, and even after pivotal scenes, the impact it leaves on the audience. This little description is about the only real history you will get from this mishmash of a film, which soon meanders off into a wildly - spinning series of unrelated concoctions; very loosely tied to the upcoming assassination. Then take a look at some of the vignettes: Anthony Hopkins (portraying another old American) is a longtime hotel employee who now plays chess with an addled Harry Belafonte; Estevez (wearing an ascot and carrying a poodle) is the effeminate husband of drunken singer Demi Moore; Heather Graham is a hotel switchboard operator having an affair with aging manager William H. Macy (the biggest work of fiction in the whole movie); Macy, on the other hand fires kitchen manager Christian Slater for racism, but is chastised himself by beautician wife, Sharon Stone, for infidelity; long - winded cook, Laurence Fishburne, lectures everyone on the meaning of life; two Mormon missionary - types, Shia LeBeouf and Brian Geraghty, who work for the Kennedy campaign, buy LSD from Ashton Kutcher; Helen Hunt and Martin Sheen play a middle - aged couple who come to celebrate the primary; and Lindsey Lohan is a woman who marries Elijah "" Frodo "" Wood to keep him from going to Vietnam."
6308,"Paz Vega, his co-star, gets a career boost and Brad Silberling gets a name to draw people into watching his movie. Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are the mismatched pair who get in the car and go about doing errands according to the need of one or the other. And heck, sometimes, it's worth the price of admission to vicariously live them, 82 minutes at a time. Still looking like Penelope Cruz's Amazonian sister, the beautiful Vega (one of the few redeemable aspects of James L. Brooks' execrable "" Spanglish "") brings a stinging edge and realistic vulnerability to Scarlet. He takes particular interest in the cashier at the "" 10 Items or Less "" lane (Paz Vega), who he finds an amiable, strong, and curious presence."
6309,"All those' If Only .Â .Â .' emotions telling you there is a lovely place somewhere in which people fall in love and everything works out kinda perfect. They escape lovelorn predicaments and find' unexpected' love on their opposite sides of the Atlantic. Cue enormous L. A. mansion with swimming pool (just the way Brits imagine it). Since she's played the same comedy character several times, there are few surprises; but an excellent script, written directly for her and the other three leading stars, projects it rather better than average. Formulaic it is (wonderful women with scoundrelly fellas eventually get The Real Men They Deserve - meeting puppy dogs, children, and falling snowflakes on the way of course)."
6474,"The quality of the acting (especially from Cluzet) and the dialogue, no doubt helped by Coben's writing, keeps the story believable as everyman Beck races ever closer to the truth, and to round it off, the score is great too, with clever use of familiar tracks to help keep the audience somewhat comfortable as Beck's search becomes more and more dangerous. The casting of this couple was crucial as for all its twists and turns what follows is essentially their love story; and neither Cluzet nor Croze disappoint - the latter possessing a perfect vulnerable quality (akin to Naomi Watts in' King Kong'). Although Cluzet carries the movie, the rest of the cast, which contains a number of very distinguished French actors, is first - rate. Based on the best selling novel by Harlan Coben this is how a thriller should be made. Canet respected very well Coben's work and the cast is absolutely excellent!"
6311,"If you enjoy what you see to the degree that you'd sit through the show for ninety minutes, than check this film out. With a wonderfully coherent storyline tying in almost all aspects of the traditional "" D "" history and hallmarks, great new songs, hilarious comedy, and some pretty awesome cameos, this movie ranks up there with the best! So much over-the-top fun and the songs are so catchy. If your are old enough to remember when Heavy Metal dominated the music scene in the eighties you are going to love this film. Jack Black is an amazingly talented comedian and actor and assuming he really wrote and performed the songs in this film he is also a talented musician."
6312,"If only the respected film institutions representing and honouring Western cinema appreciated such inspiring and ground - breaking work. Much of their work previously ignored, hopefully this film will elevate them to greater things and Oscars are surely looming."
6313,"It had an OK script, OK actors, cool scenes, a fun plot, and gruesome gore. ' Turistas' was a fun horror flick with a' Hostel' like plot. It had some good gory scenes which included a disturbing open surgery scene. Although the film runs out of steam towards the end and spends a bit too much time underwater, it is, nevertheless, a very decent horror pic set in an exotic milieu and enhanced by some gruesome, realistic scenes of violence. When the chase scenes and violence were actually viewable (of which it rarely was) it actually was pretty intense."
6314,"Djiman Housou has enormous physical presence as the brave Mende fisherman. For others it is the hope of escape from a life of hell. Caught in the middle of it all are the children who have such little desire to kill for any reason that they must be brainwashed into becoming the instruments of their masters who claim to offer freedom. Every few years an action movie comes along that has amazing depth. The paths that some relationships take to develop trust are believable, while others are equally believable in remaining eternally antagonistic."
6315,"It is uncomplicated, and has a simple message, but is engaging enough for both children and adults. The story is close to the children's book but a couple of goofy crows are added with the voices of Thomas Haden Church and Andre Benjamin. for good family entertainment, Charlotte's Web is the perfect counter to any heavy story lines from those other movies! Children of all ages should be thrilled by talking animals and a charming storyline by E. B. White. If you want high drama this year, go see Apocalypto, or Blood Diamond."
6316,"If only to watch the stellar performance of the excellent British actor, Jeremy Irons as he mentors the wet - behind - the - ears Dragon Rider, the film is worth watching as the really ugly bad guys try to bring down the last of the dragons and her headstrong partner. The special effects are fine but the story is rather hammy and the performances are not very good. Only bright side of the movie is always top - of - the - class John Malkovich (King Galbatorix), pretty solid performance by Jeremy Irons (Brom), but most of all dragon Saphira (voice by Rachel Weisz, whose vocal abilities are on very desirable level) But those are two experienced actors that will give good performances regardless. Jeremy Irons makes an grant effort with what he has to work with but he's let down by the script and the bad performances of his co-stars and the only solid piece of real acting comes from the voice over work of Rachel Weisz, who gives the dragon Saphira enough charm, charisma, and strong will to make her the only believable and likable character in the entire film."
6317,"The movie is inspiring --- the winning quality in all Rocky movies. Just to recap to the earlier movies for the moment, in the original ROCKY, in some sort of bizarre publicity stunt Rocky Balboa was plucked up from a short list of "" bum of the month contenders "" to leap frog genuine challengers for a crack at the undisputed heavy weight title. It's slow in certain areas particularly at the beginning but over all a nostalgic effort which tried to capture the theme of the earlier rocky movies. In this movie Mason Dixon to a large extent returns the heavyweight champion to a more believable human role, although contemporary for 2006 i. e. athletic, brash and mean! The question in this movie is actually more like a Rocky Marciano v's Ali now than it was in the 70's!"
6319,"What this film offers the fortunate viewer that many other movies of its kind do not, are lead characters you can actually empathize with and grow to care about. The impressive skill that Ms. Watts and Mr. Norton bring to their work truly makes you believe that that the first challenge - combating cholera amid colonial unrest and nationalist hostilities is easier than the task of repairing a damaged marriage, and with each uneasy glance and every unsaid word, you feel what these two people feel. Beautiful scenery and costumes, a cast of thousands, and enough background information to make you feel you are more educated about a time and place than you were before you saw the movie. The movie's tagline - "" Sometimes the greatest journey is the distance between two people "" succinctly points to the heart of this film, and what makes it work so well; the journey of a couple who married for the wrong reasons towards true intimacy with each other. Mr. Norton is wonderful as the quietly simmering bacteriologist who lacks interpersonal skills and warmth until the tragic environment brings about self - discovery."
6321,"The Good Sheperd doesn't insult your intelligence, it stimulates it, sometimes confuses it, and forces you to look several layers beneath the surface. De Niro took a page from his producer's best work, Francis Ford Coppola, emulating films like The Godfather, The Conversation and Apacalypse Now. The scope of the film is enormous, yet the point of view is narrowly focused to be seen through the eyes of one man. Shepherd follows the life of Edward Wilson (Damon) through his college years at Yale to his ascension as one of the CIA's founding officers and trusted veterans. This, as well as a depiction of the result of Wilson's decision, are just two of the moments of brilliance in The Good Shepherd."
6322,"Condon has created a vivid, emotional spectacle that will dominate the 06/07 Oscar nominations. Dreamgirls is one of the five best movie musicals ever made. But thats what works so well for the film - the great cinematic clichÃ©s are embraced and played to the hilt by a creative team, both behind and in front of the camera, that knows what makes a great Hollywood musical. Condon's camera is in love with Beyonce Knowles and she handles the journey from the innocence of the groups early years to the staggering success and fortune of the group at its peak with surprising range. While most singer / actress attempts are failures (Madonna, Whitney, Britney, k. d. lang), Beyonce proves to have genuine talent."
6143,"The world of competitive spelling bees has always been a hard subject to dramatize. It is undoubtedly a fascinating subject to behold, one which requires large amounts of both intelligence and strategy. But as the months pass, her bond with Larabee grows along with her ambition. With her entire neighborhood behind her, Akeelah must decide if she has what it takes to win. Akeelah And The Bee greatly benefits from the excellent script, which takes careful time to develop the characters - allowing you to become very attached to them by the end of the film."
6325,"Thank you Spike and all the people at 40 Acres and a Mule for doing what had to be done - recording the real story. Spike Lee has made his most powerful work yet with "" When The Levees Broke "". The purity of the depiction is very refreshing, free of the overbearingly pompous moral platitudes of someone like Michael Moore. It is always compulsive viewing, and while the subject matter is impossibly dark, it does show some wonderful flashes of human strength and positivity that provide some hope. Lawful citizens who have paid years of tax and insurance, building a livelihood out of nothing with their bare hands, are told they will get nothing - theft and fraud on a grand scale."
6326,"It is also one of the self - referential moments of the film that explores the audiences very thoughts while providing some comic relief. Her range and ability to work consistently over so many years and under the conditions of this film is mind blowing. It also has some truly surreal moments of Lynch humor. His freedom in making this movie, both with medium and artistic control, is unparalleled in anything he's done. David Lynch, the visionary director who created unforgettable films revealing darker realms of life such as "" Elephant Man "" and "" Blue Velvet "" and who brought to mainstream TV a deeper aesthetic and consciousness with the "" Twin Peaks "" series, unfortunately went overboard with "" Inland Empire "" writing and directing the worst film of his career."
6327,"The existing teachers are the testy, frank Mrs. Lintott (a fine Frances de la Tour) and the massively obese Hector (Richard Griffiths in a stunning performance) who teaches' general studies', a time when he lovingly coaxes the boys to embrace poetry, music, sentimentality, drama, art, and in general everything that allows them to take the moment and live it fully. It's Sheffield, early 1980s, and eight talented students have achieved top grades at A-level and have Oxbridge in their sights. Proud of this but, more importantly, out to capitalize on the enhanced prospects for the school's future that could follow if all eight are accepted into Oxford or Cambridge, the Headmaster hires a special tutor to prepare the boys for the exams. The boys are dissimilar types but all are energized as only high spirited adolescents can be. British playwright / screenwriter Alan Bennett, whose scintillating wit first surfaced in his contributions to the 1960 satiric stage revue, "" Beyond the Fringe, "" wrote "" The History Boys, "" a play set in the early 1980s about English secondary school students and their teachers, academic competition and the purpose of education, and the chaotic developments of adolescent sexuality and coming of age."
6328,"The film starts innocuously enough, with the two women becoming fast friends, with Blanchett inviting Dench into her home and family, and Dench all too eager to find a new best friend. Deliciously seasoned with spicy subtexts involving the bourgeois sense of entitlement, the bitterness of the lower middle class, the candidness of those with everything who never seem to be satisfied, the resentment of those sucked into this confidence, and of course, the psycho - sexual entrapments of all relationships, "" Notes on a Scandal "" is rife with everyday tragedy. In the early scenes where Dench is describing her burgeoning fascination with Blanchett, the audience shares in the allure as Dench paints beautifully the appeal of Blanchett's talents as an actress. Director Richard Eyre (who previously directed Dench in the superb "" Iris "") structures the film in a crisp clip. There's also a sense of a symbolic passing of the torch from one generation of great actresses to the next."
6329,"Despite the millions of chrysanthemum flowers, ten thousand soldiers and three prominent male cast (Chow Yun Fatt, Jay Chou and Liu Ye), one thing will capture your attention."
6330,"All his co-workers are nice and polite to him, they say hi and smile when they pass by him. Original, artistic directing is usually missing in norwegian films, with only a few exceptions. Everything is neat, pleasant - well, just nice. After being dropped off in the middle of nowhere, mid-thirties Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag) starts a new job as a book - keeper in a small, clean city. He doesn't know where he came from anymore, but still remembers rich tastes, true feelings - anything beyond the non-committal flatline life he's leading now."
6331,"The Congressman is not just a boob but a participant in the propagation of evil and the Good American General of Beau Bridges is anything but good. Even the lawyer Teitel, the man researching the Nuremberg Trials, whose sole purpose is to pursue Justice, can be compromised. Apart from the sex and swearing, the actors seem straight jacketed into their roles by the 40's styling seemingly because the script lacks any of the dry wit and charm you'd find in a genuine movie of this era."
6332,"It was worth it for producer / director Clint Eastwood to tackle on a second part to his now two - part duo of Iwo Jima movies. Later during the trip, speaking with Japanese friends and seeing the Japanese news, stories of lost loved ones from the war were common and this movie for the Japanese people has brought many of these memories out in the open."
6333,"sense of humour, some very nice looking actresses in it! The Christmas theme is taken advantage of here, and the set decoration within the sorority house is wonderful (lights, wreaths, decorations everywhere) - this movie reeks holiday scenery, which is nice. But there are some very funny lines thrown in here (lots of dark humor can be found in this movie as well) and some clever humorous moments (which, while they entice the viewer to take the movie less seriously, provide for a funner experience). It has it's fair share of problems (and had the potential to be a much better movie in terms of suspense and genuine scariness), but it will always remain a fun little horror movie to watch when the season rolls around. It's an entertaining movie (and contains some touches that make it stand out from most), so enjoy it for what it is - just don't expect it to be anywhere near as serious (or scary) as the original, because in that respect, the two films are very different."
6369,"The real Edie Sedgwick was a person whose hystrionics and drugs were symptoms of a soul that was always trying to fly away, for her the world was always too small and her pain was always too big, and she lived her life as though she dreamed of having her wings singed flying too close to the sun. Director George Hickenlooper's best work has been "" Mayor of Sunset Strip "" and "" Dogtown "", neither of which drew much of an audience. The film is overly choppy in attempting to find the right look and feel and yet with Jagger, Velvet Underground and the Dylanesque Hayden Christensen, the importance and power of music for this era is clearly established. The weakness of the film is best shown by the interviews over the closing credits. With her big raccoon eyes, pre-punk hairdo and flashing smile, Miller bears such a striking resemblance to the real - life Sedgwick that she carries much of the film by the sheer will of her character's Holly Golightly - like sense of exalted self - worth."
6334,"In an effort to bring Potter's experiences with the books to life on the screen, Noonan incorporates a series of technically adept animation sequences. Performances are what one would expect from so seasoned a cast, with Zellweger bringing her natural cherubic quality to the role of the author. Production design (by Martin Childs), which incorporates a color palette that matches Potter's work, and cinematography by Andrew Dunn ("" History Boys, "" "" Mrs. Henderson "") are elegant but not ostentatious, and are reminiscent of the look of "" Finding Neverland, "" another film set in turn - of - the - century England. Peter Rabbit and Co. are part of everybody's childhood and it brings back a lot of memories. --- are sweet, and totally in line with the original paintings she made 100 years ago."
6335,"The violence was minimal and well - handled (vague battle scenes), the scary parts not over-the-top scary, and the light touch with the romance was appreciated by the mom of a pre-pre-teen. Though the backdrop of the story were presented in real world (verses animation), the main adventure and action took place in a fantasy realm done in computer animations. Some may find the plot defies logic and common sense because of the realistic premises. Still there are nice touches in detail here and there that give the characters the kind of Charm and personality you may not find in the usual Hollywood characters. In the process, it takes you on a magical ride that filled with wonders and unexpected laughters."
6336,"It was great listening to him tell cousin Stiffler that he was at the school hanging out, because he's an alumni. Girls love virgins and inexperienced guys 9. It stands on its own and really, the only tie in is the Stiffler name."
6338,"A deceptively simple, in fact richly nuanced, subtle film about two old college chums, now in their 30s, who go on a weekend camping trip and discover that their lives have diverged to the point where the bonds that remain between them have become too thin, too attenuated, to sustain their friendship further. That people's values, aims and lifestyles can change. After college, the majority in both films had gone on to exceptional careers. Kelly Reichardt's superb Old Joy is a film of rare beauty unburdened by typical male - bonding clichÃ©s, more the "" big chill out "" than The Big Chill."
6339,"There's a mood, an energy, a style that Cassavettes was able to capture and portray that made this film so far removed from any clichÃ©d studio product geared toward teenyboppers. Forget what you know, forget N'SYNC, this guy is a real actor. He has all the right ingredients for a stellar acting career; charisma, screen presence, that separates him from the pretty faced phonies clogging the movie screens. But besides them you also have Ben Foster, who some might know form his TV Work, others from his great job in the movie Hostage, but most will recognise as that Angel in X-Men 3! He is the young man trying to grow up, and finds a real sense of comfort in his captors, as weird as it sounds."
6141,"The Usual Suspects was effective in misleading the audience because the plot is free of holes, and there is one well thought out twist that is believable and makes for a great ending. Director Paul McGuigan emulates Guy Ritchie's stylish visuals to some success, and guides the film about as well as the material allows. Slevin, The Rabbi, The Boss and Goodkat all stand out, and Hartnett, Kingsley, Freeman and Willis all turn in commendable and charismatic performances. Lucky Number Slevin is an impressive action crime thriller with some flaws but the good outweighs the bad in this one. Director Paul McGuigan is admirable in making this movie about a guy named Slevin who after a case of mistake identity finds himself caught in the middle of a war between two rival crime bosses known as The Rabbi and The Boss."
6350,"Despite Grant's admirable attempt to spin the romantic comedy's meet - cute moment, it's hard to believe Gray would fall for a chap who, for the lack of a better phrase, finds carnal comfort at the most unlikely occasions. As far as the chemistry between Garner and Olyphant, a love story about a plastic bag that falls in love with a piece of cardboard would be far more exciting and frankly far more realistic. It's polished, looks good; a cut above, say, the odd independent romcoms that tackle the trials and tribulations, the angst and adoration among a group of good friends. She has a smile that melts the hardest heart and although "" Catch and Release "" can never shake its conventions, whenever the film entertains, it's mostly because of Garner. Timothy Olyphant is beautiful to watch and Ms. Grant has used his beauty (and his fantastically revealing facial expressions) to the film's advantage."
6341,"Particularly' Rolf LassgÃ¥rd' (qv) does a fabulous job. Mads Mikklesen received the festival's Best Actor award for his role as Jacob, a man who runs an orphanage in India. Mads Mikkelsen (Jacob) puts up a terrific performance with acting that is as credible as it is subtle. It's certainly one of the best movies of 2006, and deserves wider distribution so that more people can see it. While most women are going to be thrilled by the beginning sequences and scenes (flashes of sensual dreams and a barechested Mads wandering the night, worrying), by the end they will be entirely caught up in other characters altogether."
6472,"You will go through a whole range of emotions as you watch this film, laughter, shock, sadness. In years in which seems that vulgarity is the better way to make laugh, this is a masterpiece. No prizes for guessing how it all works out, but it's nicely played, with Auteuil's grimly smiling desperation offset nicely by Boon's sheer sad sack likability. It's a redemption comedy, with Daniel Auteuil's antique dealer so disinterested in the people around him that he doesn't even know that his business partner is a lesbian and is amazed to find that he has no friends, merely contacts. Challenged to present his mythical best friend by the end of the month or lose a valuable vase, he sets about an increasingly desperate search that takes in strangers in the street and even a former classmate to all - too predictable results before hiring Danny Boon's personable cabdriver to show him how to make friends, oblivious to the fact that Boon doesn't seem to have any friends either."
6139,"But the really significant aspect of this movie is the realistic portrayal of the lives of the high school students. The characters are well fleshed out (which is amazing for most recent movies) and Antonio Banderas gets to be his uber - suave, ultra-rich self. Bandaras does a good job in this role. There are plenty of funny parts, as well as enough drama and interesting character conflicts to keep everything interesting. While Dianne Houston's screenplay is riddled with clichÃ©s and formulaic storytelling, novice filmmaker Liz Friedlander, who cut her teeth on music videos, inhabits the film with a lot of style, panache and energy thanks largely to her unknown ensemble of willing young talent and stand - up and cheer moments including a mÃ©nage a trios tango that sizzles."
6344,"You make them with good scripts and talented actors etc. . Kenny is the funniest, sweetest and most clever Aussie comedy since Priscilla Queen of the Desert and Muriel's Wedding. His adventures as chronicled in the film make for interesting viewing, and for a comedy, it has some quite moving and sentimental scenes that help to broaden the potential audience of this gem of a film. The humour was so good - natured, intelligent, authentic, full of irony and contained different layers of reality. The depictions of family life were terrific â€“ the ex-wife, the miserable father, the intolerant brother (played by the real - life brother and director of the film)."
6466,"Everyone from Asia to the Natives of North America have tales of shape - shifting humans, and for some reason wolves became the go to animal for it. There is absolutely nothing original in this story, but both the male and female actors are gorgeous and the fight scenes are good, especially an early gunbattle involving a tough revolver wielding grandmother. One consists of werewolves happy to feed on humans, while the other camp believes they're cursed and are trying to find a way to become fully human again. Fortunately for the lad, a small group of good werewolves, who wish to become human again, risk their lives to protect him. Skinwalkers will smooth the itch of werewolf fans."
6137,"Forget them; Das Leben der Anderen is an outstanding movie that should be seen everywhere. The former East Germany, a relatively small country of 16 million people, was controlled by the most sophisticated, cunning, and thorough secret police the world has ever seen, the East German Ministerium fÃ¼r Staatsicherheit, or "" Stasi . "" Das Leben der Anderen, ("" The Life of Others "") German director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's debut, builds this painful legacy into a fascinating, moving film. Played by the square - jawed Sebastian Koch, Dreyman is an (apparently) convinced socialist who's made his peace with the regime. These unfortunates must contend with every humiliation a totalitarian state can invent: their apartments are bugged, friends and family are recruited to inform on them, and chances to publish or perform can be extinguished by one stray comment from a Central Committee member."
6347,"This documentary encourages people to change their lives in a positive way. (Â±) Several times the interviewees give certain numbers and facts as proof of a statement they're making, but the methods of researching those facts aren't being explained. If a family member or a good friend of yours dies, then why should you force yourself into a constant state of joy? People are responsible for whatever problems they suffer. When pushed for an answer on how even a child could attract or manifest these horrors to their lives, they'll blame it on karma - perhaps the child abused, raped or otherwise brought this to themselves in a "" past life "" Oh, please."
6351,"Though the final plot twist is prepared for and makes as much sense as anything else in the film, still it feels flat and unsatisfying. This movie should get high marks for its style, but everything about its style that is likable, was ripped off from Guy Ritchie. The writer has clearly watched a few gangster movies and a couple of sopranos (best series ever) and thinks he can write a mafia movie! The violent scenes are pretty much the best part of the film, and some of them are genuinely tense. They offer fast paced entertainment, great character actors, twisty plot lines, explosions and more spent ordinance than used in a typical week in Baghdad."
6134,"What made early Wes Craven movies so special were these eary and daunting atmospheres he was so good in creating; And this is what Hills Have Eyes 2006 totally lacked. The question most people ask when it comes to modern day remakes is "" why remake a classic? "" The rest of the cast have some impressive film and TV credits between them, but nobody is a particularly' big' actor, which actually does this sort of film credit. The real stars of the show are the make - up department, who do a great job with the mutant cannibals. On its own merits, however, The Hills Have Eyes 2006 is a good film, and Aja can certainly be proud of himself for doing Craven's original justice."
6132,This film is probably not a classic or will be fondly remembered in five years but for the audience it is aimed at it succeeds on many levels. As the three gals hang around each other Aquamarine explains that she must show her father that love exists all around.
6130,"With Inside Man, Lee showcases an interesting way of directing thrillers. the way the robbery was conducted gave the viewer chills because it was so amazing. The character interaction between him and his sidekick (Chiwetel Ejiofor of "" Serenity "" fame) and the frustrated captain played by Willem Defoe is great with some sparkling dialog. Because while Inside Man does hit all the right notes when it comes to keeping you guessing about what is really going on, it is also very successful in mixing the grittier moments with comedy elements. While her part is potentially fascinating, she does not really get the chance to do anything with it other than look cool and act tough."
6129,"The film focuses on Jack DiNorscio, one of the accused mobsters (played by Vin Diesel), who decides to defend himself. Even though he spent half his life in jail he doesn't know much about legal proceedings and mostly speaks what comes into his mind thus sometimes making fun of the whole trial. During the Berlinale press conference Sidney Lumet said about Vin Diesel: "" People make the great mistake with action heroes. He has to talk a lot during the film which comes across very believable and authentic, and he shows a wide range of emotions from happiness to anger to mourning to being embarrassed to whatever. The overall acting is really good, Linus Roache shines in his role as prosecutor Kierney."
6356,"What's surprising is how funny much of it is, from Kristoffer's obsession with getting to the' truth' of his character (complete with dramatic pauses and would - be burning looks that just confuse people) to the obnoxious saga - obsessed Icelandic tycoon who wants to settle 400 years of national humiliation by humiliating the Danish company. Even as a comedy, the film works on several levels. The Icelanders doing the buying insist on dealing with the actual boss. Ali G. and Borat could learn a few things from these Danes (and one very irate Icelander). Highly recommended, on several different levels."
6357,"But when you add great editing, fantastic 80's soundtrack and footage you get story, that puts lot of movies like Scarface to shame. Life was good in Miami in the 70s. You could blow into town with $500 dollars in your pocket, and the next things you know, you are burying millions in your bag yard, driving the hottest cars, have two or three cigarette boats, a string of race horse, and land all the way up to horse country in Marion County. Saying that it is the true story behind Scarface and Miami Vice, Cocaine Cowboys barely touches on these comparisons, and seems to bring the most interest from these brief allegories. This was what happened to Miami with cocaine in the late 1970s and early 1980s, a story told exhilaratingly in Billy Corbern's fast - moving documentary' Cocaine Cowboys'."
6124,"The central theme of friendship in spite of differences and the humor found in trying situations plays well. A strong production for Twentieth Century Fox. This time, ice is melting and a great flood is threatening to drown all animals in the valley in three days, much to the delight of vultures who are keen on having a buffet with the bodies of those who will be unfortunate enough not to outlive it. It still has enough wit and laughs to support it most of the time but it's really much more of a standard film than the first one, and the animation genre in general doesn't reach new levels with this. Still, it's one of the better sequels there is, and it's a cool way to start the summer (in this side of the world, that is)."
6359,"Like Spielberg, Capra and many others the Polish brothers have arrived with a classic piece of storytelling. The knit - pickers can make a nice lint blindfold if they choose not to see this movie for what it is: entertainment. There is not a false note in it in fact, the music is perfect, the cinematography is first - rate, the casting is superb (watch for Bruce Dern looking very similar to Doc Brown in the Back to the Future movies). The movie shows how a family can come together to accomplish a task and achieve a dream even when the full weight of the Gov. comes against them. At the Q&A after the film it was revealed that Bruce took the role as a favor to the Polish brothers and that he essentially worked for free."
6360,"Body swap movies are nothing new and here the premise is the same; what raises it above are the two central perfromances which are strong and the overall sense of fun mixed with some good tackling of stereotypes. The next door neighbors Nell Bedworth (Samaire Armstrong) and Woody Deane (Kevin Zegers) have opposite behaviors and hate each other: the virgin geek Nell is polite, sensitive and well - prepared to go to Yale, while Woody is rude and his greatest expectation is to join a mediocre university due to his abilities playing football. Samaire Armstrong is especially good as "" Woody, "" walking and moving and acting "" like a guy "" and Kevin Zegers is good also but his characterization is more understated. Armstrong and Zegers have a cute chemistry and their individual performances were delightful. Armstrong and Zegers, as well as all the supporting actors and actresses, look like they have a fun time giving pleasant and congenial performances."
6123,"If you don't expect deep meaningful, life altering messages or commentaries on the deep ills of society you will enjoy the movie. Matthew's' live at home bud' s' featuring Justin Bartha as "" Ace "" is the perfect "" nerd "" and Zooey Deschanel as "" Kit "" has a dry sense of humor often steals the scenes she shares with Sarah Jessica. Matthew McConaughey is admittedly good looking to watch, but his abs and cast have been his supporting cast long enough. The performances by the supporting cast were delightful and the best of the movie - especially Kathy Bates and Zooey Deschanel. The rest of the cast, especially the character of Kit, are perfect for the parts played and extremely funny."
6122,"Though the story may seem like dÃ©jÃ  vu, the action is fast paced making this an exciting film to watch. He rattles on and on about anything that comes to mind, some of it funny, some of it trite. A standout performance is delivered by David Morse as the leader of the dirty cops, Frank Nugent. If you like his other successful concoctions such as the "" Lethal Weapon "" flicks, "" Superman, "" "" Conspiracy Theory, "" and "" The Omen, "" then you will certainly enjoy "" 16 Blocks . "" Eddie Bunker (Mos Def) made a deal with the D. A. office and will identify and testify against a dirty detective."
6121,"The storyline for the new' Pulse' is something a child could have come up with and is highly reminiscent of a movie released a few years back -' Dot com'. If you want to see one of the best horror movies in the past couple years, go see that one instead and forget about Pulse. It's one of those horror movies with eerie sets and shots."
6120,"As about two other people have said, this was a cute, fun, escape - reality - for -90-minutes-to-an-hour kind of a movie with no pretenses to be anything other that what it was. The more important part is what happens to the two fortunate / unfortunate souls sucked in by this crazy bit of magic."
6119,"The movie takes place in the future so they add in all kinda of high - tech gadgets that are so stupidly unrealistic it makes you laugh. at least Milla looks good in her outfits, and the outfits are cool. They bark with cute little "" yip yips! "" If you appreciate Milla Jovovich's body, it might be possible to enjoy this film by renting the DVD and watching it with the sound off and your techno MP3 collection blaring in the background while you do something productive, like picking the gunk out from beneath your toenails."
6367,"Lazarus and Rae (Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci respectively) have a great chemistry and a great respect for each other. The music was very bit as good as you would expect, especially when Mr. Samuel L. Jackson sings the blues. The character and set designs were just right, the casting of the supporting characters (even Justin Timberlake and especially Kim Richards) was spot on. Brewer seems to be a master at getting his characters to have the right mix of both compassion and malice as they set forward on their paths toward redemption. Like he did with Hustle and Flow, Brewer lays the music over the widescreen shots perfectly with simply titled fonts coming up statically."
6368,"Everyone who was walking out of the movie was saying how much they loved it from age 13 to an elderly couple and all ages in between. Two smart people zipping off to Vegas to get married after 6 days and having someone 30 years old first entertain thoughts of gaydom are just two large examples of stretches that ask the viewer for a bit too much latitude. Still, there are some funny moments, funny lines and a thought provoking identity theme that make it worthwhile. Sam and Charlie's whirlwind romance gets them hitched, but matters get complicated when Gray and Charlie share a passionate kiss. Heather's great as a supporting actress, but in "" Gray Matters, "" she proves that she can carry a film."
6127,"The actors' comedic senses of timing were impeccable. The greatest highlight of the movie of course is the star character Amanda Bynes, who is absolutely gorgeous and hilarious. This film is full of charming situations and healthy young people easy on the eyes, whether they are wearing clothes or not. And, so the classic tales of cross-dressing and other mischief found in such lighthearted comedies such as Twelfth Night and A Midsummer Night's Eve and As You Like It are used to good effect in this film. All the young actors and actresses do a good job of advancing the plot with their blocking and dialog and costumes."
6373,"This film does neither; the case of Karla Homolka and her accomplice, Paul Bernardo, is a fascinating series of events that exposed the incompetence of the provincial police and justice system. Laura Prepon is believable and cold as Karla Homolka, who was jailed for killing her sister and conspiring with sexual sadist and psychopath Paul Bernardo. While the murders themselves, which the film wallows in as its main focal point, were indeed sad and terrible, there was a horrid hilarity to the killers and the 80s retro, idealized image they presented to the world. Around 50% of the votes cast so far are 1 and this is understandable, as the subject matter in the movie is probably the darkest and most disturbing that any movie could possibly be - and to make matters worse, its all true. Disorder is accurately diagnosed by her psychiatrist, well - portrayed by veteran actor Patrick Bauchau."
6118,"Go see this if you like action movies with an interesting plot. The supporting cast was excellent, development of the characters rolled out in a believable manner with out a bunch of unnecessary revelations. Walker is surprisingly impressive considering the strictly one - dimensional roles he played in movies such as The Fast And The Furious and Into The Blue. This movie provides a nice twist on modern day mob movies. Drug addicts, hookers, mobsters, wife beaters, pedophiles, crooked cops and pimps cross the path of Oleg and Joey as they run through the city looking to stay alive."
6378,"Robin Wright Penn's Liv is truly Bergmanesque and provides the perfect icy foil for Jude Law's longing. His versatile and grown - up performance glues the ensemble and the story strands together. The support is top notch: Juliette Binoche is the pick of the rest, thrown into chaos by her thieving son and Law's flaky contemporary liberal; around her are a convincing neurotic (Penn), compassionate urban realists (Farmiga and Winstone) and Martin Freeman playing an almost cameo - like doppelgÃ¤nger to Law. A super film that, from its performances to its look, dispenses with preconception to examine the way modern individuals deal with one another in isolation. In Anthony Minghella's "" Breaking and Entering "", multiple crimes are committed against numerous people, but not all of them are prosecutable in a court of law."
6379,"Though this is small compared to most major movies, it is a pretty good amount for a smaller movie like this. Ioan Gruffudd, the young Welchman best known for his excellent portrayal of C. S. Forester's seafaring hero, Horatio Hornblower, in eight made - for - A&E movies (1998 - 2003), brings great depth and passion to his portrayal of this complex hero of social justice. However, the performances are quite good, some bordering on excellence."
6117,"Random scenes pop up, trying to get a laugh by basically reenacting the scene, not exaggerating it or making fun of it. The rare laughs were part genuine enjoyment and part trying to make the best of a horrible situation. If they don't knock your teeth out for setting them up to lose money and 90 minutes of their life, then you can go see it yourself. Everything you've read is true. The concept was great, and "" date movies "" are ripe for being made fun of."
6116,"Firstly, right away you get glimpes of STUNNING scenery that continue throughout the whole film. Although the human performances (Paul Walker, Bruce Greenwood and the necessary romantic lead, Moon Bloodgood) were mediocre at best, the canine actors really do steal your heart. Beautiful artic landscapes frame the main story line and on the big screen, it really takes your breath away. The dogs are very entertaining and their scenes with the science team are warm and amusing, even thrilling. The movie can be seen and enjoyed by all ages."
6382,"What is more important, to portray a fictional setting for the sake of giving people a mind blowing visual experience or to amuse and amaze them with clever plot twists and intelligent dialogs? During the big fights you'll also instantly notice the unique editing. There are a lot of "" time slowdowns "" throughout the battles which show what exactly is happening. The dialogs are simple and most often talk about moral values like freedom and honor. They either love it with passion calling it an epic movie of the 21th century, or hate it even more and throw it off like a piece of garbage consisting of mindless action and silly clichÃ© phrases."
6115,"Just close your eyes and go back in time. Young's singing Tyson's song symbolized the real heart of gold he so obviously has calling someone else's work the best. His voice seems to have lost none of its resonance and feeling since his searching for a heart of gold song made him almost iconic; his stories, such as one about his guitar coming from Hank Williams and then set to song in The Old Guitar, make the only bridges necessary among songs in a concert of songs. Demme, who has successes with Stop Making Sense and Storefront Hitchcock, concentrates most of his shots on close - ups of Young, whose low - key style demands the audience get as close as possible. Still, hearing the well - known older songs (Old Man, Heart of Gold) was like encountering an old friend unexpectedly."
6384,"Directed by Pierre Salvadori, Pricess is one heck of a delightful gem. It is playful, cheeky, and boasts excellent chemistry between its leads, which is crucial to pull off a romantic comedy so dependent on their banter and interaction. Audrey Tautou plays Irene, a high maintenance gold digging prostitute who flits from one elderly man to another, in the hopes of seducing and convincing them into marriage, while in the meantime milking all she could from their company. In an uncontrollable one night stand, she hooks up with waiter Jean (Gad Elmaleh), who while is totally out of her league, falls hard for her, and becomes a constant thorn in her side as she goes about her mission in life. And this is especially so with Jean's natural charms mixed with Mr Bean like demeanor."
6385,"There are also moments like the opening one at the park, where the unexpected happens and you really do get a surprise at the direction the story has just taken. There are other similar incredibly strong moments that will hit you with a shock, and they seem out of place and going against what you believe should be happening. The leads are good, particularly the young girl, Park Hyun - seo played by Ah - sung Ko, who is very convincing and strong in character. At times the emotions she shows are so natural and believable, you'll find yourself caught up in her scenes. The other characters continually walk that fine line between comedic and serious performances."
6113,"The first 20 minutes of the original film were pretty good but it was all downhill from there. The best way to describe it is to compare it to Hitchcock movies. Get a first - time screenwriter, an inexperienced director, a few TV actors looking for their bigscreen break and see what they can do. Simon West brings the same attractive banality to proceedings that he managed with Lara Croft, but his style of directing is decidedly generic, possessing no indicators of real talent or vision. The performances are routine, dark hallways replace genuine horror, and the scares are of the tired cat - in - the - closet variety."
6111,"Eventually Cox and his team baby - sit the hostages and circumvent there own success. There is an element that seems realistic and that is the acceptable number of henchmen who are employed by the leader. For example, the family dog Rusty, plays a prominent role when the bumbling fools take him hostage. Performances in the film are convincing. Despite this, director Richard Loncraine has crafted a film that is best described as what a computer would spit out if the command was: thriller."
6388,"Albeit, Jhumpa Lahiri, who won the Pulitzer Prize in 2000 for her book, Interpreter of Maladies, layers an otherwise plain story with human emotions and displays of courage and trials that are so honest, one can relate to them effortlessly and draw parallels with one's own experiences. Perhaps its most understated point is that none of the good would have come to pass but for the success of the arranged marriage between Ashoke and Ashima, i. e., that this wonderful young woman had the good fortune to link up with the kind and loving Ashoke. Tabu carried more of the weight here and was just gorgeous as a young bride and grew into a mother with many cares but who held herself with dignity throughout. It is the success of the parents' marriage that makes everything possible. Both bring a level of assurance and compassion that ground the film completely, especially Tabu who makes the seemingly modest character arc of Ashima really striking."
6110,"A children's animated movie the is completely and totally suitable for children of all ages. The most hard core Curious George fans can rent the DVD. For those interested in such curious things: this movie is animated, hand - drawn in vibrant primary colors with fun background music by Jack Johnson. If you have any youth in your heart, you will be delightfully swept away by the good ship H. A. Rey into the antic - filled, lovely and gentle world of Curious George and his new family. So did the preview theater, full not only with kids of all ages with their parents & grandparents, but a couple in their 20's on a date!"
6108,"It also incorporates a very fun sequence with 006, creates gags out of Viagra, ring tones, the TSA, etc. . The movie may or may not appeal to fans of the original movies, but fans of Martin, especially the young ones acquainted with him (as well as director Shaun Levy) from the "" Cheaper by the Dozen "" movies, will love it. If you remember, the original Pink Panther was made in' 63, A Shot in the Dark was in' 64, and it was 12 years before the next one with Sellers was made. While, sadly, the movie never once reaches the level of hilarity the originals did, the laughs are steady, the story flows nicely, and the characters are extremely likable. There were plenty of laughs and a simple but serviceable plot that held together for the whole film."
6104,"The actors all do fine jobs, and the special effects are pretty much top - notch (when they're not CGI) and the pace just moves along nicely. Directed by james wong with style and a pace that hits the ground running, the film is very much like a roller coaster in its self - fast, packed full of laughs and most importantly full of frights. What's more, the flick abounds with awesome deaths and these quality gore scenes are probably the biggest virtues of this horror movie. Excellent scenes, excellent storyline, and new and unusual ways to die makes this an excellent addition to the first two."
6100,"Beyond that, this seems to be a collection of gee, let's find some pretty looking people and put them in tight uniforms. Tyrese Gibson can be a good actor when he wants to be, like in Four Brothers. What they got right: The uniforms, by and large. The lacteal fluid extracted from the female of the bovine species is prolific to the Nth degree.)"
6088,"The action scenes were bigger, with great direction and camera - work. It was refreshing to see that the werewolves were still practical make - up creations rather than CG. There was also the added bonus of sex scenes. one where a guy is having fun with a couple chick vampires, and one between the two leads. ladies will enjoy much shirtless Speedman action."
6086,"Its a nice, light movie to start out the New Year and clear away those post-holiday blues! It was fun and sometimes that's what going to the movies should be about; especially given all the heavy hitters nominated for Golden Globes this year. Despite the film's good nature and warm feelings, it was still too cheesy at times. Within the first 15 minutes, you see her cook a wonderful looking meal which she cooked along with the show "" Emeril "", in which she takes a picture of and gives to her neighbor."
6085,"Glory Road is an inspirational movie but not a very accurate movie if you know the history of TWC. Filmed with a gritty, sepia look, the viewer gets the sense that he's watching genuine footage from the '60s. Right from the trailers and the posters, you probably know how "" Glory Road "" is gonna go: an underdog NCAA basketball team must face great odds to win the championship. Coming from the school of thought that "" showboatin's nothing but insecurity, "" Haskins was intent on teaching a group of street - ballers the fine art of fundamentals because he knew that's what it would take to win a championship. Production design is just as authentic, using replicas of signs and banners that were at the actual game."
6084,"The film has a dark undertone to it and every character is torn between hard choices of power, loyalty, friendship and in Tristan's case, love. The battle scenes are very well done. Everyone is in immediate danger of mutilation and death, making the fight scenes more intense. The absence of any Hollywood superstars makes the film all that much better. As of this writing, it is still in theaters and is worthy of the admission price, not to mention a worthwhile future rental."
6083,"If you liked There's Something About Mary and previous Sandler films, with the exceptions of Spanglish and Punch Drunk Love, you will enjoy Grandma's Boy. This is one of those C - list acting B movie comedies that should be awful but it's really pretty funny. There are laughs throughout the entire film. But this is a fun movie that will probably go by the waste side due to lack of stars, so catch it on DVD. For those who enjoy movies like: Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, Super Troopers, and Harold and Kumar; you would totally love this movie and find yourself peeing your pants."
6101,"Most jokes fall flat and the film is predictable, but the movie still has it's laughs and it's enjoyable somehow. The crime scenario is beyond stupid and leads to a whole host of idiotic slapstick scenes involving Big Momma taking on the gun - wielding bad guys, but if you have a high level of tolerance for this sort of thing, "" Big Momma's House 2 "" should provide you with a good share of laughs amid all the clunkers. However, the comedy was actually quite dull, pedestrian, uninvolved, and unintellectual, which means it earns six stars out of ten. But what really surprises is how relatively few stupid moments come throughout the movie. But Big Momma still does some funny ragging on white culture, as well as just yuppie culture of all colors."
5752,"But as the tagline of this film makes clear, for these characters everything is most definitely NOT going to be OK. This film does an amazing job of capturing the feel and tone of the book as well as the paranoia, perceptual distortions, and chaos of hallucinogenic overindulgence. Still, most adaptations of PK Dick stories take a few basic ideas and try to shape them into more conventional films that fit into established genres. After awhile, you begin to get used to the rotoscoping and then suddenly, there will be something thrown in that will call attention to itself and remind you that you are watching animation. Great performances all around and kudos to Linklater for his fantastic vision."
8540,There truly is potential here for a great story--kind of a gay romance version of the Odd Couple. There are a couple of laugh - out - loud funny lines - mostly delivered by actor Artie O'Daly as Eli. The two leads acting is competent (when they fall flat it's mainly due to the terrible writing) and their characters have some interesting aspects.
6671,"The scenes when they are hanging out with their friends contain witty, realistic dialogue and interactions. At times incisively funny, at other times angst ridden and sad, the film takes the viewer through the gamut of emotions experienced by the characters. Keep your eye on Joachim Trier - he's going places. The dialogue is overlapping the images, sporadically rejoining with the mouth movements of the characters before getting unsynched again. The opening introduction ends on a happy note, so there is always hope the meat of the film will too, despite the allusions to epic tragedy of Icarus flying too close to the sun."
6677,"Shot entirely in black and white, there are several moments of stunning beauty, contrasting with the frequently dull and suburban backgrounds in which such a passionate battle is being waged by both sides. It was an outstanding documentary that gave both sides of the issue, even to the point of showing an actual abortion being performed. Kaye's scope is large and all encompassing, with interviews from the likes of pragmatic minded Noam Chomsky and Alan Dershwitz (the latter's parable about the Rabbi hits it the nail on the head, if there could be a nail in this), to intelligent pro-lifer Nat Hentoff, to Roe (real name Norma McCorvey) who got converted to being pro-life after setting the stage for all of this in the 70s, to the clean - cut psycho Paul Hill. On a purely visual level; the shots were flawless, the color choice (or lack of a use of color) was enthralling, and the editing flowed seamlessly back and forth between two sides of an issue that heeds extreme opinions on both ends."
6407,"If you are looking for a good lesbian themed comedy, watch "" Gray Matters . "" In addition to their differences in sexual orientation, there are other love entanglements that get in their way - "" with all the twists and turns of a classic Puccini "" as the DVD case says. Better than Woody Allen's last five movies combined, PUCCINI FOR BEGINNERS is that snappiest, funniest, romantic comedy in recent memory. Despite that, there are some mildly funny parts and the cast is attractive, especially Gretchen Moll. "" Puccini for Beginners "" is one of those small - scale independent features that thinks it's being smarter and more insightful about romantic relationships than it really is."
6664,"A story told in such a way as to become a part of your awareness, a gentle reminder of the fantastic, mythical and magical components of what is best in humanity whilst not forgetting what it means to be human. The colors, the framing, costumes, lighting, and the backdrops are gorgeous; like something out of a dream. He manages to capture a kaleidoscope of emotion as diverse and generous as the tones and colors that deliver this movable feast for the eyes. Director Tarsem Singh, as expected, delivers every scene as a work of beauty, and peppers the film throughout with visual surprises. The Fall is simply Tarsem Singh's love letter to cinema."
6698,"This movie is a feel good movie about being gay, being in touch with yourself (at some level) and relationships. Inter-generational gay relationships are the missing link of contemporary gay cinema, and the way in which their friendship develops is handled with great poignancy and charm, helped by an impressive performance from the great Patrick Bauchau. Completing the triptych is Joey (aka Blowy Joey), a cute - as - a-button twink who plays' son' to the dysfunctional duo. The missing element is love, and in several ways he comes into proximity with that missing thread: his newest client is Gregory (Patrick Bauchau in a richly nuanced performance as a elderly closeted loner) who introduces X to the finer things in life, including introspection and looking for what is missing in his world. It is well written, well directed, well acted and has messages that cover a fairly broad territory (racism, homophobia, hustler life style, relationships, coming out tales and tales from the closet, etc)."
6410,"Kudos to the DoP, the cinematography in this film is fantastic and solid throughout. David Schwimmer and Simon Pegg as the two moronic losers are spot on. Schwimmer does show some mannerisms of Ross Gellar from' Friends' but still does a great job. Pegg and Schwimmer have worked again in' Run Fatboy Run', a hilarious comedy only here they work as director and actor instead of co-actors. ' Big Nothing' deals with strong themes such as' crime does not pay' or' money not being the solution to happiness' and ends in a wonderfully ironic way as: Josie the Wyoming Widow (a murderess) comes across the Oregon Undertaker, (former) conman Gus is conned in the end, and Charlie finally receives an offer to have his book published but he already chose an alternative route which leads to a different destiny."
6411,"Hong Sang - soo's latest, Woman on the Beach, is a comedy drama about love and the complications that develop in relationships when one partner is less than candid with the other. Like the films of Eric Rohmer, Woman on the Beach is simple on the surface yet explores a deeper layer of complexity in human relationships that is insightful and revealing. As the film opens, director Joong - rae (Kim Seung - woo) travels to Shinduri Beach on Korea's West Coast hoping to renew his inspiration. On the surface, she is a strong, independent woman, while Joon - rae gives the appearance of a calm and confident artist, yet both are rebounding from previous relationships and are very vulnerable. When the morning comes, Joong - rae's warm emotions of the previous night have turned chilly."
6702,"The film takes its viewers on an in depth journey of the subject through seven European countries, most notably France, Italy, Poland and Germany. Hitler also created a "" hit - list "" of famous works he wanted for his collection, most of which directly correspond to his invasion of various European countries. Art collecting was a highly important pastime among Nazi officials for a variety of reasons, as discussed largely with Herman Goering and Hitler himself who had amassed enormous, unparalleled personal collections, largely through theft. As a Nazi invasion loomed, hundreds of people, in France's world famous Louvre for example, gathered and worked tirelessly, packing the priceless art and transferring it to castles throughout the French countryside. The film examines the seventy - year plus struggle to restore and reclaim these stolen masterpieces, many of which remain unaccounted for."
6794,"Nevertheless, beside it's religious significance, "" Ostrov "" has a brilliant image directing, with superb shots of the remote locations, and a very good and balanced script - even a surprising final turnaround, for those who may have felt the need for it. Everything is great about this movie. The film's actors deliver top notch performances, the cinematography is excellent, and the sound design is thought through. Anatoli, was inspired from the lives of some Russian "" fools for Christ "" - men who tried to hide their sanctity and keep their humbleness behind a mask of apparent insanity - especially from the life of St. Theophile the Fool for Christ. And so today they did (the movie is still in the theaters and is doing really good at the box office)."
6813,"If you are at all interested in Freudian, Laconian, or Kristevian discourse, this movie is a must. It connects these theories with popular film, making them much more palpable and enjoyable than simply reading or thinking about them. Bear in mind, any film (let alone documentary) which asserts any kind of truth, will generate an adverse and proportional amount of cynicism, from those to whom any suggestion of and or search for truths is already meaningless, those of you who are already Masters of psychology, film, and captains of the soul, will no doubt find this movie redundant, after all, you already know everything there is to know. mostly brilliant, and worth watching for those interested in movies, psychology, and modern philosophy. A little like Scott Mclouds' "" Understanding Comics "", director Sophie Fiennes, inter-grates Slovene philosopher, psychologist, and social critic Slavoj Zizek right into many of the films and specif scenes he discusses."
6815,"A masterpiece, story -, acting -, picture - and sound-wise. Vogel as Hans is hilariously funny, BrÃ¼hl outstanding as his real counterpart and a compelling Simone Timoteo. either life is nothing or it must be everything Sebastion Schipper introduces his characters with humour and compassion and reflects on the complexity and contradictions of human nature. BrÃ¼hl is as versatile as a haystack."
6825,"Spectators can be fickle at 9: 45 a. m., and it is a testament to the director's talent that his film elicited a laugh - out - loud response from beginning to end. The various fates that are in store for Edgar are, yes, unusual at times, but the comedy is particularly strong in this film because each trajectory is so "" unexpected . "" It is a film with great depth, but it needs to be emphasized that, first and foremost, OBER works as an accessible comedy that even the most skeptical movie - lovers will enjoy. Most films about human life's ordinary characters are able to charm audiences as they depict the true feelings of human beings. Dutch film' Ober' is one such film which succeeds enormously as it has chosen a very good theme."
6658,"Steve Buscemi's captivating performance, Michael Pitt's innocent yet noble attitude, Gina Gerswin, Allison and Callie's brilliant and lovable performances just drags you into the movie, where you feel a connection with most, if not all of the leads. It's all in good amusement to see the "" reality serial - killer "" show being directed for "" realism "", but it all doesn't lead up to anything significant to say past some shallow messages. Great directing from Tom DiCillo gives their relationship a real "" odd couple "" situation with great drama infused with some genuinely funny scenes. What you get with this movie is a very solid performance from Michael Pitt who plays Toby a homeless kid in his early 20s that through a chance encounter finds a friend in struggling paparazzi Len played by a on fire Steve Bescumi. This movie could have been a tragedy; but, it ended up being a sweet, incredible story about relationships and romance."
6421,"Satoshi Kon's "" Paprika "" is a great example of anime at its finest. Kon's new film is not the dark mind warps of Perfect Blue or Paranoia Agent, this is closer to blending of real and unreal of Millennium Actress and Tokyo Godfathers light and airy touches. Its not the best thing that director Satoshi Kon has done, but its a good time in the movies (which it celebrates). In some ways, the movie's storyline resembles a bit like the Matrix movies (which of course, borrows from Japanese anime), in having the hero the champion of both worlds - the real one, and inside the artificially created one. The Animation: Stunning; Madhouse always does good work and Kon's movies always produce some fun reality bending sequences."
6423,"The CG sequences are slicker and more impressive, and so is pretty much everything else, including the consistently confident directing. Part one succeeded in establishing a dark, aggrieving setting with more or less strong characters and ended with a bunch of prophecies that really pronounced some major threats to come in part two. The characters are reduced to bystanders (like Bear) in the best case and to total clowns in the worst (hey, what exactly does Anton do in the last hour of the movies? It is comparable by grandiosity to Titanic, and to StarWars by excitement, to The Matrix by plot. Action, drama, suspense, CGI that's definitely better, and more believable, than in any of the matrix movies, a very intricate plot, that you have to follow carefully throughout the movie, wonderful acting and great dialogs."
6424,"And coming from a director who used to be part of the real scene, it might be the most authentic picture about skinheads ever made. Enter the gang Woody, Milky, Pukey, et all, a rag tag bunch of mods and skinheads complete with crimped haired girlfriends, with the absence of his father and any real sense of being part of something Shaun is quickly welcomed into the group and takes up not just the mannerisms or clothes but drinking, smoking and growing up to quickly. Meadows' films defy categorisation and always exceed expectation, as anyone who has seen A ROOM FOR ROMEO BRASS or DEAD MAN'S SHOES will attest. The metaphor of the country getting behind Thatcher in the Falklands juxtaposed with that of the skinheads, including the initiated Shaun, getting behind the slightly off kilter Combo is handled with a great sense of poignancy and it is moving to see both stories unfold from within the film and library footage. They live in a happy community in the early 80s, having fun and being together in a totally grey unfriendly working class environment."
6425,"They have reached a stage of lifetime love based on deep knowledge of each other and acceptance of past misdemeanours. Secure in the knowledge that he has given his wife many years of happiness, Grant glosses over his unfaithfulness in their younger days. Julie Christie, for whom the lead role was written, exudes dynamic good looks and the vibrancy of a young woman, bathed in such warmth and passion of years. After chatting happily for five minutes, she said, quite chirpily and very politely, "" What's your name again? "" Julie Christie was luminescent, with those wonderful eyes of hers increasingly speaking her joy and pain as words and memory failed her."
6846,"Oh joy of joys, why aren't there more movies like this around. Troma fans delight, Lloyd has returned with a film definitely worth waiting all of these years for, and he pulls no punches and makes no appologies. The fact that movies like' Meet the Spartans' get theatrical releases and this doesn't further proves something needs to be done to get these far superior flicks out for everyone else to enjoy. Consistently funny the whole way through, with some excellent musical numbers and some truly disgusting special effects,' Poultrygeist' proves that morally incorrect satire is still alive and kicking. By offending absolutely everyone, POULTRYGEIST can offend no one."
6967,"The first segment has a good - looking ghetto - gal being granted super-powers by evil voodoo - man Danny Trejo to take on her whole graffiti - spraying neighborhood. And when you've attained wealth and stardom in a rather dubious manner, you're in for some real' shiiiit'. The scene (first segment) that proofs sipping on gin & juice can cause a nasty splitting head - ache is a total hoot! He's just rapping it up on some fiery ghetto - set with a lot of demon - babes shaking their T&A. The don't - take - it - all - serious vibe and Da Doggster's witty nonsense made it all a bit more enjoyable too."
7000,"It is one of the best GLBT Asian films to come out in the past 5 years. One can only hope that TLA Video's upcoming Region 2 release (available through Amazon. NO REGRET (HUHWIHAJI ANHA) is an impressive film from Korea, especially in that it is the first venture for writer / director Hee - il Leesong who gives evidence of not only a his ability to create a film that examines life in Korea in a verismo style, but also knows how to cast and direct a crew of actors in a polished manner. If you want a film to entertain and flood your emotions, watch this film. The acting is wonderful (including the superbly talented Lee Young Hoon, who is simply heartbreaking), and Leesong Hee - il's script and direction are top - notch - all the more remarkable when one considers that this was the first feature - length film for both men."
7004,"Other good Gay teen movies are TCOC is basically a fine and fun movie. But funny accents and funny clothes do not a good film make. , but in the end of that movie he was allowed to show his more serious and endearing side which forecasted his acting in TCOC. While this is not explained anywhere in the film, there are a lot of clues."
6429,"The fact that Jones was a little ahead of the curve on the most sensitive and essential issue in American society, and since he was cursed by an unusual sense of self - belief, it led him to believe that he was special, and that his message and the principles by which he operated his church, were unique. After 9 years, in 1974 he moved the church again, this time to San Francisco, where he ingratiated himself with local politicos like George Moscone and Willie Brown, and, in return for his support of Moscone for Mayor, Jones was appointed to the city's housing commission. It does a good job of showing what attracted people to the Peoples Temple and how, gradually, things started to go very wrong. There is footage from the days of the Peoples Temple as well as new and moving testimony (that feels like the right word) from former members and family of members. The strength of this film lies in the fact that it isn't just a play - by - play from afar, but a collection of first - hand interviews with people who were actually there, and who knew the key players."
7132,"Zach Galifianakis is probably one of the best comedians to come out of the scene in the last 10 years But unlike most stand - up releases, this feels very much like a guy working his material out, a dry run - through, if you will, not the kind of show you'd want to pay full - price to see. It all adds up to one of the most unique and satisfying stand - up performances you're likely to see out of all the current "" newbies "" out there. Part of his show was his "" twin brother "" Seth in a hilarious interview from NPR's Brian Unger (watch the DVD extras â€“ adds to the humor), but mostly it's Zach on stage in his dry, very dry sense of humor as he beats up the audience, who don't seem to mind that he's biting the hand that fed him. His one - liner zings of racism, idiocracies or just observations while looking (again) intoxicated or simply uninterested, make the whole act."
7218,"When the child actresses discussed their tutors' educational ritual (or lack thereof, with stories of tutors getting high when they were supposed to be teaching), their stories were a bit sad, but still intriguing. The stories these women told about their experiences were usually fascinating. They coped well with life after their silver platters went away, and it could have been the result of their good, attentive parents. This is nice little documentary and after the movie is over you have a good feeling not a sad one as many of these let's catch up to documentaries. These women, most of whom were no older than 38 when this documentary was released, seem to be all well adjusted after starring in one of the most popular Broadway shows of all time."
6625,"Penelope also has problems with the middle section, the opening is absolutely brilliant and the ending works in some odd way, but the middle, and second third, is just bland and feels like it is treading water. The film is a nice, family friendly flick, that while a bit cutesy at times has a genuine heart and some decent performances. It is a treat to see Reese Witherspoon portraying an edgier gal than norm and James McAvoy is a heartthrob! It might be one of Ricci's best performances, as good as Black Snake Moan, but completely different roles. However Ricci's performance is truly brilliant, she's so sweet and innocent, and the scenes where she speaks to McAvoy via a mirror is just pitch perfect."
7248,Where did he find the insights that made him such an inspiration to other artists? Making a famous rock - star biopic must be a temptation to fill it with crowd - pleasing footage of their songs. He has looked at how the formative years made the man. Twenty five hours of unreleased interviews provide a voice - over for the film. Zepplin used strident contrasting sections: gentle harmonies would alternate with heavy metal sections.
6146,"After a decade of anti-sex AIDS - induced hysteria, a film about a wildly - sexual hotbod who thrill - kills to heighten her sexual pleasure was pretty enticing stuff. The rest of the performances range from bad to terrible--and Michael Caton - Jones (a typically safe director--one who doesn't always do great work but manages to make worthwhile movies) has officially delivered his first true turkey; a movie so bad people were laughing at certain moments that were intended to be serious. What's important is the interactions between these and other characters in the story. The screenplay is full of intentionally funny dialogues."
7254,"For this is truly an original film that has indie written all over it, in both style and substance, and has elements of drama and comedy and wonder and twists and turns galore. Those three elements force a focus on these young folks' faces, and so much of this script is told through Haas and Jones' incredibly expressive eyes. The Virginia countryside that serves as the setting is breathtaking, while the gritty, unhurried blue collar town in which the protagonists live and work reflects the unhurried nature of the film itself. Lukas Haas made his screen debut some 20 years ago as the innocent Amish boy who witnesses a brutal murder in the Harrison Ford drama, "" WITNESS "" and since then has made an impressive indie film career playing all sorts of characters - good and evil - with his soulful, expressive eyes doing most of the acting. Carter's eccentricities come into full bloom at dusk - after shutting up the workshop, he habitually stalks a beautiful young violinist from UVA's music school back to her apartment, and observes the girl's practice sessions until she retires for the night."
6148,"As someone wisely says in this hilarious, poignant opus, ratings don't really matter. However, the MPAA ratings board still does exercise a certain de facto censorship power. Kirby Dick puts together a nice cross-section of directors and "" talking heads "" who discuss the MPAA ratings board's biases when it comes to realism, sex, violence, gay themes, and other taboo issues in films. Some examples are: Kubrick, Tarantino, Lynch, Woo, Friedkin, Peckinpah, Aronofsky, and countless others. Alright, let's just say it right from the start: the MPAA sucks."
6149,"James Gunn wrote Slither as an homage to the horror movies he loved. His love for his wife is one of his better sides) who is stung by an alien insect. It's obvious from the previews that this is a bit of a comedy. It keeps the audiences entertained like few other movies can. While it's easy to see the influences of every horror movie from Night of the Living Dead (1968) to Tremors (1989), Slither is itself a gutsy horror ride that firmly stands on its own."
6150,"Rob Schneider, David Spade, Nick Swardson and Jon Lovitz are all good in their parts whilst Jon Heder seems to be stuck in his Napolean Dynamite character. Jon Heder is "" almost "" Napolean Dynamite, similar voice, but the character is funnier. May be typecasting John Heder a bit too much but he's good at the part he plays."
6151,"It is a full 3d movie with a high contrasted black and white render. In this optic, it goes one step further than the excellent "" Sin City "" adaptation from R. Rodriguez. The direction stays sober and controlled despite the infinite possibilities of the medium, and that is a really good surprise. Even though the technical is excellent, it shows its limits in some romantic sequences (a bit like "" final fantasy "" did). They have used live action motion capture fitted into key - frame animation, with stark jet black and bright white contrasts and a heavily shadowed rotoscoped background."
6152,"The standout is Anniston, who normally doesn't register much in her "" star "" turns, but here, as she did in "" The Good Girl "", she shines because she manages to keep her character real and believable. Anniston does her best, which here works better than in any of her other roles. Franny (Joan Cusack) is very rich, just raises her kids with full time help, and is perfectly happy with her husband Matt (Greg Germann), her two children, and the world. A pivot point is the pet fiction in American social comedy that friends stay together even when their fortunes come to vary widely. The characters are 3D, their lives interesting, the dialog graceful and funny."
6154,"The key to enjoying a Scary Movie is to see it as a series of sketches based on popular movies, rather than a stand - alone film. Craig Bierko does a very good Tom Cruise impression, as well. If you liked the other movies, especially 3, this is a must see. With the help of newly befriended neighbor and failed father Tom Ryan, Cindy sets out to get some answers on a long hilarious journey. If you want a few good laughs then this is what you're looking for."
7435,"At first the relationship benefits both as Gregor's recipes influence Eden's home life and Eden's presence inspires Gregor's cooking. Charlotte Roche and Josef Ostendorf put in strong performances in the main roles. Ostendorf especially puts forth an emotional performance and as wonderful as Roche is, it is Ostendorf who carries the movie. , Hofmann's radical film about panic, this is an intense work about different shades of happiness and joy. The best in the film is the work of Josef Ostendorf and Charlotte Roche who are seen as Gregor and Eden, respectively."
6157,"After all these years, they've still got it - and Tomlin, an Altman favorite, is particularly up to par with the snap - and - go dialogue. The director's brilliance is that his lens cares about what technical and bits of business that come to affect in the making of the final show which really tell the story - of a group of people who spend their Saturday nights singing songs, telling stories and transmitting their folksy well - wishes to an imaginary audience listening in on their bedside table radio. Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin as the singing country Johnson sisters bring back memories of Reese Witherspoon's amazing turn as June Carter and Streep's own previous country singer in Postcards. The big stars attempting local (or Oshkosh, Wisconsin) accents were not at all convincing, at least to this native. Despite it's frigid demeanor, "" A Prairie Home Companion "" is filled with warm, quiet moments that offers each cast member has a shining, sterling moment of performance - though none takes centre stage and overpowers or overacts."
6158,"With Douglas on the run from the law, he becomes similar to Dr. Richard Kimble of The Fugitive, hunting the proverbial one - armed man while at the same time, relying on his smarts to outwit fellow agents, which turned out to be quite interesting to watch - despite slick processes, it still boils down to the performance and gullibility of individual agents. The beautiful couple had chemistry that could have resembled X-Files' Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, but alas these two had very little to do here. Nonetheless, it's still a pretty interesting look into the lives of probably the most highly charged and tense protection detail in the world, and the typical threats that they face daily, including the following up on every nutcase's threat on the life of the most powerful man in the world. It's a decent suspense and investigative thriller, with enough subplots to keep you entertained. Eva Longoria is very attractive though."
6159,"The atmosphere was perfect, the acting was on point, the creatures were amazing, well, everything was amazing. Sounds, music, colors and even meticulous set design that pays homage to the game series. Rhada is a amazing actress, she has a face which can tell a billion tales with just a slight twitch and she is very believable as a mother looking for her child. Konami as well as Sony loved it so much they didn't cut anything."
6436,"Overall The Librarian 2 has enough action, adventure and twists to keep you interested. It is popcorn fun for fans of those movies and Wylie does a great job. That's how persuasive the sets were! You can have a great plot and a great cast, but if your directing is bad, you've got no femur, and everything is just a little bit off. Well - thought out plot line with all the magic and silliness this kind of entertainment demands."
6178,"The rest of the cast is good and most of them were unknowns. Black is great and pulls off some excellent poses. Jared Hess shoots his movies like a funny David Fincher. His obsession with grime and dirt and everything looking old and decrepit, is almost fetishistic. There is dynamic lighting, proper shot composition, and interesting camera movements."
6163,"The movies are about a government sponsored high - tech commando team that uses force to achieve their goals, including Spiderman - like stunts, video - game - like chases, explosions, firefights and duke - outs with the bad guys, all of which would advertise their presence to the world and likely negate anything they accomplish while signing their own death warrants. The best scene must be where Ethan is handcuffed, and, IN 4 OR LESS SECONDS, head butts the bad guy, steals his pen, and uses it to open the handcuffs! "" Mission: Impossible III, "" the latest installment of the blockbuster movies which in turn were based from a TV series, is for those looking for a way to start off the summer season at the movies. In the action scenes, his facial expressions are concentrated and focused and utterly convincing. The action scenes are not only interesting; they're spectacular at times."
6164,"Bob hides the truth to his family, rents a recreational vehicle and tries to convince his dysfunctional family that a road trip to the Colorado Rocky Mountains would be good to bring old values back to their family. This family entertainment has good messages relative to family bonding, pressure in the job and true friends. The movies are chosen to be kid friendly. And the weird Gornicke were just adorable. Either see the movie now, or wait till it releases on DVD, but see it."
6165,"United 93 is a truly inspiring tale about the 4th hijacked plane that crashed in Pennsylvania. There were no Bruce Willis or Wesley Snipe types amongst the passengers; they were ordinary folk in extraordinary situations, responding the best way they could. Masterfully written and directed by Paul Greengrass, this relentlessly intense movie covers that fateful morning when United Airlines Flight 93 departed Newark for San Francisco with 33 passengers and seven crew members on board. The power of the film comes from its surprisingly apolitical perspective and the inclusion of the ground personnel trying to comprehend the scope of all the redirected planes that day, in particular, Ben Sliney who effectively plays himself that day, the just - promoted supervisor of the National Air Traffic Control Center in Herndon, Va. . The cast of passengers are a group of largely unknowns, which lends great respectability and reality."
6166,"Overall, "" Stick It "" is one of the funniest "" girly - teeny - booper "" movies out there. But, if you sit through it, you realize that it cooks up a lot of valid food - for - thought. While not a serious drama, this family movie brings with it a nice balance of family values, rebellious teen coming of age movie, and light humor that maintains an edge. This is good summer, female movie with sensitivity and improves on its predecessors like The Cutting Edge. This gymnastics movie has more interesting behind the scenes looks at this sport bringing both educational and entertainment value not typically experienced in sports movies."
7640,Second Concert DVD from the mad Irishman is very funny. Moran twists and savages everyone and everything with his unique view of things. He structures his delivery pretty well for the most part for example using the topic of people seeking a better life to mock rural and national stereotypes as the first of his flows. Some of his jumps later in the show are sudden and seem a bit random but mostly it works well. How he deals with the odd heckler is amusing and quite sensible even if the viewer always hope for a cutting putdown to any heckler.
6168,"It is a much stronger film than other Dreamworks titles like Madagascar and Shark Tale, and really seems like it can stand next to the likes of Shrek 1 and 2. While this movie doesn't have the depth of Finding Nemo or Shrek, it was a very fun and well done animation by Dreamworks. Add to that the typical messages about family, friends, and doing - right and you have the formula for a great family comedy. There are both heartwarming and chilling references to the importance of family, especially a family under external pressures from a society that they do not understand, a culture that considers them vermin. Plenty of clever asides will appeal to a wholesome sort of cultural nostalgia, without ever seeming derivative or repetitive."
6169,"Ethan Suplee provides the hyper - actively aggressive role he has become beloved for. Throw in Anjelica Huston and Steve Buscemi in delightfully understated roles, a string of murders courtesy of the mythical Strathmore Strangler, and the positively stunning Sophia Myles as the nude drawing class model Audrey who becomes both the object of Jerome's affection and the source of his disillusion, and you have got a dysfunctional masterpiece. The cast is terrific: John Malkovic, Anjelica Huston, Jim Broadbent, Sophie Myles, among others. The firsthalf of the film was amusing, but when it turned extremely dark in the final act, it just didn't feel right. And making fun of the people and faculty at such a place is where the comedy in Art School Confidential takes wing."
6179,"This is very simply a lovely film on every level, from dialog, to direction, to cinematography, to consistently outstanding acting performances across the board. Love is illogical in many ways but when you find that certain someone, it's magical. See this film with someone you love. See it with someone you desire. Note to Hollywood: You have in these leads potentially one of the great romantic pairings in the history of film."
6170,"On New Year's Eve, the luxury cruise ship Poseidon is hit by an enormous wave that flips it upside - down stranding thousands of passengers underwater. Out of the top 10 top grossing movies each year, how many actually make a profit?"
7256,"In all honesty this is the most alive film and most "" emotional "" film Greenaway has made in 20 years, since Drowning by numbers. The film is so easy to fall into, it unlike almost anything Greenaway has done before. Not as visually complex as' Prosperos' Books', not as intriguing as' Draughtsman's Contract', not as innovative as' The Suitcases',' Nightwatching' is however a little of everything and, of cause, more. Like all Greenway films, this one to be watched many times to discover new and new layers. The power of women over men is something that Greenaway has always reflected on in his films, and in that context Nightwatching represents a mellowing of his gaze."
6442,"If you believed everything that came out of the Hostel: Part 2 director's mouth, you'd be under the impression that this was a new lesson in extreme cinema, pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable on screen to new and previously unheard of levels. Young, nice and pretty girls with much to offer the world and whether or not dismembering them is more shocking than torturing and killing a horny male jock is a matter for feminist academics to debate. All talk of this being a doom - laden, intestine shredding nerve - jangler can do nothing to disguise the fact that it apes the masters but doesn't outdo them. If one actually enjoys watching snuff movies, then this movie is for you."
6324,"It was wonderful and did what music is meant to for movies, setting the moods the score was present in the background but not overwhelming (as in so many other movies lately) the music didn't overshadow the story that was unfolding in any way. Also, Hilary Swank looks a lot like the real Erin Gruwell so that was actually pretty cool. There were actually scenes where the packed theater clapped and cheered, and other times when everyone gasped at the same time. "" Everyone who remembers his own educational experience remembers teachers, not methods and techniques. "" Remember the Titans "", "" Stand and Deliver "", "" Dangerous Minds "", and the list goes on and on."
6340,"The first Hitcher drew its intensity from the aloneness of travelling those massive highways in an attempt to get to your destination without stopping. The major elements from the '86 original are all still in tact here from (SPOILER --- STOP HERE IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE ORIGINAL FILM â€” SPOILER) picking up the Hitcher, kicking him out the door, killing an innocent family, killing cops, and tearing a featured character in half with a semi-truck. This dramatic shift also takes away from John Rider's character and motivations. In the original (MORE SPOILERS IN FACT CONSIDER THIS HOLE REVIEW A SPOILER AND SAVE SOME TIME) Jim inadvertently draws Nash (Jennifer Jason Leigh) into John's machinations and gets romantically involved with her along his arduous journey and meets her demise in the semi truck scene. But the 2007 embalming of Robert Harmon's 1986 masterpiece The Hitcher is the kind of mechanical exercise that gives not only remakes but horror in general a bad name."
6343,"Instead of the brash and rude approach to filming movies, that seems to be the standard today with effects driven movies, Terabithia focuses on the characters, the story, and the heart when telling this beautiful tale. The movie's script greatly aided in the believability of the characters, and the motion of the scenes, which were crisp and well - planned. Instead, Terabithia uses the talents of both the amazing young actors, and its adult cast to enthrall and absorb the viewer in the magic of imagination and the reality of every - day life. Terabithia, a land of beautiful creatures and dangerous enemies, springs forth from their imaginations, and becomes a place to call their own, away from the bullies and monotony of everyday life. The two main characters, Jesse and Leslie (splendidly played by John Hucheson and Annasophia Robb) are typical pre-teens, steering their way through the routine ups and downs kids everywhere deal with, and they develop a friendship / first crush due to their common interests and challenges."
6346,"His scenes with Ms. Russell make up the true heart of this small but mighty film. Shelly herself and Cheryl Hines are solid in their support (Shelly is adorable), but keep the spotlight firmly on Ms. Russell. Keri Russell ("" Felicity "") stars as Jenna, a fabulous pie maker who is a lost soul married to the world's worst husband - played brilliantly by Jeremy Sisto. Outstanding support from Eddie Jemison ("" Ocean's Eleven, Twelve and Thirteen ""), Nathan Fillian ("" Serenity "") and the great Andy Griffith, who has some great lines and definitely should work more often! Jemison's spontaneous poetry capture the heart of Ms. Shelly's character and Fillian's Dr. Pomatter shows Russell what it is like to be adored, rather than abused."
6352,"Do yourself a favor, rent a History channel documentary on the history of documentaries and hit yourself in the head with a hammer. Studio decision - makers have to take a stand against these movies - and so does the industry. Pre-teens, teens and young adults have shown that they have interests in seeing well - written, acted, developed and intelligent movies. Some movies are funny, some are not."
6353,"The actions of this modern - day Yenta the Matchmaker set into motion a whole host of sitcom - level complications and romantic comedy hijinks that are somehow supposed to be funny but wind up being merely irritating. simply because real life mothers and daughters will think they should go see it and laugh that someone's relationship is worse than theirs. especially in L. A. Of course, there is more to this movie than Diane Keaton."
6354,"Following the example of Batman Begins and Casino Royale, Hannibal Rising revolves around the protagonist's early years, trying to convincingly explain why such a brilliant man became a cannibal. As their relationship moves to more complex and dangerous levels, the tormented youngster (Gaspard Ulliel) also becomes fascinated with the study of the human body, and the various tools he learns to use in medical school will come in handy once he discovers Grutas and his men are still alive and decides it's payback time. Gaspard Ulliel did a very good job and has a wonderful look about him. Great locations, great acting--especially by Gaspard Ulliel as Hannibal. Ulliel's finest moment is when Lecter unleashes his unhinged wrath in the climatic scene aboard the river barge; it was thoroughly disturbing."
6355,"Misinformed by the promising cast of "" Norbit "" - Eddie Murphy, Thandie Newton, Clifton Powell, Cuba Gooding Jr. - a whole bunch of talented folk. If you wannasee this movie because the previews look funny, go and see it. This is definitely one a Eddie Murphy's best movies! It's a film aimed for laughs and it does exactly what it delivers."
6358,"Oscar - winning director and screenwriter Brad Bird, who wrote and directed "" The Incredibles "", has produced a film with subtle humor, heart, and very profound truth. It is not as flashy as cars, or as action packed as Incredibles, but it is a masterpiece of restraint and heart, that matches the classics from the golden age of the film industry. Michael Giacchino's score was as perfect for this story as the award - winning one he created for "" The Incredibles "" and the incredible music he has created for most of J. J. Abrams' recent projects, including "" Alias "" and "" Lost "". - The 2D - ish end credits were great. - There were a few moments when they seemed to lose that stylized reality they had established and things looked merely "" real ""."
6362,"When he changes to Ghost Rider, his laughs are impressive, that creates a crazy hero and that is a new and cool feature! If, however, you are the type of person who enjoys some good laughs, some over the top (and at times cheesy) comic book acting, cool battle scenes, action and adventure, or if you simply just like to see some guy with a flaming skull, this is worth the 8 bucks to get into a theater seat. And also even the cops trying to hurt him, he doesn't touch them, because they are innocents, this is a very unique feature too, also humor makes a great addition. The flaming skull effects are believable (well, as believable as flaming skulls get), and most of the bike - riding while on flames scenes hold up well also. There are a good number of laughs in "" Ghost Rider . """
6363,"Gary Cole plays it straight here, and Kathleen Quinlan (as Hanssen's wife) and Bruce Davison (as Eric O'Neill's dad) have brief but effective turns. Cooper does such a great job of capturing Hanssen's intimidation of young Eric O'Neill and his increasing paranoia. On February 18, 2001, Robert Hanssen, a 56 - year old FBI agent, was arrested, by the very agency he worked for, for selling secrets to the Russians. It's true that his performance is a bit of a Johnny - one - note at times, but since the function of the character is that of observer rather than catalyst, Philippe's self - effacing underplaying seems the right editorial choice here. This brings Borroughs to her only recourse â€“ informing O'Neill that Hanssen is everything they claim him to be and more."
6364,"While perhaps doing little more than playing new aspects of themselves, it is a delightful performance, and one backed up with catchy songs, a fabulous debut by Haley Bennett (Cora) and a heartfelt, realistic script. There are three main characters in Music & Lyrics, Grant's Alex, Barrymore's Sophie and the soundtrack which is enjoyable and deceptively catchy. Music & Lyrics is a great romantic comedy. The soundtrack is good fun - pretend 80s songs mix with Cora's modern pop and the Hugh / Drew demo track is nice too. Chances are you are now reaching for the vomit bag or saying that maybe sounds like quite a giggle."
6365,"The acting was tight (though there are a few scenes that fall somewhat flat, as with any movie), the script was well written, and it is pretty spooky. Even the end of the film, when the great question is revealed, it is nice to see it all played out in front of you, and you can really start to see Carrey's inner struggle. And there are times when Joel Schumacher reminds you of what kind of director he really is (Batman & Robin, D. C. Cab), but amazing cinematography and Carrey's performance, as well as the intriguing story / concept, pushes you past all of that. The acting is also good, Carrey has his witty one liners which will please fans. Virginia Madsen also does a great job as Carrey's wife, loving, protective, the whole sha - bang."
6366,"The real - time mockumentary comedy that "" Reno 911 "" represents has been prevalent on television for the past few years and recently it appears as if it's now being a preferred alternative on the big screen as well. What makes Reno 911 funny is the string of endless "" skits "" and scenarios these incompetent cops put themselves in. "" Reno 911: Miami "" ranks as the funniest cop comedy since the Broken Lizard Club's first movie "" Super Troopers . "" No matter: the film does an excellent job of establishing its tone and the specifics of the characters right off the bat. Garcia and Jones investigate an alligator in a backyard swimming pool in what is one of the funniest scenes and get advice from a redneck next door neighbor."
6371,The parts are all cast brilliantly - in particular Pegg and Frost as the two lead police officers. It manages to make fun of ridiculous plots used in action movies and at the same time entertain you with their own ridiculous plot which is quite thrilling! As a parody on action movies this movie succeeds where others have failed! It shows that they actually like the movies they make fun of! It certainly is one of the funniest movies at the moment!
6377,"She makes films more interesting to watch, by dint of her strong performances. "" The Golden Man "" is a much more ordinary story, but with resounding insights on the consequences of his existence. "" moments when the action is at its most intense. Drama, humor, really fine action sequences, twists, great characters. A lot of people say it was boring with no plot twists."
6380,""" Zodiac "" may frustrate viewers who come to David Fincher's latest film expecting a traditional serial killer thriller. Robert Downey, Jr. does characteristically terrific work as a reporter at the "" Chronicle "" who grabs his own portion of notoriety through his involvement in the case. All of the actors deliver thrilling performances, many of them against the odds. He does his best to bring everything to some sort of conclusion, but the real - life end to the story makes a complete conclusion impossible. The main performances are excellent - Robert Downey Jr and Jake Gyllenhaal in particular are a standout."
6381,"Containing a diverse cast that works quite well, a handful of funny cameos, tons of predictable yet enjoyable scenarios, and a rather surprising amount of physical humor; Wild Hogs is a startlingly delightful comedy that isn't afraid to reach low for a laugh. This movie was filled with laughs and good gags. This one had tons of laughs & great sight gags. The laughs in here are present pretty much throughout the film, and it ranges from funny little one - liners, to physical comedy, to lowbrow comedy, to even a bit of absurdity. A couple hilarious scenes with Ray Liotta as a VERY bad boy as he usually plays and John C. McGinley (Dr. Cox from Scrubs)."
6383,"It definitely has a "" new age "" touch, it's mysterious, and with a nice bit of surreal / sci - fi - if you liked movies the same pace and style as K - Pax (though this one is a bit more geared towards kids), then you'll probably like Mimzy. Like Alice before them, their lives are transformed into a fascinating and sometimes dangerous wonderland. In it lies a bunch of fragments, and, oddly enough, a stuffed, fluffy, cute bunny named Mimzy, who Emma takes as her most important possession. Especially liked the little girl's interaction with Mimzy, dressing it in doll clothes, having a tea party. The two kids are also very good at playing their parts, with Wryn as Emma very adept at being vulnerable and smart, and O'Neil being almost too close to looking like the boy Elliot in ET, however not without his own strengths."
6391,"There is some humor, but most of it is really only funny in comparison to the tearjerking moments, as Adam deals with his loss and Don struggles to help him. Adam plays two levels very well. If you are not yet a griever, please take a lesson from his movie and just listen and accept people's choices in their grief, letting them find peace in their own time! Writer / Director Mike Binder has really delivered a story that so many will be able to connect with on numerous levels. Whether that love has caused your relationship to become stagnant, or has brought anger from the one you love cheating for years, or has broken your heart to the point of being unable to open yourself up to the world, love hurts."
6387,"This film may be largely untrue, but what really matters is whether it works on its own terms, qua film. The same clunkingly literal idea â€“ that an artist must experience emotions in order to write about them successfully - underscored Shakespeare in Love, but there it was handled with a rather lighter touch. The script has some witty moments and at least makes a decent stab at realistic 18th century dialogue. Julie Walters excellent as the mother who would give anything to knock some sense into her daughter (Jane Austen that is). A film about Jane Austen, one of the greatest writers of English literature, will garner expectations and hopes, especially with a cascade of stars newly discovered (James McAvoy, Anne Hathaway) and well - established (Julie Walters, Maggie Smith, James Cromwell)."
6389,"She pulled it off with gold stars. The soundtrack was fantastic and right up there with the Sixth Sense in terms of effectiveness; none of it got in the way of the action. It is a fairly well done, thought provoking experience and is carried by some better than average performances by a strong cast. But this is definitely a very good drama, and it's one of those movies that make you think about how important life is."
6390,"It's pretty difficult for horror movies to continually be original, and this certainly has some moments in it. There is some great sets in the film as well. Like SAW (2004), this was written by James Whannell, from a story by himself and director Wan."
6392,"If you were to take the best parts of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan series (Patriot Games, Clear And Present Danger, Sum of All Fears) and mixed in the best parts of the only good Rambo film (First Blood) you would end up with something akin to Shooter. Shooter is a smart, engaging and all out enjoyable action flick that never pulls its punches and always surprises you when you least expect it. The film really puts you into the shoes of a sniper and gives an impressive overview of the mindset that it takes to be as accurate as someone of the character of Swagger. It has always been one of the great mistakes of militaries around the world, to recruit the best young men and train them to kill ruthlessly. Mark Wahlbergs performance was top notch."
6393,"Of course it's not going to be an Oscar nominated film, it's just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for 90 minutes. It's a really good film and, even though an avalanche of new sequels and clones will be inevitable, it's highly unlikely that one of them will ever equal the surprising quality level of Aja's smashing hit. Since you don't care for the amateur G. I. Joe "" heroes "" and definitely don't feel any sympathy for the eyes in the hills, this film is a whole lot less compelling and involving than last year's original. When a group of military trainees are brought to the campsite, they find it deserted with no signs of life. "" The Hills Have Eyes II "" completely lacks â€“ as to be expected â€“ originality, logic and plausible situations."
6394,"TMNT does its job: CGIs are done very nicely, the visual overhaul of the Turtles' design comes near the original comic - look and for a kiddie flick (let's face it TMNTs target audience is well below 14) it is a shade darker, cooler and grown - up than any of the other animation films hitting the Box Office right now. their designs fit in well with the overall look of NY city, which is dark, worn and very impressive. Now, in 2007, Peter Laird, Kevin Munroe and the amazingly talented folks at Imagi Animation Studios deliver what could very well be the movie that everyone has waited for for so long: A film that presents the light - hearted aspects of the 1980's cartoon, and the dark and gritty of the original comics books that started it all, while introducing a brand new story that moves at a pace that's sure to keep new viewers enthralled. the plot is still interesting and fast paced, and the villains are credible. + DESIGN: along the same lines as the animation, the general look and design of everything was pretty cool."
6395,"In the 21st century, there are very few films worth seeing, in comparison to the earlier 80's, and 90's. Although not of the same Hollywood callibur as movies such as Inside Man, it is still easily worth the ticket. In a few narrated scenes at the end, the writer conspires to undo a lot of the hard work. Unable to perform daily tasks normally or think through clearly, Chris manages to stay sane and hope for the better. Jeff Daniels again dons a Beard and steals his scenes, every line of his dialog either makes you laugh, think or just compels the movie forward, and Joseph Gordon Levitt again proves why he is capable of being one of the next great movie stars."
6396,"While it follows the predictable rise, fall, and rise again pattern of most comedies, Blades of Glory is different enough to be memorable. The costumes are ridiculous, the set - pieces are brilliant (including a very awkward chase sequence involving a crossbow and an unfortunate mascot), and the performances, what these films hinge on, are excellent. "") are funny enough to carry the film for large sections. Ferrell and Heder play very well off each other. The story is simple: arch rivals Chazz (Will Ferrell) and Jimmy (Jon Heder) are forced to become figure skating partners after they are banned from competing in singles skating."
6397,All of the actors' performances were right on and the action directing was excellent. grind house as a whole had a great concept but fell short off the glory thanks in part to the usually surefire Tarentino. it had all the clichÃ©s that you would see in old school horror flicks and was incredibly entertaining. then in between the two movies were the trailers which were die hard funny. all in all grind house had a good concept with a good first film packed with hilarious trailers but Tarentino's pitiful effort just sucks the life out of the whole experience.
6398,"It offers a number of nice surprises and even a good plot twist or two without causing too much of the old time - traveling headache. The humor also works quite well, although many of the jokes seem to be aimed at adults and little kids might not get all of them. A heartwarming story with eye - popping 3D special effects. The story is strong, so you will enjoy it either way, but since 3D is a rare instance in this day & age, you should go that route. This movie has a stellar cast that may not be the big A-list names like the Dreamworks movies, but they are very talented and well cast in their roles."
6400,"From the jaw dropping opening sequence to the fantastically realised final moments, Boyle's latest is a mighty treat for the eyes. And to top it all, on a ship rather ominously named' Icarus II'. Recently seen in a similarly hot headed role in the undercooked comic book adaptation' Fantastic Four', he consistently snatches scenes from Murphy as engineer Mace, about as volatile and fiery as Cappa is composed and cool. Without Evan's energetic performance, the film would sink into an anti-libidinal quag. Mace's emotive instability injects pace when it's needed and brings some welcome variety to the otherwise glum faces."
6403,"Rowena's having a tough time after she quits her job due to one of her stories falling through and a childhood friend of hers named Grace (Nicki Aycox) turns up dead. The answer exists simply in whatever of the three endings worked out the best. The film improves somewhat in the middle, with a couple of tense scenes (like the one in the car with Willis suspecting Berry of being a spy, or Berry's entrance into Ribisi's "" secret room ""), and a few interesting (if brief) views of the net - chatting world. Bruce Willis has a couple of good scenes, but the rest of the time he pretty much sleepwalks through his role. Bruce Willis and Halle Berry have acted much better in past, but are watchable regardless, as well as Giovanni Ribisi; suspense thriller is made bearable but eventually degenerates."
6404,"What makes this movie better than most horror movies that are released today is that is doesn't rely on excessive gore and gross out tactics to frighten you. Everything in this movie is done well. It had a new and fresh feeling with teens and it worked, despite how it seemed a bit more predictable than Rear Window, it still was pretty clever. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and will make you ask questions over and over again, those are always the thrillers that are worth seeing. Stripped of his mod cons (iTunes and xBox Live go out the window), he turns his attentions outside, and learns some disturbing truths about his suburban neighbourhood in a sinister take on the voyeuristic aspects of modern life."
6405,"The only redeeming feature of this movie were the well made action scenes (not all were good, but overall there were more enjoyable fight sequences than boring ones). In that respect, the film offers some depth to the little story that is filled with violent battle scenes. Scenes start and end with absolutely no flow. Most of "" Pathfinder "" is given over to ridiculous chases and fights that remind you how skillful "" Apocalypto "" was at similar scenes. German director Marcus Nispel, who remade "" The Texas Chainsaw Massacre "" a couple of years back and likely is working on a lousy new version of something else now, has an eye: The film is handsome."
6406,"Without giving too much away, from the old school 80s style death metal intro on to the end, the movie is hilarious. Frylock is the logical and responsible one, Master Shake is abrasive and aggressive yet lacking common sense or intelligence (very much like a teenager who thinks jackass is brilliant programming and deems himself intelligent for knowing good TV when he sees it) and Meatwad, who is naive and irresponsible, but otherwise good hearted and just along for the ride. From the days of Bunuel and Dali to the years of Fellinni and Lynch to be followed by the genius that is The Aqua Teen Hunger Force. After the beginning musical sequences, there is a story set in New York thousands of years ago at 3 PM in 1492 which appears to take place in Egypt. Space Ghost C2C (which many of the ATHF producers worked on before this) was brilliant for it's pauses."
6408,"La MÃ´me documents each stage of Edith Piaf's life with creative direction and an intense performance by its lead actress, Martion Cotillard. It truly is a beautiful work of art, coated with sweeping tracking shots Ã¡ la Paul Thomas Anderson or Martin Scorsese blended with shakycam to capture the fast, fickle pace of the business, endlessly creative intercutting of continuity and breathtaking scenes after another. When Piaf's beautiful hands have been noted, a muted performance is given in which the camera only focuses on her theatrics and hand gestures. Yet the best scene takes place in Piaf's apartment some 2 / 3s into the film in which she is waiting for her lover Marcel to fly in from Morocco. La MÃ´me is a one - woman - show in all respects, with Cotillard shamelessly relegating every other cast member to the background with her emotional intensity."
6409,"Besides being an entertaining crime movie, the most interesting element of "" Fracture "" is a struggle of wills and intellects between two main characters, self - made inventor - millionaire Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) who shot his unfaithful wife in the face and put her in a coma and young, successful and smart assistant D. A. Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling), who has a 97% conviction rate and is assigned to prosecute Crawford just when he is ready to accept a lucrative offer from the prestigious LA law firm. The game of cat and mouse that highly intelligent and malevolent Crawford plays with Beachum makes the film interesting and the scenes between Hopkins (in his "" playful Dr. Lector "" mode) and Gosling (whose character does change as he realizes what he is dealing with from the unsympathetic self - centered hot shot to the man who becomes obsessed by the case, vows to put the murderer behind the bars and makes it his priority) - riveting and joy to watch. Strathairn's Lobuto is so interesting that he could be a main character in another move. If you like courtroom dramas, appreciate excellent acting and an expertly - filmed movie this is for you. This is just a fabulous movie with Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling playing battling characters who engage in a battle of wits."
6413,"When the kid later on tells Meg Ryan that he thinks her husband must be out of his mind to be cheating on her, (although he doesn't even really know her at all and is just turned on by this hot milf who seems to love for some reason being around him) she tilts her head all puppy dog style and basks in the glow of the compliment. Scenes between him and the grandmother were hilarious. Just the right touch of someone who is more than they seem, and not realizing that themselves. While still fantastic, you should expect a film about real people (with many flaws and weaknesses that humans have, like the inability to to stand up for themselves) not a movie like "" She's All That "" where the two young, good - looking people fall in love with an epic romance. Never mind anything that is going to make a women swoon with his charm and charisma."
6414,"Part of Mr. Bean's humor is when something is about to happen, you can see it from a mile away, and you yell at the screen "" look out Mr. Bean! "" So ignore the haters and enjoy a laugh out loud joke every 5 minutes or so. The over-the-top body language, the facial expressions, and the convincing vibe you get from Bean that, well, the lights are on but there's nobody home - you can't bring all of this to a character if you're not a good actor. It is also absolutely hilarious and, thank god, unlike the original movie this one doesn't recycle gags from the TV series. After a quiet last couple of years, Rowan Atkinson returns to the big screen in what will probably be the last outing for Mr. Bean."
6415,"Justin Chatwin and Margarita Levieva are incredibly believable and both seem to really enjoy the material. It went past the usual story line of romance and macho heros, but looked deeper. Apparently the other reviewers don't have the ability to see past explosions and fake fights in films to see the depth portrayed in this movie. This is a remake of the Swedish movie' Den Onsynlige' and there is no doubt that its worth your time. If you think you can figure this movie out by the synopsis above, think again -' The Invisible' is a epic story about life, death and the choices you make during your time on this Earth."
6416,"One has to bear in mind that The Condemend is wwe production so don't go expecting some massive work of art with lots drama, action and a deep plot that will make you think - NO! However having said that it has got all the ingredients in it to keep fans of the action genre connected and the story just picks up and moves on at a good pace with action to keep you hooked in. It's a bit like the well - known fact that the most vociferous anti-porn campaigners also happen to own the biggest collections of porn! Although much of the violence is not right in your face in parts it does carry on that bit long although this is used to separate the "" no morals, no borders "" team from the good guys within the production cast. Most of the fight scenes in the movie are great, and there's plenty of fights, action and explosions going on non-stop throughout the movie."
6417,"Spiderman's one - on - one fight with the Sandman and the crane scene being the major highlights. The intrepid Parker is on top of the world as N. Y. C. citizens have finally come to appreciate all of his heroic deeds, but more importantly he's found a stable relationship with Mary Jane Watson. Some effective moments of intense, exciting action and superior special effects are undermined by overlength, and juxtaposed against moments of corny, unintentionally funny human drama. The ingredients for a success are there, including a good cast and some interesting subplots, but they can't overcome a leaden script which chooses to revel in its mawkish material rather than flesh out its characters or tell a coherent story. Unlike the two superior predecessors, it felt like they were trying to cram three movies into one with "" Spider - Man 3 ""."
6426,"Anyways if you want a few sophomoric laughs and decent acting, this is OK. "" Freaks and Geeks "" lives on through multiple tie - ins - not the least of which is writer / director and producer Judd Apatow (best known for his smash hit "" 40 Year Old Virgin ""). Both films based their story on a simple premise (a nerdy 40 year old hasn't had sex, a guy has a one night stand and gets the woman pregnant), but it seems like 40 Year Old Virgin used its idea to just get laughs. Much of what is wrong with Knocked Up is simply an over-reliance on Seth Rogen to deliver the laughs. Most comedies tend to fall apart part - way through, but this one kept the laughs going."
6443,"Even if "" Paranoid Park "" isn't your cup of tea, one has to admit GVS is a rarity among established contemporary American filmmakers: he has, through the years, been brave enough to stick to his thematic obsessions (young male beauty, the loneliness of non-conformism, the failure of the American dream and the traditional family, the complexity that lies under the apparent numbness and superficiality of American teens), and put them in films that--while certainly not for all tastes--get more fascinating as they get more personal and self - revelatory by refusing to be "" big "". Warm electronic tones and burblings envelope a continuous slow - motion camera shot of skateboarders as they rove around the the curves and angles of the park and the effect is really quite magical."
6427,"Nikki Blonsky premiered beautifully as the spunky and voluptuous Tracy Turnblad. The candy colored costumes and thrilling choreography were so enjoyable, and even the more serious parts of the film (though there are very few!) While it would have been a great addition, other big song and dance numbers carried the film along just fine. The very convincing fat F / X makeup and prosthetics (Edna may be overweight, but she's got womanly curves in all the right places) don't get in the way of fleet - footed Travolta's fabulous dancing. The plot's serious aspects, with its foreshadowing of the era's more sobering issues, are woven deftly into the movie's high spirits."
6428,"The mother, who is a carrier of the disease but shows no symptoms due to a genetic abnormality, is a precious commodity as she may contain the secrets to a cure. The movie contained everything it needed to be become a classic horror movie. The movie starts off well with the jumps and the pulse pounding action. But with all the action you'll still be on the edge of your seat, and the jumps to tell you truth are an added incentive. The actions scenes are masterfully done, effectively placing the viewer in the points of view of both the victims and the crazed, but still scarily human, zombies."
6431,"To its credit, there were several very clever scenes. The desire to produce a film merely ended up as a plot device to get Shrek and Fiona back to their beloved swamp. With the passing of King Harold, Shrek and Fiona are heirs to the throne of Far, Far Away. Shrek The Third is another entertaining romp through the erstwhile Hollywood of Far Far Away with a few laughs for adults and a few more for kids. Predictably, both of these eventualities play pretty dissonantly on the big green guy's insecurities, and he goes a-questing to locate the next - in - line of succession - a young, dejected, high school kid."
6432,"It is bittersweet and romantic, with great music (not Irish music, but the singer / songwriter type) as the two main characters collaborate on their songs and help each other become stronger and face the romantic challenges they both are suffering from. Archaic, unrequited, love, universally known and unknown, and as a friend said about the movie and its songs: no great art came from happiness. The primary actors are musicians and their songs tie the movie together and tie you to them. John Carney has directed and written a brilliant film which tags at your heart and makes your feet dance all at the same time. "" Guy and Girl "" are tremendous in their parts and the humor and passion they bring to their music."
6433,"The characters are surprisingly likable, and Depp comes roaring in like a breath of fresh air as Capt. Jack. This kind of films destroy the film as an art, as something beautiful, something that can wheedle the emotions out of you, something that you'll think about and remember for a long time. Less than a year after the previous installment of the popular pirates trilogy, Jack Sparrow and company return in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. Sparrow, Barbossa, Beckett, Norrington, Jones, and Gibbs provided some very good acting and funny moments."
6434,"This is an assault to the mind, not the eyes, and it's exceptionally well done. ' Mr. Brooks', 2007's first true psychological thriller, features an all star cast with Kevin Costner, Demi Moore, Dane Cook, and William Hurt. He has it all, a beautiful wife, a wonderful company, an awesome home, and a daughter (Danielle Panabaker) in college. He loves killing, mostly because of the maniacal representation of his temptations and desires: Marshall (Oscar Winner William Hurt). Costner has been everyone's hero the past 2 decades, but Costner totally breaks the mold with a daring and riveting performance as the conflicted, murderous, yet loving Mr. Brooks."
6464,"No, its not fine art, its a summer comedy, and it delivers plenty of laughs. If you are into absurdest humor, or enjoyed movies like Hot Fuzz, or Super Troopers, you'll find plenty to enjoy. Laughs are frequent, everyone at the cinemas was laughing. A good performance, a Hilarious Andy Samberg and cast, and the beautiful Isla Fisher is always nice to watch. Along with Lonely Island best friends Akiva Shaffer as director and Jorma Taccone as his step - brother team up to create this great comedy equals pure awesomeness!"
6435,"This film is more about a family as it copes with tragedy and life in the 70's than it is about soccer, which is a good thing! That is a common, obvious message, but ask yourself how many movies are delivering that message to girls without also referring, whether overtly or by implication, to appearance and sexuality. Although it has many of the hallmarks of a Lifetime Original Movie - souped - up gender conflict, an overdose of sentimental uplift, and a plucky, inspirational heroine at its core - "" Gracie, "" which is set in late 1970's New Jersey, transcends many of its stereotypes and clichÃ©s through heartfelt performances, unpretentious writing and earnest direction. She's instantly likable and she transmits emotions through her face, voice, and body like she was born to convince you of her champion heart."
6437,"And details like the crazy burger (where the bun is on the inside and the hamburger patties are on the outside) are just so priceless. Eagle Vs. Shark is a quirky comedy from New Zealand, with "" Flight Of The Conchords "" Jermaine Clement, and a cast of unknowns."
6438,"Pacino seems completely uninterested, his dialogues and general acting deprived of the slightest intensity or wit. "" 88 Minutes "" is a movie of stunning badness. You will not be blown away but you will be entertained for the hour and 42 minutes it runs."
6440,""" Ocean's Thirteen "" is not about logic or plausibility or realism, it is all about fun and entertaining and it entertains admirably. The formula worked well in the first two movies. Soderbergh is no doubt hoping the good will audiences have for his characters from the first film is still in place here (sorely tested in Oceans Twelve). It does look great in parts - the set design and CGI work is impeccable - and Soderbergh, holding his own camera under the name' Peter Andrews', shoots his cast and the locales sumptuously in deep, rich reds and golden tones. But of course this is still the original elevens' movie, and all of them get their moments to shine."
6444,"Set amidst these beautiful backdrops is a bevy of lovable, genuinely hilarious characters. The supporting characters too are a delight, with Zooey Deschanel as a Baywatch lifeguard babe and James Woods as a sports tzar, and Jon Heder continues his stereotype by playing Cody's new best friend Chicken Joe, a chilled out surfing chicken who finds himself at probably the wrong place each time and associating with the wrong species. En route to the competition, Cody comes into contact with talent scout, Mikey Abromowitz (Mario Cantone), whose neurosis run through his head almost as fast as his little bird legs run on land and an oddball surfer / rooster named Chicken Joe (Jon Heder), who is as laid back (read potentially stoned) as one would expect a surfer to be. The voice talent is perfect: Jeff Bridges as the laid back Z, Shia LaBeouf the young hero in the making, Jon Heder as a stoned chicken from Michigan, and Zooey Deschanel as the good - hearted lifeguard who keeps secrets well. Due to the recent release of penguin movies, a lot of people are turned off by them."
6445,"But it wasn't so bad either; it's just that after Marvel Comics' recent domination of the film genre, it's natural for one to expect that each of its characters having a shot at the big screen would present something legitimately entertaining to the audience. In "" Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, "" the four superheroes are back once again to help everyone solve their gamut of problems. In addition to this, Victor Von Doom aka Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon) returns and is intent on destroying the Fantastic Four. Gruffudd does an okay job with Mr. Fantastic but there's really no feeling of chemistry between him and Alba, who manages to adequately portray a tough yet vulnerable character. You get a glimpse of the cosmicness, but the people are the important thing."
6446,"The actors in the movies made the whole thing exciting and funny. OK there are a couple scary moments that are resolved in short order, but parents with young children should sit tight, the movie moves on to better things. Taking old collection of stories poses a challenge for the production team, how can this classic character be brought up to date and make it interesting enough to capture a new audience while stirring memories from her former audience. What makes the movie quite entertaining is the little details, as she discovers that her customary world is nothing compared to the California scene, and this is well presented, without resorting to unnecessary vulgar language or anything graphic or overtly sexual. Emma Roberts is an old fashioned girl, who believes in good behavior and respect for others; details that are sorely missing from today's films."
6448,Russel is awesome here and has a great way of becoming charming to chilling in a matter of seconds.
6465,Why are the previews so blah for a movie that is so awesome! Claire Danes is fantastic as always. Michelle Pfiefer is making quite a splash with her recent returns to the screen. There are also a lot of wonderful moments from minor characters. People of all ages will enjoy it.
6453,"It's widely known that, despite being one of the richest countries in the world, the states is far from best when it comes to taking care of their own."
6454,"Tudyk and Dinklage have the showiest parts and they feast on them. Both A Wedding and DaaF are both off beat, extremely, funny, and very non-typical of weddings and funerals, in which they both portray. Comedy is edgy enough for teens to enjoy although overall it will probably appeal to slightly older audiences. Memorable performances from Andy Nyman playing neurotic fool Howard and straight man Matthew MacFadyen make this a real crowd pleaser. If you go to a sporting event, after you have paid for your ticket and bought your seat, people around you cheer, yell, scream and sometimes even in funny costumes as well."
6455,"The place holds about 5, 000 seats and it was packed. These explosive scenes are a seamless composite of fantastic, real world stunt work, and exceptional CGI. And of course, Timothy Olyphants black steering eyes are still full of rage and anger, as they was in Deadwood. Good old stunt work and explosions, thank God. All of the other characters are clichÃ©s too - Timothy's ice cold bad guy, Maggie Q's brainy, beautiful, femme fatale, the FBI head who for some unknown reason can't understand what's going on or get anything done, but John McClane can work everything out no problem, even without the resources of the whole FBI to help, all he needs is a phone and a gun!"
6456,"The audience was a good mix of older couples, young marrieds, teenage girls, a few stray singles, a family or two--a well - rounded audience, let's say. Mandy Moore and John Krasinski are cute, but very flat characters. License to Wed is neither terrible nor wonderful. The movie neither humorously avoids morals, nor does it end with moral enlightenment. Young lovers Ben Murphy (John Krasinski) and Sadie Jones (Mandy Moore) have just made plans to take their relationship to the next level and get married."
6457,"Steve Carell reprises his role as Evan Baxter in this sequel to Bruce Almighty. Evan Almighty is predictable on every turn, and has enough humor to satisfy. Steve Carell does an exceptionally adequate job of delivering very humorous dialogue, which in his style is sure to be adlibbed in great part. The sheer amounts of animals in this film are overwhelming and a treat to behold. If only there was a little less of his family, a little more of Carell, Molly Shannon and maybe some other SNL cast, it could have actually been a lot more entertaining."
6488,"Nicely shoot with some great camera movement Wan is shooting stuff to pieces almost like Hong Kong directors did in the early '90s. Kevin Bacon delivers nicely and adds a whole new facet to the dad - on - a-rampage character. As for the thugs, they're all hilarious - a bunch of didn't - quite - make - the - cut extras from a circa - 1997 nÃ¼ - metal video shoot and should be filed under' outdated badass' at Central Casting Come on, tribal tattoos and facial piercings! If you ever wanted to exact revenge on someone in your own mind or in your dreams go see this movie it is great. Someone who has never handled guns before becomes an expert marksman by reading the manuals."
6458,"The robot vs. robot fight scenes were, in a word, remarkable. It seemed like the actors were actually interacting with real, 50 foot tall robots during the movie. It's a good thing that the robots do work. Seeing autobots and decepticons in glorious photo - realistic CGI is enough to wring out any childhood fantasy from anybody (not just boys from the 80s). And unlike the other blockbusters that have came out this year, these effects have a sense of weight that adds so much to the visual satisfaction."
6459,"In this respect, Order of the Phoenix was very similar to the previous two movies. As a Hollywood film, it deserves praise, bringing this amazing world to the big screen, telling a compelling tale, and keeping the viewers glued to their seats for the duration of the movie. The same goes for Gambon, who seems to have ignored the calm, all knowing, endearing idea of who Dumbledore is, in favor of a more erratic yet powerful headmaster. Percy doesn't speak at all, and Malfoy has literally one line in the whole film."
6460,"Throughout the movie their relationship is under fire and it's up to their attorney, Alex (Jessica Beal), who believes they're gay, to save them from criminal charges. Everyone they know starts treating them differently and they are witness to the discrimination homosexuals face on a regular basis. There are numerous cameos, by some of everyone's favorites, and they show up at some of the most random times making their appearance in the movie that much funnier. while stereotypes are made fun of, they don't really educate, clarify, or any similar, and that, to the gay community is something very crucial at this point of the history. At times it had it's moments and had some funny jokes but it really drags and don't know how to quit."
6461,"It's a bizarre and beautiful movie musical, almost a music video at times, that uses thirty - three of The Beatles' songs and director Julie Taymor's unique visual style to illustrate both a personal love story and the overall conflict in the sixties. The movie is incredibly original and ambitious, and therefore its failings are as dramatic as its successes. Some songs are impeccably chosen and staged with great creativity, but others are too obvious, or thematically forced so Taymor can cram in another song and stunning visual sequence. Even when the context was vague or stretched, the film's reinterpreting and revealing new facets of these songs seemed to serve as a tribute to their breadth and greatness. Imperfections, however glaring, become endearing quirks once you've tumbled."
6467,"The simpsons movie is witty, fast paced, touching, hugely entertaining and most importantly: laugh out loud funny. And if your a simpsons fan who's loved every episode, thats all you'll need from it. The animation and production values are awesome. If you see a review from a person who says that this was the funniest movie ever and non-stop laughs, etc. they probably weren't born before 1990 and haven't seen any Simpsons episodes pre-2000 because there's no way any hardcore tried and true Simpsons fan would have come to that conclusion after seeing this. There were some funny moments, yes, but nothing comparable to the brilliant one - liners from the show's glory years."
6468,"In Mostly Martha, the food came alive - every scene was filmed in such a way you could taste it with your eyes - the smells, the textures. The original had poignant moments, perfectly punctuated with an incredible soundtrack. There are some amazing close up scenes that really grab the attention of the audience with the emotions and captivating context of the scenes, the color motif is brilliant. If you are looking for a break from the so - called Summer "" action "" films, "" No Reservations "" is not very original, but it certainly fits the bill. "" No Reservations "" is delightfully sweet, with a nice romance supported by the magnificent chemistry of Catherine Zeta - Jones and Aaron Eckhart; a good story; a wonderful soundtrack; and the visual of splendorous dishes."
6469,"But he brings an especially charming quality to the role which plays perfectly against Charlie's leanings toward the dark side. In conclusion, this is an entertaining movie that is worthy just to watch Downey Jr. and Yelchin acting together. But Jon Poll, directing from a Gustin Nash script, takes on the task and turns in a hybrid of a film that is so incredibly engaging you'll wonder why few filmmakers take on such a challenge. He does a beautiful job expressing his character's many and layered emotions. At times it all feels so real, and it's no wonder--writer Gustin Nash actually continued to write scenes and dialogue specifically for those actors after the film got underway and it shows."
6470,"The camera shakes, but remains steady enough for you to see everything and feel like you're there with Bourne as he tries to elude his pursuers, and the performances are so good that these guys seem as though they are the characters they're portraying, instead of just being actors performing well - written roles. The Bourne movies have always had a strict focus on the storyline more than the action sequences, this isn't to say the trilogy lacks action sequences, good god no there's loads of them dotted all throughout the movies. The fights between Bourne and the assassins are always fun to watch. Even the little guys do a wonderful job, like Paddy Considine as the reporter who starts the leak at the center of everything, Albert Finney as a man from Bourne's past and possibly key to his origin, and Edgar Ramirez as one of the CIA's operatives sent to take Bourne out. This film stands far above the other two Bourne movies, and is definitely one of the best movies of the 2007 summer season!"
6471,"It also makes for some ample absurd moments when just seeing the four Bratz having a fight amongst themselves about sticking together or going off into their other interests (naturally, they have only one aptitude a piece, one soccer, one cheer - leading, one science, and one journalism / singing), and as well the diabolical attempts to thwart all of their fun by the nasty, less than one - note daughter of the principle, who goes for a 2nd super sweet sixteen party even after she's turned 16. What were you expecting, an intriguing story, deep, heartfelt emotional scenes, from The Bratz movie? And while the film tries to touch on friendships being key, the main message here is that only thin, good - looking people are worth anything; and the only way to make a difference in the world is to wear the latest, most expensive fashions. Friends, the combined talent of the entire cast and crew of "" Bratz "" could be put in a thimble and there would still be room for Rosie O'Donnell's butt. Yes that's right, according to this guy the film Bratz is a perfect masterpiece with impeccable acting, dialogue and story, backed up by Oscar worthy directing and screenplay."
6478,"His fights fall short compared to other the movies he has done, but for a movie like this they are considerably good. Rush Hour 3 sees Inspector Lee and Detective Carter back together again, trying to save the lives of a Chinese ambassador who may be on the brink of cracking open a massive organized crime syndicate called the Triads, the ambassador's daughter, and a woman with a very dangerous secret. Most of this takes place in Paris, providing a different setting and a few opportunities to exploit cultural stereotypes that are new to the series. The film is jam - packed with the wild, mildly provocative humor the series is known for, and the silly but entertaining martial - arts slapstick that is Mr. Chan's trademark. This one seems to have plenty of more laughs and an even more exiting climax towards the end of the movie than the previous two."
6473,"Her facial expressions, comic timing, and interplay with Kingsley as she learns the truth about his past are pure gold. Leoni has had her fair share of commercial successes ("" Bad Boys, "" "" Deep Impact, "" "" The Family Man "", and "" Jurassic Park III "") but it's in this type of offbeat low - budget comedy where she really shines. While the film goes through the predictable motions in its final act, it's the gooey goodness of the middle portion (especially one laugh - out - loud montage of Leoni helping Kingsley train for his return to "" work "") that will leave a smile on your face, with Leoni's luminosity as a comedic actress scorched into your mind. Everything out of his mouth is carefully orchestrated and he is not one to waste his own or others' time. This fact makes some scenes hilarious because of the reactions from those he is speaking to."
6476,"It had its completely gross - out teen moments, but those were grounded by its hilariously absurd and witty (also gross) conversations. Cera, Hill (who deserves special praise, for turning what could have been a really unlikeable character into a sweet, if loud - mouthed and crass, teenager) and Mintz - Plasse bounce of each other perfectly. The performances all around are pretty funny, even if the Fogell / McLovin pop culture references are ruining a good joke (kind of like "" Yeah, baby! "" Jonah Hill is the funniest he has ever been, confidently spouting out uproariously funny lines at every hot girl in sight. Also,' McLovin' Fogell, is an absolute nerdy delight."
6477,"Dieing in his early 50's from lung cancer is a sad denouement to a life that had been broadcasting iconic when he simply told it the way it was from a little studio that let him speak effectively to his people about rights and pride. It has a great mixture of humor (especially the unbeatable Don Cheadle as Petey and his wife Vernell) combined with a very strong and breathtaking story of the time around the death of Martin Luther King Junior. He wins over Dewey Hughes (Chiwetel Ejiofor), the slick, smart program director who is revealed to be a lot less of an stiff than he appears. Don Cheadle as Petey and Chiwetel Ejiofor as his "" Mr. Tibbs "" manager, Dewey Hughes, are the acting team of the year, initially despising each other, needling each other to be more than they are, comforting each other in down times, and ultimately responsible for the major successes and failures of their lives. Overall the acting is solid and on the money, again with Cheadle and Ejiofor showing deft acting chops with versatility of drama and comedy."
6623,"As Temudjin's father (poisoned by Tatars before the boy reached 10), Sai Xing Ga makes an impression few actors can achieve in such a brief appearance. What really makes this film great are the performances and the action scenes. That's true for everyone but the Mongols. And instead of a series of fighting scenes, the highs and the lows really made for a very full movie. The performances are passable â€“ with special thanks to Honglei Sun, with an engaging turn as Temudjin's long - time friend and ally Jamukha â€“ but the film has a rushed quality to it that is predominantly the fault of the screenplay."
6479,"James Hong gives one of the funniest performances ever. In all honesty, what can you expect when you take a poor man's Jack Black and give him the starring role in a poor man's Dodgeball? It'll be on TNT or TBS soon enough so just have patience and watch a few legitimately good comedies in the interim. True, some of the laughs were simply because some people were in this movie that had NO BUSINESS being in it, because they are considered to belong to a higher echelon of movies. A lot of the humor is based in uncomfortable moments."
6480,"there is a great mix of characters with odd quirks, and Armada Bynes is so likable it's hard not to like the movie. overall, a very entertaining 100 plus minutes. It was a great blend of an old story with modern college life with clever, roll - your - eyes references to the original Disney animated film. What Amanda Bynes is so good at is delivering clean and funny teen and family comedies. This movie is a rarity, genuine humor is displayed throughout the film without using sex jokes / raunchiness references."
6481,"While Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Garner, Chris Cooper and Jason Bateman all get top billing, the real star of this story is Ashraf Barhom who plays Saudi police Col. Al - Ghazi, a man dedicated to his profession, with an acute sense of fair play, protocol and justice. From there, the audience is treated to a top notch story that nicely touches on everything from culture clashes, forensic revelations, kidnapping, religious doctrine, and the self perpetuation of hate, all of which culminates in a final half hour of riveting, vicious, blood spattering action. There are a few surprises, some forensic elements and the flick bears some resemblance to Syriana, that was a well done film. The gripping opening montage documents the connection between the U. S. A. and Saudi Arabia and sucks you right into the story."
6482,"The very impressive fast - paced and garbled speech that Anna and Nicholas D'Agosto (Ben in the film), as well as the other debaters in the film have to employ is incredible. This film is very unpredictable, which is very nice as this film does not follow the fairy tales that are so common in film today. The crew did a most convincing job of turning South East Baltimore into Trenton, NJ and turning the suburbs of MD into those of NJ. Speaking of the music, The Violent Femmes are all over the place and their songs of Love Angst match perfectly with the entire flow and story of the film. For a truly uplifting, however, realistic experience that will certainly make you laugh and impress as well, go see Rocket Science when it releases on August 10th."
6483,"An excellent actor who has never made it big, Gant almost manages to make his scenes work. This abomination of a movie somehow manages to feature a great actor, Cuba Gooding, Jr., in by far his worst role yet. Along the way, he must resolve problems with his father and show his son that he really loves him. As for the rest of the protagonists, they are a group of people you will hope will fail, mainly because the kids are obnoxious stereotypes."
6484,"If your not a fan or have never seen any other versions you might think it is OK. Don Siegel's "" Invasion of the Body Snatchers "" is one of the best sci - fi ever, therefore most of the remakes are good because the story of earth being invaded through replicas of the human beings is excellent. It had two big stars, an acclaimed director, a big time producer, and a time tested premise. To create a world in which everyone is equal, rational, no war, no disease, no famine, no inequality is what the body snatchers are offering."
6485,"There's even one with motorcycles. Need to see a movie that rocks for a change. Revenge and Yakuza are usually great themes for action movies. , long range to up - close - and personal, swords into mouths and through back of head and through just about any other body part, a car chase, motorcycle chases, a few bare breasts and a bunch of attention - grabbing scenes of brutality, which definitely outnumber the quieter scenes. There are a lot of postings about this being a "" guy "" movie, or needing a "" pair of testicles "" to enjoy it."
6486,""" The Nanny Diaries "" is entertaining the entire time. "" The Nanny Diaries "" is absolutely mandatory viewing for Scarlett Johansson fans. It had great acting, a solid story, and whiles not being original had its own unique charms that makes it a very enjoyable movie. She's not featured an awful lot in the movie, but the small doses of her are well acted. Instead of going all over emotional, she simply just lets a tear fall down her face and that simple tear just nails everything she's feeling at that moment."
6487,"One of the most significant updates to the "" Halloween "" legend is the development of Dr. Loomis, the Van Helsing to Meyers' Dracula. There are some good performances, particularly by Malcolm McDowell, who plays Dr. Loomis, but his part is profoundly damaged by the script, so even he looks foolish in the film. The best moments come early, between young Michael and his mother (both played very well)."
6489,"Saying it skims the line of reality and mockumentary comes with the territory - after a while watching Mitchell is like watching someone who's improvising as he goes along, hiding behind his perfectionist guise as a world - class champ and purveyor of fine hot sauces with his fake - buxom wife and lackeys watching every move Steve makes. The mock - epic tone, which so many supporting characters delightfully contribute to, feels seized by director Seth Gordon and infused into his charming take on good - vs - evil, letting this potentially inspiring metaphor stretch it's wings into a blossomed, well - rounded quirk-fest far more fun then it's rigorous gaming pedigree would suggest. It is a journey that takes you through the darker and seedier side of the video game revolution of the '80s. Though this geeky arcade fighting flick may remain an acquired taste, The King of Kong feels like one of the more entertaining documentaries to emerge in years. This is an incredible documentary, and as with most great documentaries the story arises as the filming happens; it is not preconceived."
6491,"From the exploitative opening credits through to the final frames of the film, this is a roller coaster ride of a film that doesn't let up. The cast that Rodriguez assembled is a glorious ensemble of bygone action heroes, horror icons, and Rodriguez stock actors. It was wonderfully exciting and filled with great action parts, hilarious tongue - in - cheek humor, and non-stop entertainment."
6492,"Cinematically, this film ranks up there with the best westerns of all time. In many respects this is a traditional western (it is a remake, after all). If you like westerns you'll love this. If this is the best the studios can do with Westerns then they should forget about making them. 3: 10 to Yuma is a true Western in the American film tradition about the 19th - century American West: It has clear heroes and villains (and a mixture of those), wide prairies, dirty towns, fast guns, weak lawmen, cunning murderers, kids on the cusp, and women marginalized, just for starters."
6493,"It's the funniest, coolest, most amazing mix of stunts, bad one liners and paper think plot lines. SHOOT 'EM UP is well named: this is a whompingly good action movie that is as much parody of its genre as it is a good story. Writer / director Michael Davis has found his niche and let's hope their will be more dark comedies that are as much fun to watch as this one. A smarmy gangster Hertz (Paul Giamatti in another career forming role), connected to an illicit arms manufacturer Hammerson (Stephen McHattie), is in pursuit of both Smith and the baby for reasons that are finally disclosed: the baby is part of a ring of potential bone marrow donors for an important Senator. The dialog is peppered with hilarious one - liners that have a real edge and the methods of the endless killings include several using the carrot that Smith keeps at hand as a weapon."
6495,"Essentialy the film is about a lie that Briony tells, and how it affects the lives of her, Cecilia, and most importantly of all, Robbie. Superb performances, beautiful direction, a script and storyline to die for. She has improved massively since the first pirates film. The film is cleverly done with jumps in time and different perspectives of events throughout which will leave you understanding the motives of each character more. The music is composed beautifully, the orchestral tunes accompanied with the clatter that a typewriter makes creates a beautiful piece of music that fits perfectly with the film itself."
6496,"Influences become clear as never before, Maddin's ambisexuality is on display (1995s Sissy Slap Boy Party now makes sense), "" La Roue "" (1923 / Abel Gance) is revealed as his cinematic touchstone (following on from the quotation in "" Odilon Redon - or The Eye Like a Strange Balloon Mounts Toward Infinity "", also 1995). The movie is almost like a coming out, a cry of freedom, a love letter to all he holds dear, ice hockey, Winnipeg, silent cinema, sexuality, proletarian utopias, family memories. "" There is something universal about the film, Maddin incants a litany of opprobrium and indignity that the city of Winnipeg has suffered, from the demolition of an iconic department store, to the closure of two underground swimming pools and the hockey stadia. Maddin uses the imagery of horses, as have many great artists from Raphael, to Gericault, to Marc, to Parajanov. Guy Maddin mixes fact and fiction (as he's wont to do) to make a sort - of documentary about Winnipeg, his home and geographical Oedipal complex."
6497,"Gabita's predicament and subsequent journey both physically and mentally are what drives the film but its shown mainly through the eyes of her friend and roommate Otilia who as well as making and carrying out the arrangements has to make some startling sacrifices and ones that she will have memory of forever, as will you the audience long after the film has finished. Great acting, great directing, great filming, great writing and a great story make this film well worthy of those Palmes D'Or. If there was a bright and happy side to life in Romania in the late eighties, you will not find it here. When she meets with Mr. Bebe (Vlad Ivanov), the illegal abortionist, he is perturbed that she came instead of Gabita and even more distressed that neither of the two hotels he suggested were booked. When the sleazy abortionist discovers that Gabita is not two months pregnant as she had said but 4 months, 3 weeks and 2 days, he ups the ante."
6498,"But as this excellent new documentary shows, things went wrong for reasons â€” because of how the war was planned and executed. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld comes across as a glib conductor of public relations as things descend into chaos and the viewer will be left with the impression he was not merely inept, but a blithering idiot."
6500,"In one of the best performances of his career, Tommy Lee Jones is Hank Deerfield, a career military man whose son Mike (Jonathan Tucker) is reported as AWOL from his New Mexico base after returning from eighteen months in Iraq. While director Paul Haggis gets uniformly good performances out of all the characters, the movie belongs to Tommy Lee Jones as the grieving father and Charlize Theron as the determined detective. Charlize Theron does a wonderful job as the detective, and despite her small screen time Susan Surandon plays the grieving wife of Jones to perfection. Instead of going for simple emotional tugs that he did with "" Crash, "" this film focuses on its understated performances, namely from Tommy Lee Jones, who is superb in this film. Paul Haggis has an uncanny way of bringing out great performances from all of his actors."
6501,"Other notable fine performances are give by the one and only Tracey Ullman as Mother Nature, and Saoirse Ronan as Pfeiffer's daughter. Judging from the reaction, laughter and applause of the hundreds of others in attendance, this movie is a winner. Given that they live and work in Hollywood, a city where human relationships are based on appearance and people take extraordinary good care of themselves, it seems strange that somebody like Michelle Pfeiffer could be so insecure about her looks. Jon Lovitz appears in the film also and adds a great comedic experience to the film. Her daughter is played by Saoirse Ronan, a talented young woman who is gonna be breaking out in a big way in the next year with this and roles in several other really big - name films."
6502,"It was a wonderful story of growing up and as the memories are long distant everything seems so much more magical and larger than life. While there is only a small cast, each one has a strong role and Mr & Mrs McAnsh are truly memorable. Kangaroo Island is absolutely stunning and from the dusty outback to the crystal clear coast, the visual splendour is a feast for the eyes. The emotional charge simply grows bigger and bigger from the beginning of the movie towards the end thus providing with a finale of biblical proportions (emotionally speaking). For many years, Daniel Radcliffe has stunned audiences both young and old alike as the dynamic Harry Potter."
6503,"That's due mainly to sterling performances from Gere, reinvigorates after The Hoax, and Howard, showing a comic side after the intensity of' Crash' Jesse Eisenberg also looks like this role was written for him personally, and the remaining cast are appropriate."
6504,"After you shake off its terrific immediate impact (there is no way to think while watching it), you realize that "" Eastern Promises "" is also a kind of morality tale, complex and important. A lot has been said about acting and it is true Mortinssen really delivers. "" Eastern Promises "" will take your breath away, churn your stomach, and then leave you with memories of unforgettable characters as well as perplexing thoughts about good and evil. Eastern Promises is a really good film with and extraordinary Viggo Mortensen at its very core. Although Eastern Promises has some of the director's signature moments of eye - popping violence, they do not dominate this film and it is the quiet moments - where the characters are silently contemplating aspects of their own existence that give the film its power."
6508,"There are some great scenes here and some pretty fun kills, not a whole lot that you haven't seen before, but still entertaining. P. s. why did they keep airbrushing Milla's face, she is entirely too beautiful for that. In all honestly, all three movies disgrace the name of Resident Evil. If you are going to see this movie because you are a hard core fan of the game since the mid nineties when resident evil first came out. The predecessors were horror movies with great action."
6509,"As romantic comedies go, "" Good Luck Chuck "" isn't bad. Cook and Alba do good jobs with a paper - thin script and add some great moments with the physical humor such as the flying dental tools and jump starting Dane Cook as seen in the trailer. There were a lot of gross - out moments that just weren't funny--the fat sidekick scrubbing his backflap with a scrub - brush for sexual pleasure, a penguin eating his crap, two seduction scenes with obese women (straight out of "" Norbit ""--also unfunny). If you want your next dose of laughter after Superbad then go see Good Luck Chuck but don't expect anything new or inventive in terms of storytelling. Sad to say there were only a few really memorable funny parts to the movie though."
6510,"Sean Penn is a talented somehow but choosing the right sorts of role models to present on film is not one of his skills. But Penn gets a terrific performance out of him as well as Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn, Wm. Hurt, Kirsten Stewart, jena Malone and everyone else for that matter. - even a bit of Ken Loach - Ruby in Paradise - Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore - Five Easy Pieces - Easy Rider. This film is a wonderful glimpse into the life of a kid, wise beyond his years, and the bonds that he creates with people along the way. At their best, all four together give some of the most emotionally charged moments in the film."
6511,"The story is about a selfish star quarterback who plays for the Boston Rebels NFL team. The supporting cast of football players was well done. The Rock proves that he is more than an action hero, he also can do comedy in a very good way, the little girl Madison Pettis is so cute and his acting is great, she looks very natural. The beginning cracks you up, you see this guy basically in love with himself trying to make it to the big one of his football career when he has a little girl thrust upon him. It has a very simple yet enjoyable story about a famous football player who's life is all about football, parties, women and his dog apparently a very good life but also a very lonely one when someday a girl appears at his door telling that he is her dad and there's where he must learn how to be a parent and at the same time to live."
6512,"The cinematography, costumes, scenery, etc. were all first rate. Bravo, Ang Lee, for bringing to the screen such a lustrous tale of Chinese history in which you have also thrown in love scenes which bring to the film an element of cruelty and harshness which are reminiscent of the sexual pleasures of BASIC INSTINCT, but perfectly display the brutal character of Mr. Yee. The costumes, sets, lighting and the drama of the story make LUST, CAUTION a simply elegant journey with characters that jump off the screen with fury, passion and of course, love tinged with revenge. The global combination achieved the great technical support besides the compelling story and the feast of performances. Because there were so few windows that allowed the audience to glimpse into his character, that made the emotions all the more realistic and powerful."
6513,"If you ever read Ian Fleming's work you'd know that the books and film stories are totally different but they manage to convey the ruthlessness, the style and epic quality of the books and add their own style of fun to generate the longest running successful sequels in history. The secret of success is in the way it creates magic not out of stereotyped wizards (a la Harry Potter), but out of the honest descriptions of the events that unfold for Will Stanton. So, to make a film that changes characters as significantly as this does, omitting some, radically altering others, changing the whole substance of Will's family is unforgivable. How is this for a financial idea: Susan Cooper wrote a 5 book masterpiece that works for kids and adults alike. The interweaving of Arthurian legend with local Chiltern folk - lore does not need special effects and the story itself is perfect for a film without plot changes."
6514,"Stiller, Akerman, and Monaghan did put their heart into their commendable comedic performances. Also, some other praiseworthy acting broke into "" The Heartbreak Kid "" in the form of: Jerry Stiller playing Eddie's dad Doc, Rob Corddry playing Eddie's follicle challenged best friend Mac, and Danny McBride playing Miranda's overprotective redneck cousin Martin. But perhaps the most memorable and highly rated laughfest will be his starring in the Farrelly Brothers' There's Something About Mary, with Matt Dillon and Cameron Diaz as the ditzy blonde the two guys are trying to go after. If you are a fan of There's Something About Mary, there will be plenty to laugh about, but none of the content is rich or deep; most of the funniest scenes happens to be gross - out and shock humor. Also many, many great performances by actors in supporting roles."
6515,"The most satisfying element about "" Dan in Real Life "" is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) makes sense and is beautifully realistic. Another wonderful aspect about "" Dan in Real Life "" is that it is a perfect film for adults who are interested in a mature comedy that leaves out the three pillars of the "" frat pack "" formula: dumb chicks, chauvinistic guys, and sleazy jokes. "" Dan in Real Life "" is witty and has fun, intelligent laughs throughout. Whereas other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience into laughing, the jokes from "" Dan in Real Life "" are more natural and clever, and involve some thinking on the part of the audience. All in all, "" Dan in Real Life "" is a great film, a fantastic escape from the redundancy of offensive and dumbed - down comedies."
6516,"There is so much humor in watching three brothers stoned on Indian pharmaceuticals, trying to pray and getting sidetracked by arguments over stolen belts and confided secrets. A stroll through various imaginative carts, occupied by compartments of colorful characters and incidents. Wes is further interweaving his "" dollhouse "" aesthetic with the real world. He's trying to push the medium forward in terms of tone. On this journey through India, these three brothers attempt to also attain some spirituality by undergoing ridiculous made up spiritual rituals."
6517,"And it has a couple of great action scenes. The Grusinsky family is a family of cops, father Bert is Deputy Chief and son Joe is Captain. There are several really well done scenes that are unbearably tragic and tense (the shoot - out between cars is particularly good) but mostly the film takes a slower pace that focuses on the characters. The film creates a handful of true white - knuckle scenes but also accomplishes telling a story that has weight and depth. Gray creates real mood in several particularly excellent scenes."
6518,"It is dazzling and Blanchett can't be denied, but "" Elizabeth: The Golden Age "" is like a chick - flick with explosions plus costumes, super hair, and loud, intrusive music. Cate Blanchett and the entire cast are good actors & do not disappoint in their character portrayals. This is the case for "" The Golden Age "", the sequel to "" Elizabeth "", a film that turned Cate Blanchett into a star, introducing her considerable talents to the masses. "" The Golden Age "" is a very handsome film, with superb production, and some spectacular costumes, exquisitely worn by Ms. Blanchett. Blanchett's Queen is youngish and attractive."
6519,"But the screenplay cleverly contrasts high - intensity scenes and well - developed characters. But as a suspense thriller, it's possibly the best one of the year or even in years. The only way she can breakthrough these odds is to make her bosses impressive. As many have said in their reviews, George Clooney gave his best performance to date."
6520,"There are moments of belly shaking humor and quiet tears as Ryan Gosling brilliantly evolves from a reclusive soul with the help of a silicone woman and a kind hearted community. The film draws you in, changes your initial beliefs and provides a wonderful message at the same time. Ryan Gosling provides a spectacular tour - de-force as a dysfunctional young man in a small town who only begins to blossom when he starts a "" relationship "" with an expensive love doll. Strong support is provided by the always - refreshing Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson, and by Kelli Garner as the sweet thing who becomes "" Bianca's "" rival. He's given two of the best performances in the last two years: here in "" Lars "" and last year in "" Half Nelson . """
6521,"A few years pass and here's yet another vampire story. The graphic novel, 30 Days of Night, put together by the talented team that worked on Todd McFarlane's stunning "" Hellspawn "" series, Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith found a way to do something creative within the vampire realm, and its completely to do with premise. It is what it is; an extremely gory movie about vampires killing people and it's thrilling, entertaining and put together very well. The vampires were made very good, they really looked scary! A new cinematic creature, 30 Days of Night's antagonists are ultra scary with their deformed appearances and their mercilessly gut - wrenching killing sprees."
6522,"It is a film about people and that is what lifts this film above so many others. All the performances in the film are superb. All of them gave engaging performances as well. After a decade of critically disgraced performances and brutal public humiliation year after year, Ben Affleck took a well deserved break from the Hollywood scene. A conversation with Bressant soon after this act provides a stage for Ed Harris' remarkable display of talent in one of his career best performances."
6523,"By turns genuinely engaging and laugh out loud funny, Weirdsville is daft but brilliant. Allan Moyle, the director of 1990's Pump Up the Volume, directs another tale of disaffected youth featuring a pair of junkies as an entertaining double act, Royce and Dexter (Wes Bentley and Scott Speedman). Scott Speedman and Wes Bentley build a real chemistry that grows on you and it's really good to see Bentley in a role that is FINALLY likable. Someone mentioned that the film was being touted as Trainspotting shot in Canada with laughs. But Moyle adds enough of his own visual exuberance to defy unflattering comparisons and his hallucinogenic effects lend extra scope to the irreverent caper humour."
6524,"Oscar worthy performances from Affleck, Pitt, and Rockwell - Oscar worthy cinematography - Oscar worthy directing. Clearly defined, flickering light sources and deep black shadows create a dazzling, nightmarish vision that haunts the rest of the film. In the films most horrific scenes, the music turns them into something beautiful. Paul Schneider, Jeremy Renner and Garret Dillahunt all turn in exceptional performances and enhance a cast of big name stars. Visually, the film soars beyond anything that has hit the screen since Conrad Hall's final masterpiece with Road to Perdition."
6525,"Very shy and hesitant â€“ she agrees to the work of masturbating men for a decent sum of Pounds 900 per week. Her hesitations, her doubts, her fears, her joy, her confidence, her love, and her grandiose â€“ everything is perfect. She speaks more in her silences, stares and glances than with words. A special mention of veteran actor Miki Manojlovic â€“ who has played the dark character of Mikky with so much punch and humanness that it is remarkable and not easy to forget. Both Marianne and Miki sparkles the screen with their historic."
6526,"The black - and - white animation, highly stylized and two dimensions which doesn't attempt to render the usual cartoon 3 - D, summarizes in quick, intelligent flashes, often impressionistic, growing up in Teheran and Vienna from a highly personal point of view. The narrator, Marjane Satrapi, only daughter of an educated Teheran couple, first sketches in briefly how the Shah first came to power, only to lose it and have it replaced by the fanatical religious regime of today. That's the great achievement of the movie: to be true to the comics and therefor, to the life of Marjane. The best parts of it are all about her personal relations, with her grandmother or her uncle. Though the story simplifies things quite a lot, it has a good reason for doing so: everything is seen from the point of view of the main character who brings forth her memories as a little girl in Iran, as a teenager in exile and as a married woman back in Iran."
6527,"27 years after his tragic death, Curtis' incredible contribution to music is finally being recognized in Anton Corbijn's film, "" Control . "" The use of black and white also captures the factory town of Manchester, England in the late 1970s, a city crumbling under industrial and economic stress. At a chance meeting following a Sex Pistols concert, Curtis bonds with three fellow musicians to form the band. Singers such as Jim Morrison, Kurt Cobain and even the early years of Michael Stipe would often drift into the moment of the song. The intensity of the live music performances in the film are as visceral as those of the real band."
6528,"The strength of this movie is that even if you have a tough time with that conceit, you will still enjoy the humor of it, and the strong performances. How do you learn to tell true friends and quality persons from those who are perhaps flashy and amusing, but will end up betraying your friendship and trust or, heaven forfend, tempting you to abandon your own principles? In truth, he has eyes for Jocelyn and, although a science fiction fan, would read almost anything to get to know her better. There are several attractive females, some lesbian domestic affection scenes handled with remarkable matter - of - factness, and the film (and novel) handles the male characters gently and with love."
6529,"Here, in Bulgaria, the audience laughed and applauded when the German granma said with all her conviction to the Kurdish girl that everything in her country will become alright once they join the EU. On the other hand, an Ã©migrÃ© Kurdish audience will probably applaud a very moving and full of suspense depiction of the Kurdish struggle in Turkey, which is however frank both to Kurds and to the Turkish authorities. Faith Akin knows how to tell this story in a way that is both heartbreaking and uplifting. Faith Akin, renowned for his energetic movie' Gegen die Wand', brings another story about the Turkish - German community. In a beautiful way Akin shows the struggle of a Turkish prostitute, a professor of German literature, a young Turkish rebel, a student English and Spanish and a retired widower to find peace and happiness in their lives."
6530,"It was funny and insightful, showing the ups and downs of marriage and also showing unconditional Love that has to come with a successful marriage. The comedic, yet dramatic, performances by the actors was quite impressive. Instead of showing African Americans as either crack heads or criminals he is trying to show that African American people hold important jobs, are educated and struggle with issues just like white people do. Despite some of these often repeated mistakes (not just here but in other movies) this movie was very very good. It is a comedy - drama HUMAN interest film about four married couples who vacation together once a year to reaffirm their marriages."
6554,"It's interesting, as most of the time the filming style is bright and clear, rather than dark or "" tripped out "" like so many other drug movies. There are elements of great artistic direction--which is often neglected in many pot related movies, and their are numerous political metaphors. The thought process was incredibly accurate, the physical effects, everything."
6531,"Who would've thought that a slasher horror film franchise, after three sequels, could STILL be one of the best things Hollywood has to boast today? Darren Lynn Bousman's exquisite directing incorporates a dire sense of urgency throughout the whole film, making it feel like you're watching a "" 24 "" episode. "" Saw IV "", from director Darren Lynn Bousman ("" Saw II "" and "" III ""), and writers Patrick Melton, Marcus Dunstan and Thomas Fenton (taking over for series veteran Leigh Whannell) delivers a story that is thrilling, poignant and disturbing, taking the series in a slightly different direction in terms of tone and style, while at the same time retaining the mood that made the first three films unique. While the film might not have the "" ouch "" factor that past traps (paticularly "" The Rack "" from "" III "") might have had, they are certainly gory and zany enough to keep everyone entertained and revolted at the same time. Hopefully it'll have more extra footage than the others."
6534,"The story of what the family went through as the result of the hatchet job by 60 Minutes ultimately makes the film a far more interesting one than it would have been otherwise. Excellent, absorbing documentary about a 4 year old whose abstract paintings sell for tens of thousands of dollars, The film starts as a portrait of a prodigy, but as the film - maker admits via narration, as the filming went along, and especially after a "" 60 Minutes "" piece aired that made it look like the girl was getting help from her father, the focus of the film switched to new, and much more interesting (and troubling) questions. Her pieces were being sold for big bucks with much bigger profits on the way. he does appear shifty and one has to believe that he is certainly capable of doing the enhancements. The camera work and lighting could be better in some places, but altogether it's a worthwhile watch."
6535,"As funny and winsome as it is poignant, MaCh is one of the few films about an unconventional family life that doesn't pile on eccentricity for eccentricity's own sake, showing that it's possible to build a happy life and learn to love others despite the personal flaws and developmental / emotional issues of everyone involved. Now that Cusack's longtime bud and co-star Jeremy Piven has a steady gig with TV's ENTOURAGE, has Platt become Cusack's new Piven? "" Although MaCh takes time to have fun even when things get serious (loved David and Dennis's Martian walk / dance to the Guster song "" Satellite "") and is generally upbeat, with quite a bit of gentle humor, it doesn't shy away from showing the difficulties of adopting an emotionally scarred child, with the frustration and sadness inherent in such a situation. Martian Child balances out product driven entertainment with straight, direct to the soul, honest entertainment. It's aimed at the heart, and touches the emotions."
6537,"This movie is, in more than one ways, a tribute to the amazing American movie era of the seventies and a recognition of the situation of American black people in the same period when they were strong enough to fight for their rights but still had no place in the movies to make their point. Long continuous shots (sometimes filmed with a hand - held camera) are alternated with montages giving the movie a lot of spunk; the overall editing is very good. Cuba Gooding Jr. could have gotten a bigger part, or more scenes because he's a very talented actor and he proved himself many times that he's more than capable of delivering excellent performances. Without giving away more, it and the following scenes lead to some surprising moral and character statements by Scott. Everything is very well balanced, the movie may seem baffling at times but nothing is left to chance and every shot in this long movie has a point to make."
6574,"A very refreshing return to the realms and themes that Tim Burton is so very amazing at capturing. Sweeney Todd as he admires one of his efficient razors after a long absence. Throughout the musical, Steven Sondheim's lyrics expressively revel in the amoral, throat - slicing world that Sweeney and his adoring meatpie lady, Nellie Lovett (Helena Bonham - Carter), wallow in as he prepares to take revenge on the equally amoral Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman), who dispatched Todd to prison early on to get his beautiful young wife. Sweeney's lyric best expresses the wildly murderous world, hardly the usual province of musicals: "" Alright! Despite the grim expectations from the story synopsis, the film delivers gore in a surprisingly tasteful way."
6538,"Some of the bee hive interior and flight scenes were just breathtaking. The connection of a talking bee with a human girlfriend was too ludicrous to be entertaining, as were the courtroom scenes. A clever script and comic timing that only Jerry Seinfeld has mastered, this film is sure to take you on a journey. Although his natural instinct is to beeware of humans, his life takes a turn for the better when he meets a saintly florist who not only beefriends him, but helps him quickly file a lawsuit beefore humans can take all the credit for mass production of honey! Jerry Seinfeld has a wonderful story to tell, but the kids would definitely not be interested."
6539,"He has somehow managed to make a film that bears all the hallmarks of his classics while intertwining some more modern elements (graphic sexuality, violence, and playing with time - frames and POV's) into a crackling, vibrant, lean, mean, and provocative melodrama. Lumet is a master at directing people walking through spaces to create tension and develop characters. The coherent and classical presentation he uses makes the similarly structured films of wunderkinds Christopher Nolan and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu seem like amateur hour. Of course, what Lumet is best at is directing amazing ensemble casts and tricking them into acting within an inch of their lives. Lumet runs them through the gamut of emotions that culminate in a scene that is the best of its kind since William Holden taunted Beatrice Straight right into a Best Supporting Actress Oscar in "" Network . """
6540,"Mathieu Amalric was unusually charming as Jean - Dominique Bauby, and Max Von Sydow was heartbreaking as his lonely widower father. The female leads were all equally impressive as they were beautiful. THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY is a jewel of a French film with a story that impacts an audience with an appreciation for life (the butterfly) and for the despair of what may happen if a tragedy might befall you (the diving bell) with the beautiful landscapes of France as a backdrop. The lighting and photography enhance the film, and the faces of the French women are wondrous to behold as the story unfolds on the screen. This film deserves all the accolades that it has received in a story which is spellbinding and emotional."
6541,"If you are looking for a Donnie Darko, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind MUST SEE A SECOND OR THIRD TIME TO FULLY UNDERSTAND kind of movie then go for it! Beautifully shot, as you would expect, and with some (welcome) moments of humour amongst the gore, this is a very very fine film. Shot through with moments of humour these come, as in life, from real situations and observations so don't be fooled into thinking this will be the serious film with goofy - characters Coens of Fargo. Javier Bardem gives the best performance of his career. No matter how you feel about immigration, you may find this association of Mexicans with a rising tide of evil to be offensive."
6543,"If you have a low opinion of lawyers, you'll really appreciate this story! Everyone else that follows - Burt and Linda's friends and associates - are almost as riveting. Given the extensive media coverage given to the Burt / Linda Pugach story during his crime, two trials and their shocking marriage, all of which the filmmakers could draw from, it's amazing how seamlessly and effortlessly this work of art appears to have been crafted. The bizarre story of Burt and Linda has so many twists and turns that your attention is constantly focused on it; but the superb editing and masterful use of sources are so adroitly done that you're barely aware of how carefully this film was constructed. Entertaining and mildly provoking film documents the weird highs and strange lows associated with a decades - long bizarre courtship of one Linda Pugach by her mildly insane husband Burt."
6544,"A trio of beautiful performances form the heart of this film, although the secondary characters are also crisply compelling. There are some exceptional musical performances, especially from relative newcomers, Jamia Simone Nash who sings up a storm and Leon Thomas who croons and plays guitar. But the most impressive thing about this movie is that all of the actors really played these instruments themselves. Apparently, both Freddie Highmore, keri russell, Jonathan Rhys Meyers learned most of the songs and played / sang them themselves, which is very impressive once you see the movie. John from five for fighting wrote a few songs on the soundtrack as well."
6546,"Excellent ensemble performances created believably real characters, each with his or her own fallibilities, personal credo, and enthusiasms. For anyone who has an intellect, is open minded and ready for an adventure born of thought, Ideas and possibilities, make absolutely certain you do not miss this film. All though it did not cost tens of millions to put to film, it is a winner in any category. This is a movie to provoke deep thought and conversation and that dares to challenge mainstream beliefs."
6547,"Significant and entertaining, thought - provoking and reality - based sad, mostly well - written, and exceptionally well - acted, "" Lions for Lambs "" is likely to leave the audience with the feeling of having participated in an important happening, but perhaps not quite knowing what it was. Quite honestly, as culture gets more and more "" dumbed down "" and bubble gum like so do the so - called thought provoking movies. To summarise briefly, the movie consists of essentially 3 scenes; a senator's office in DC (representing the establishment), a college professor's office in California (representing the liberal element) and a mountain top in Afghanistan (representing active engagement). Lions for Lambs is a current issue film that deals with several relevant topics. Redford's section is, at least, an effective call - out to the collegiate generation to stand up and get involved with the future of America, but the scenes involving the two soldiers (played with minimal exertion by Derek Luke and Michael Pena) serve only to put an emotional face on the political conflicts of the film."
6548,"Pretty much everyone knows the story of Beowulf - man fights monster, monster's mum and then a dragon - but this ancient story has inspired generations of writers and academics, now it gets a shiny makeover courtesy of Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary. But let's be honest, everyone watches a movie about Vikings for the action. The impression of living, breathing flesh is almost complete with the exception of strangely dead eyes - this movie is a landmark in computer imagery. So, its a violent special effects triumph - could anything be wrong? Oh dear god in heaven above what were they thinking - this is a treasure house of appalling voices, Irish (ish), Scottish (ish), Welsh (ish) are all thrown into the mix, but the standout horrors are Jon Malkovich's take on Danish which might have been inspired by the Muppets and Angelina Jolie dusting off her accent from' Alexander'."
6549,"It has a wonderful sense of magic about it and very good solid performances from the leads. Some of the most moving moments in the film were created by little more than the expression on his face. The story follows a small cast characters and how their lives come together and change each other for the better. Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium is a delightful and gentle movie for a family outing. The chemistry between the cast is engaging, so much so that all the "" walk on "" roles seem to interrupt the more important moments for the principal actors."
6552,"Much more interesting was the story from the people actually in Darfur and also Ocampo in his attempts to bring those responsible to justice, but also this part of the story is skimmed over. This film aims to bring you close to whats going on, and on many levels it succeeds. The celebrities and the Western players in this movie get all the pathos and are presented in detail, such as the aid worker calling home to his family, Don playing with his kids etc. ."
6553,"Not just a horror movie that gets laughs from the horror gags. For those of you who like dark comedy, horror movies and action, and want something new and refreshing, watch Murder Party. This award - winning movie is 90 minutes well - spent. There's many surprises & laugh out loud moments. The rest of the characters were all hilarious in their competitive pursuit for the grant money and all the performances were note perfect."
6555,"You can have the most unbelievable, and maybe even the most ludicrous, situations and events, but if you make the characters believable and further peel the layers to expose fear, prejudices and vulnerability then you have the foundations towards making an effective film. Masterfully written screenplay (from the original short story by Stephen King) and masterfully directed, anyone who is generally sceptical about adaptations of Stephen King "" horrors "" will be rewarded by watching this, Frank Darabont has done a typically marvelous job (see Shawshank and Green Mile) and well and truly delivered. Most of his horror movies are in the 4 - 6 range with classics such as The Shawshank Redemption, The Shining, and The Green Mile ranking 8 - 10 (although two of those aren't technically horror movies). Darabont has added some elements not found in the King story, but each one of them is spot on. Frank Darabont's adaptation of Stephen King's novella goes heads above a 50s / 60s monster movie homage."
6556,"The movie is quite simply, the best Family movie in the past few years. The cast led by Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, James Marsden and Timothy Spall (Wormtail from the Harry Potter movies who gives an inspired Oscar - worthy performance) is impeccable. Rounding out the cast is Susan Sarandon who is part Evil Queen, part Maleficent and pure EVIL and the adorable Rachel Covey who is the perfect "" mini-princess "" for Giselle to play off of. The original songs are the best to come out of Disney since The Hunchback of Notre Dame. While awaiting to be rescued by her Prince Edward, Giselle bonds with father and daughter, with him teaching her a thing or two about dating, and her teaching him on the positive aspects of love."
6557,"It's very easy to follow, the acting can be downright terrible at times (but very solid from Olyphant who was a GREAT choice to play Agent 47), the special FX are loud and neat to look at, there's lots of explosive action - packed gun fights, and the hot chick gets naked. You want to go have a fun time at the movies with your friends? Alright, this movie might have 2 different ratings whether you're seeing this because you're a fan of the game or if you're a casual viewer of action movies. When his employer sets him up in a political assassination attempt, the hit - man must uncover the leaders behind the conspiracy while simultaneously protecting a sassy prostitute and being hunted by both the Russian Secret Police and two determined Interpol agents. Though Timothy Olyphant is likely not the first actor to enter one's mind on hearing of a Hit - man movie, he accomplishes the surprising feat of impressing upon the audience that he is indeed Agent 47."
6558,"When Clay finds a donor compatible with his rare blood, he requests his friend Dr. Jack Harper (Terrence Howard) to operate him under the protest of his mother that wants the famous Dr. Jonathan Neyer (Arliss Howard) responsible for the procedure. "" Awake' has a simple but effective story about a wealthy young man that needs to be submitted to heart transplantation and experiences an anesthetic awareness discovering that things are not like he believes they are. Very good story, excellent crime movie plot, unexpected turnings: this film has all that a film needs in order to be entertaining. And what a great ending to make you feel you so got your moneys worth. Christensen proves that he was victim of the script writing in the "" Star Wars Episode "" movies."
6559,"Somehow in the fantasy realm, studios have seen giant dollar signs over the heads of young children and grasped for material with a previously established audience that appeals to this demographic. Such an enhanced cut would fill in a lot of the details of this world, more fully develop the scenes and characters, and truly give a feeling of being part of the adventure, instead of just watching it. Kids will be wowed by the elaborate set designs and CGI effects, which are far superior to the ones in the similarly clunky but still entertaining "" Chronicles of Narnia "" and culminate in an awesome battle sequence involving armored polar bears--take that Global Warming! The polar bears have a cartoony unreal feel but in a fantasy setting with battle armour and stuff they work well enough. One day Lyra hears hushed talk of an extraordinary particle which is rumoured to possess profound properties that could unite whole universes."
6560,Neville was an ordinary guy who was caught up in extraordinary circumstances.
6561,"The chipmunks become a big hit and superstars with cute voices and fancy dance moves. It was good to hear the Chipmunks sing their classic Christmas song, there were plenty of funny (but not hilarious) moments, and the Chipmunks themselves were well - animated and undeniably adorable (particularly Theodore). Where Alvin and the Chimpmunks succeeds where movies such as Garfield and Scooby Doo have failed is the fact it succeeds in the comedy department. But its when the three start singing the movie just comes to life, the Chimpunks Christmas song definitely gave the older members of the audience to relish in, and their rendition of Funky Town is by far the highlight of the movie. The script itself is pretty decent, there are the obligatory clunky sentimental bits, but generally the movie is consistent and full of laughs."
6562,"Futurama fans rejoice and be happy that Futurama is going to be back on the air, but the celebration begins with their first direct - to - DVD movie Bender's Big Score. This is easily the most in depth Futurama story to date. Speaking of pleasing all fans, you have almost every character you've met in the Futurama Universe saying Hi. It was pretty much nonstop Futurama silliness from the get go. One example, Zoidberg gets hostile with Leela because she talks down about a dumpster."
6563,"It's worth seeing if you enjoy films about pathological relationships. It has some funny moments but it is DEFINITELY not a true comedy. Baumbach is also perhaps too brazen staging talks of a sexual nature between adults and children; this works extremely well when the subject matter is touched on by just the younger people, but Margot's relationship with her pubescent son (which Margot already accepts is too entwined) skirts uncomfortable parameters which may be more amusing if the characters on - screen laughed a little too (it's left too blasÃ©). Writer - director Noah Baumbach's style is almost unlike anyone else's in the movies right now; and, as both a writer and a director, he's amazingly compatible working both sides of his talent (his dialogue is the music while his direction--and the nimble editing--provides the rhythm). The script is really sharp with many subtle references and the performances are all very impressive."
6564,"Woody (the wonderful young Marcus Carl Franklin, an amazing a singer and actor) is a precocious rail - hopper with a guitar (labeled like the real Woody's, THIS MACHINE KILLS FASCISTS) and tall tales that start with his claim that he's Woody Guthrie. Jack (Christian Bale) is the Dylan who became a hit in Greenwich Village and went into the South and sang "" The Ballad of Hattie Carroll "" and other protest "" folk songs, "" â€” the high - profile "" political "" Dylan who spearheaded a movement and became famous with his brilliant early LP's. But Jack doesn't want to be typecast and "" betrays "" his adoring public and his lover and folksinging champion Alice (Julianne Moore), a Joan Baez stand - in seen in later "" interviews . "" If Jack represents the cast - off early style and Robbie represents Dylan's family life, Jude (Cate Blanchett) is Dylan the artist, quintessentially as seen in the mid-to-late Sixties when he toured England (an event notably chronicled by two Leacock - Pennebaker documentaries) â€” and shocked his audiences, some of whose members felt betrayed and shouted "" Judas! "" He's reborn symbolically in Pastor John (Christian Bale again), who's moved to Stockton twenty years later and become a born - again preacher, singing his own gospel songs."
6565,"It features three of the year's finest performances from Laura Linney, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Phillip Brosco, all of whom radiate on the screen as real, ordinary but complex, people. The three performances are all great for their own reasons. Linney plays a woman who is really confused with her life: she's having an affair with a married man who's ten years older than her, she lies to everyone she knows about things that aren't worth it, and she is having a lot of trouble getting produced as a writer. This guy has delivered THREE outstanding performances this year with "" The Savages "", "" Charlie Wilson's War "" and "" Before The Devil Knows You're Dead "". The rest of the cast does well under Ms. Jenkins' direction."
6566,"A reality TV show show called The Apocalypse sets up it's cameras in the same mutant - infested forest as the last film and the local residents quickly set about slicing and dicing the interlopers like an enraged Gordon Ramsey. A lot better than most other sequels in regards to similar movies like Jeepers Creepers 2, The Ring 2, The Grudge 2, Hills have eyes II, etc. ."
6567,"This is not a horror movie as such, this is one of those pictures that oozes old fashioned values as regards telling a grand old ghost story with mysterious undertones. The setting is perfect, the orphanage of the piece is a ghostly monolithic structure that has all those perfectly shadowy rooms that are hiding secrets, expansive gardens perfectly framed in aura by Bayona's willingness to let the setting be an integral part of the story. BelÃ©n Rueda plays Laura and it's a marvellous performance from her, full of emotion and guts, she carries the film with skillful ease. A smashingly engaging film that is in the vein of Robert Wise's The Haunting & Alejandro AmenÃ¡bar's The Others, so if you like real well told ghost stories that unhinge rather than shock you, get in the queue because El Orfanato is a real pleasure. SimÃ³n is HIV positive and tells Laura that he has five invisible friends, and she believes they are fruit of his imagination."
6568,"This is basically a cutesy film about being pregnant at 16, where despite a few problems, everyone gets to live pretty much happily ever after. During a funky, kick azz opening title sequence, Juno is on her way to the pharmacy. Juno MacGuff (played magnificently by TIFF regular Ellen Page), finds herself pregnant, knocked up by her best friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera) on their first attempt at sex. J. K. Simmons and Allison Janney did a nice turn as Juno's parents. Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman were great as the adoptive parents who, while seemingly the perfect suburban couple on the outside, have their own sets of issues on the inside."
6569,"Helvetica screened this week at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX where it was very well - received. This is the groundwork and it is well built on by the selection and use of a very good collection of designers and experts in the field â€“ almost all of whom are passionate, well spoken, interesting and, most importantly, not "" up themselves "" or self - important in the way that some of those in design or art can be. Graphic designers express both their love and hatred for the typeface as well as its effects on the larger world of design, becoming more of a film about modernism and post-modernism as it applies to this world. The movie is is definitely directed towards graphic designers, and found it very inspiring to go into the graphic "" business "" Overall, this was an excellent movie! It is shot well and the interviews seem to give a balanced opinion on the use of the typeface, but as a film, it is stretched thin, feeling overlong at its lean 80 minutes."
6570,"The emotional parts are done just right, but the funny scenes are the best. Good stuff for a movie that all ages can enjoy. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman did a superb job, playing two dying old guys who befriend each other, and together have the adventure of their lives. So while the story line surprises are few, sit back and enjoy excellent acting (including Sean Hayes), wonderful direction and a few life lessons. After they both find out that they each have only a few months to live, they agree to travel together all over the globe, and follow this list of tasks."
6571,"But the way Mr. Forster handled the delicate subject was touching and really, deeply moving. The acting, by non-professionals as well as professional actors, is excellent and the casting is magnificent. With a roller coaster of emotions you totally connect with the characters. Shaun Toub was great, it was a complete departure from his usual roles, and his acting for those who understand Persian / Dari was incredible. One thing to notes it that Khaled Hosseini actually loved the film which is unusual for book adaptation movies."
6572,"That is until everything comes to a grinding halt when, on an outing with his wife (Maria Bello) they find themselves hijacked by Tom Ryan (Pierce Brosnan), a mysterious stranger who tells them his associate has their daughter captive and unless they wish to see her alive again, they must complete a series of arduous and cryptic challenges. When their happy lifestyle is suddenly interrupted and turned upside down by the forceful intrusion of a menacing kidnapper (Brosnan), Abby and Neil (Bello and Butler) are left with no choice but to follow the increasingly difficult demands and tests set them by this man. It's taut, suspenseful, edge of your seat storytelling combined with good solid performances by all, especially Bello and Brosnan. Where you might expect a really intense, gritty score, this one opts for a quieter one with a hint of bluesy undertones and it works. It has its feet on the ground and its eyes on what's human and real."
6575,"National Treasure: Book of Secrets will always be known as the film that prevented Helen Mirren from meeting Queen Elizabeth after the success of The Queen. What goes wrong here is the whole mentality that sequels need to be bigger and better. Diane Kruger looks gorgeous as usual, but her role is more female in distress than really adding anything necessary to finding the treasure, unless you count watering rocks. With some great laughs and some really fascinating connections from history, you may actually learn something on the journey. But it provides a convenient segue to a sequel around page 47 of the book of secrets."
6576,"Lewis gives what is easily, EASILY the best performance of the past five years. Here, perfectly in his element and at his best, Lewis could go toe to toe with Brando and Kinski, playing a part that oozes enough skill and pathos to earn him a place among Hollywood's, and perhaps the world's, greatest performances of all time. The young man who plays H. W. Plainview was also very solid. As PTA stated during the Q&A last night, he seemed to know everything about the story and his character and seemed to be a natural. These are some of the movie's best scenes, with Plainview - and H. W. in tow - visiting backwoods bergs and convincing a gullible populace into signing away land rights for a fraction of what they were worth."
6577,"Philip Seymour Hoffman as usual is scintillating and brilliant - here playing a damaged but ultra-smart CIA manipulator, and it is in the exchanges between Hanks and Hoffman's characters where the comedy soars. This film deserves to be seen and to be recognized for finding an extraordinary balance between the darkest of dark subject matter and the lightness of touch of it's sparkling witty script - even if it does flunk the obvious link between the help that Herring and Wilson provide and the ultimate consequences (9/11). And no U. S. soldiers put their lives on the line - so it's a fun war. But even the most rakish rapscallion has a conscience lurking somewhere underneath, and for Charlie Wilson the unimaginable atrocities being committed in Afghanistan moved him to muster his entire political savvy toward funding the utter, humiliating defeat of the Russian military and, possibly, to even help hasten the end of the Cold War as a result. Under the skillful direction of Mike Nichols and a smart, snappy screenplay by Adam Sorkin, CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR is a sparkling, sophisticated satire that chronicles the behind - the - scene machinations of three colorful characters comprising "" Charlie's Team . """
6578,"They butted heads awhile and came up with a truly award - winning screenplay equipped with clichÃ© characters, idiotic decisions an gaping plot holes. After that, that crap-fest finally gets to the point where the Predator starts attacking the Aliens, or at least pretends doing so. Not exactly sure where to go next, seeing as they thought Anderson was the best director for the franchise and they had produced a true sci - fi gem, Fox turned to it's small, but knowledgeable group of monkeys for answers. If this was to be on Earth, in Colorado of all places, they needed to make it realistic. The list of questions just kept growing but the monkeys ignored them and finished their masterpiece."
6579,"It was definitely one of those movies where you're recalling a lot of funny parts a day later. It was a truly hilarious movie, including the scenes where the band members convince him to try the drugs, a scene with the Beatles, the variety show stuff and interviews, all the scenes with the title character smashing the sinks, and the Walk the Line spoofs. Like Airplane, there are a lot of times when you just don't see the next line coming, and those are the best laughs. All in all, Walk Hard is a really solid comedy and a must see for any Apatow fans. Songs in the credits are just as funny as songs through the body of the movie, so make sure to wait around for those rather than switching off after the story itself fades to black."
6581,"It just happens to be inspirational and uplifting and all that good, boring stuff that cause your eyes to roll when that's how the critics describe it. In the end it's the tenacious performance by the beautiful Jurnee Smollett that holds the emotional premise of the film together. Denzel Whitaker as the innocent, curious James Jr. is wonderful in exposition of character and gives the best child performance of the year. Denzel Washington, Forest Whitaker, Nate Parker, Jurnee Smollett, Denzel Whitaker, and Kimberly Elise are all stunningly good 2) The cinematography is very well done and the score is beautifully and uplifting. You may have seen Jurnee Smollett earlier in her career when she was a "" cute kid "" and a promising actress."
6582,"It's a story of mental disorders and people falling in love in unlikely circumstances. Think of it as "" Mozart and the Whale "" but more painful and more true life problems and neuroses, but also more heartwarming. His wonderful portrayal of such an awful, yet complicated character, makes it all the more enjoyable to see him come around and finally warm up to someone. This is Justin Thoreaux's directorial debut and a wonderful one at that. This is a wonderful film with characters that touch the hearts of anyone who has ever known or been close to someone with a severe depression, anxiety disorder or real neurosis."
6583,"But when the water horse, he named Crusoe, has grown too big, he and a family friend put him in the Lochness Lake where he is spotted and is now known as the infamous Lochness Monster. While the egg grows into a likable, gigantic plesiosaur, a strange man, who might be a German spy, starts as caretaker of the boy's father's estate, and a gunnery unit takes over the estates grounds. This is a great movie for all ages. The acting is well - done by the entire the "" creature "" is cute and believable with enough "" awwwwwwww "" moments, but not too much to become redundant. For Kiwis watching it's fun spotting familiar faces in the supporting cast."
6584,"* Kudos to Kudrow who is freaking hilarious! Oh, and Gerry's singing is amazing too, as are all his witty remarks and comments. The shining happy moments are definitely the comedy relief Harry Connick Jr. brings. The supporting cast is wonderful (especially the hilarious Lisa Kudrow). Her ensuing adventures with best friends, Lisa Kudrow and Lisa Gershon are hilarious."
6587,"The last 20 minutes of the movie actually had some good action, and the final battle was great."
6588,"In an ocean of predictable movies, "" The Band's Visit "" is an island of bliss. And yet it all works so well: even if you have never heard Egyptian music, when the band finally plays (as the end - credits roll), you're guaranteed to groove on it. Kolirin is a writer and director of great economy. The characters of and relationships between the eight band members - in their powder blue, Sgt. Pepper - wannabe, uniforms are revealed through a word here, an expression there, and pretty soon, you really know them. The head of the band, Tewfig, is an officious, prissy, downcast, silent figure, and yet as the camera stays on him a great deal of the time, slowly you are getting used to him, and when he finally puts together a couple of full sentences, you may feel acceptance and even appreciation."
6589,"The best way to describe this pile is to piture you and your friends trying to remake' lord of the rings' in your backyard, because what you ended up with would be of similar quality. That being said, it had a few nice action bits and Michael Lillard was very funny (probably on purpose). Uwe Boll does it again, a cast of some of the best actors in one of the worst movies ever made. The opening scenes are amazingly clumsy, they just dump you randomly into the story with no preamble. Of course nothing can be compared to the lord of the rings but this one is just hilarious funny."
6590,"Everything works in this movie: The direction, the acting, the shooting, the story and the script - one commentators claimed that it was limited and one dimensional but it is quite on the contrary: the script was written very elegantly with quite a lot of subtelties and these would probably be missed by those who are used the usual wham bahm great Hollywood films. Demi Moore is spot - on in her portrayal as the brilliant, yet stepped - on lone female executive who sacrificed too much before she realized too late it was for naught. However, Quinn has pretty much hit the glass ceiling career-wise with the company, and when she discovers that she is about to be let go from the firm, she agrees to join forces with the night janitor (Michael Caine) in his plan to rob the vault of a thermos - full of uncut diamonds. "" Flawless "" is a good old - fashioned caper tale done with an abundance of wit, intelligence and style and just enough twists and turns in the plot to keep the audience on its toes throughout. Moore and Caine make a perfect team as the duo plotting the heist, while director Michael Radford generates enough suspense for a dozen average thrillers."
6592,"Samuel L. Jackson and Ed Harris did their job very well in the leading roles and Harlin's direction was also good. Directed by Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2: Die Harder, The Covenant, Mindhunters) made an stylish, interesting, sometimes very fascinating film. Harlin's latest film certain matured a lot, after making Hollywood movies they were always Hits or Misses. Scott Kaven's (Cabin Fever, the upcoming Paul W. S. Anderson's Death Race) cinematography are also good. The actors in the film gives good performances."
6595,"It establishes the worlds of Orthodox Judaism and Islam so pitch - perfectly that the movie is fascinating just on the level of observing the lives of others. What the two lead women in this film hope to do is embrace the first part of their identities, while rejecting the second part. They turn in two flawless performances, and prove themselves to be actresses to watch. Meanwhile the Arabs are all mellow high IQ tolerant understanding scholars. In reality these marriages are usually more stable and successful then the secular â€“ live together for a couple of years then maybe marry type."
6604,"The lasting impact of such materials however, can be influenced by how well writer - producers have done their homework on matters psychological. Teeth takes an underused legend (vagina dentata) and eats into the late night chick - flick gore-fest market with gusto and relish. Their females have vaginas lined with razor - sharp teeth."
6602,"The movie is full of emotions, it will make you smile, laugh, and cry. Nadine Labaki managed to balance these emotions very successfully throughout the movie. The beauty of all the characters combined with the oriental scents and the pot - pourri of the nicest feelings that drive the life of human beings could not be pictured in a nicest way! The camera was their friend, exploring their most intimate feelings, joys and pains, but very protective too. Protective of their privacy, of their feelings, and their sadness."
6603,"Julian Temple--who filmed the Clash at one of their earliest rehearsals--has assembled a truly impressive array of footage, including 8 mm family films from Joe's childhood and a performance from the 101ers, his pre-Clash R&B / pub - rock band. In addition to interviews with former lovers and friends of Strummer, the movie provides generous helpings of file footage and home movies, as well as clips from films like "" If He developed a love of rock music, listening to records by The Beatles and The Beach Boys, as well as American folk - singer Woody Guthrie (Strummer would even go by the name "" Woody "" for a few years, until changing his name to "" Joe Strummer "" a year and a half before the Clash was formed). There are interviews with Joe's squat - mates from the early 70s, Mick Jones and Topper Headon of the Clash, and numerous other people (musicians and other) who either worked with Joe or were influenced by him. Yet, in his final years, a much more tranquil and mellow Joe began to emerge, managing to make "" peace "" between the hippies and the punkers by establishing outdoor music fests - affectionately labeled "" Joe's Campfires "" - to help bridge the gap."
6608,"As in many of Loach's earlier films, It's a Free World has a strong feeling for those who live on the margins in a society that does not care and, uncharacteristically for Loach, is surprisingly even - handed, showing the viewpoint of both the victim and the victimizer. Though It's a Free World is far less impactful than some of the earlier Loach - Laverty collaborations, it is a strong film that does not pull its punches and did not deserve a one - day U. K. opening and a direct - to - DVD treatment. In her first feature film performance, Kierston Wareing shows great promise as the blonde, leather - jacketed, motorcycle - riding entrepreneur who is willing to deal with the sleazier aspects of the business. Lastly the film begins and ends with the dynamic performance of unknown Kierston Wareing."
6616,"The film is written, directed and narrated by Alex Gibney, son of a high - ranking naval officer who was an interrogator in World War II. A great American and a true patriot, Frank Gibney's final disappointment of what became of the great nation of the United States in the hands of a few liars is heart - wrenching. Every person in the world, especially every American, that cares about the true nature of freedom and the sanctity of the individual (the basic tenets on which America was built) should see this film. The photos of Americans mistreating Muslim prisoners at Abu Ghraib are good recruiting material for anti-US terrorists. An example: the popular jingoistic TV program "" 24, "" starring Kiefer Sutherland as a CIA agent who "" saves "" millions by torturing mad terrorists with ticking bombs in Times Square."
6621,"His most recent film Hidden took a genre film and flipped it about to deliver one of the most surprising and intellectually challenging thrillers of the decade. He may see it as an American story, but it worked better as a small Austrian film, set in anywheres - ville Europe. Ingman Bergman's purity couldn't have allow him to do a film like "" Funny Games "", Haneke made it, twice. "" Funny Games is considered, by some, to be Michael Heneke's most commercial film, isn't that funny? The performances are overall well - executed, especially by Naomi Watts, an actress who has proved that she will still take risks despite the fact that she has made it both in the art - house scene and in mainstream Hollywood."
6622,"The most powerful sequence is at war's end when the "" real "" concentration camp prisoners, dirty, bleeding, and skeletal, creep into the money makers barracks with guns, unable to believe they are prisoners. The Counterfeiters is a very enjoyable film, which isn't something that can be said for many World War II "" true stories "". He witnesses the horrors of camp life; fellow prisoners are beaten, shot, and starved, but Sally, determined to survive, looks out for himself and uses his skills as an artist to secure a more comfortable lifestyle during his incarceration. But as the Nazis' situation becomes increasingly desperate and Berger's efforts to block the making of a perfect dollar keep succeeding, Herzog himself is in trouble. â€¢ Pounds and Dollars: In Smolianoff's narrative, he is transferred to Sachsenhausen, after counterfeit British pound notes have been successfully produced, in order to work on the more difficult forgery of American dollars."
6626,"Following the cult Brazilian TV series "" City of Men "" (2002 - 2005), Acerola (Douglas Silva) and Laranjinha (Darlan Cunha), two orphaned, teenage street kids living in Morro da Sinuca (one of Rio's 800 + favelas), are now about to turn eighteen and face the issues of adulthood. Fatherhood--in a social milieu where most kids grow up fatherless--is the key theme here: Acerola is now a teen dad who has to take care of his baby boy when his teen wife moves to SÃ£o Paulo to work as a babysitter; and Laranjinha is on the search of the identity of his unknown father, only to discover he's alive and is an ex-convict on parole. And trafficker Nefasto suddenly changing sides in the gang war; and Acerola's one - chance - in - a-million spotting trafficker Fiel still alive, and the phony solution linking Acerola's and Laranjinha's fathers in the past, etc. . He adopts cinÃ©ma - vÃ©ritÃ© style (in the camera - work, dialog, performances), now de rigueur in films dealing with "" stark realities "". Douglas Silva (Acerola) relies on his intuitive acting and his big, expressive fish face."
6627,"Brett Morgen revisited the courtroom of the Chicago 7's 1968 trial as truthfully as possible, a lesson every film maker should take. Mr. Morgen paid full respect to the 7 revolutionaries (David Dellinger, Abbie Hoffman "" a sort of rock star "", William Kunstler, Jerry Rubin, Bobby Seale, and Leonard Weinglass) who went to jail for their "" thought crimes "". Maybe this film will give Eminem's work a new meaning:) who knows. Written and directed by Brett Morgan, the documentary "" Chicago 10 "" blends amazing archival footage with animated re-enactments of the trial â€“ based on actual court transcripts â€“ with A-list actors like Hank Azaria, Nick Nolte, Mark Ruffalo, Roy Scheider and Liev Schreiber providing the voices."
6628,"It is a thought provoking, well executed expose' on the manipulations of the masses by those with wealth and power. Zeitgeist offers a lot of (black) humor in many ways, f. ex in the form of ridiculous criticism, like most of films that try to really make a difference and fight the commonly accepted values. Some critics even seem to derive a weird kind of pleasure from neglecting things and praising their narrow views about the Zeitgeist being overly one sided. Here's a bit more of this "" lunatic "" "" mumble "" to lighten up the end (and to give some of you an excuse to keep your values): Concern, respect and self - awareness."
6629,"If you are ever feeling stressed or unable to cope with something in your life, just put on any of their albums, all are masterpieces. More a family than a business, Sigur RÃ³s takes great pride in their work and say that they may even take too much time honing everything to the point of perfection. The visuals that director Dean DeBlois has added to enhance the music are magical. To see how the band uses layers of projections and cloth curtains, hearkening to the elaborate cd artwork they hold each album in, helps to explain the detail and perfection really at work. The kites in the air, the juxtaposition of the rundown fishing wharf with black and white footage of the time it once bustled, the mountains shrouded in fog, the ice melting, and the water flowing (forwards and backwards) leave you without words as it all encompasses you into the world of their sound."
6632,"Ilmar Raag has done a great job by showing what is going on in schools nowadays. It is a real story about real people coming across real problems. A powerful movie and it has nothing in common with "" Elephant "" because this one has nearly everything a good movie must have."
6636,"Eugenio Derbez in particular, does an amazing job as the hardened sidekick who discovers his heart might still be open to caring. There are some good performances here, and the male actors do much better, as the young boy easily explores an amazing range of emotions. All around the acting is wonderful, particularly the young boy Carlitos, played by Adrian Alonso. Carlos escapes from the car in El Paso, meets up with some illegal workers who are arrested, leaving the hidden Carlitos with a reluctant companion Enrique (Eugenio Derbez) who is able to aid Carlitos (reluctantly!) It's a lot better than a lot of the American movies that have been coming out weekly."
6812,"It's a little bit of Shrek the Grinch. Dreamworks had this little gem up it's sleeve. Shrek 2 came along, kept a lot of the same formula, and again in turn was a very good film. So if you thought there weren't any more original holiday shows to be made, Shrek the Halls may slightly change your mind about that. This little 22 minute marvel accomplishes what Shrek the Third could not: it is consistently funny and works well on its own."
6642,"There are parts of this film where she TRULY kicks a lot of ass. Add to that a great twist that leads up to an ending that is one of the creepiest endings ever, a couple of very emotional moments that are tear jerking, a great musical score, haunting and gorgeous cinematography, and some brilliantly done gore, and you have one of the greatest French horror movies ever made. Like Irreversible, Sheitan, Ils and MalÃ©fique, "" Inside "" is yet another proof that the best horror these days are coming from Europe (France, Spain and Germany specially). One important thing about this film is that is very good at maintaining tension and suspense, something that very few gory movies do. armed police officers, because police is, naturally, incompetent."
6648,"When he returns he meets Tarek (Haaz Sleiman) and Zainab (Danai Jekesai Gurira), who have taken up unauthorized residence in his apartment. Tarek and Zainab teach Walter to live again, to come out of his shell and remind him how unfair life can be. Haaz Sleiman, who plays Tarek, is (damn foxy) full of life as Tarek. His esprit fills Tarek, the audience, the other characters and actors with such vitality. There are beautiful scenes sometimes drawn out to boredom."
6654,"The movie was made by the very talented Garth Jennings of the famed music video production team Hammer and Tongs known for their visionary music videos and previously Hitcherhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Without these usual sources of childhood entertainment Will finds other ways to pass the time, namely in drawing out his flourishing imagination that he scribbles and doodles all over the pages of his bible. An unlikely friendship begins between Will and Carter as they begin production on Carter's home movie masterpiece, Son of Rambow. The performances by all the children were exceptional, especially Carter who is the movie's sparkplug and provides comic relief frequently. As well as Didier the french exchange student who is a text book example of how absurd the whole new wave trends of the day were, his appearances are all wildly amusing."
6655,"More than OK, it might even be better, because it has the potential (since it is funny and entertaining as well as informative) to reach a wider audience and make more people aware of the entire medical marijuana issue, the existence of' dispensaries' in California and the conflict between state and federal laws. It's pretty enlightening to see the plight and struggle of medical marijuana activists and people who try to provide the service despite the attempts to foil them lead by the DEA. Secondly the kinds of questions such an idea could raise are intriguing and probably in someway useful, but the closest he ever really gets to any kind of research is a few short term memory tests. Morgan Spurlock was a very healthy person, so eating McDonald's nonstop would have drastic affects. He has' tests' done, interviews a bunch of other comedians and his stand - up routines all intertwined with the' experiment'."
6668,"This is the honest truth, "" Beta House "" makes the first few "" American Pie "" movies look like "" The Little Mermaid "". The film is also loaded with great movie references for those who keep their eyes open. Beta House shows more nudity then The Naked Mile, which is surprising considering the previous installments title."
6662,"Love his movies or not he is an honest filmmaker with a true sense of the surreal and the poetry that lurks in the strangest details. It makes for some beautiful moments. Putting the great, great Samantha Morton together with Herzog, Richard Strange, Leos Carax (Pola X), Anita Pallenberg, Diego Luna, and James Fox - matches any casting coup by John Waters. Thomas Carlyle, that great Scottish author of Heroes and Superheroes, champion of the value of role models, suggested that, "" A man lives by believing something . "" There is Diego Luna â€“ best known for his great performance in Y Tu MamÃ¡ TambiÃ©n â€“ who is a Michael Jackson impersonator and hangs out with other impersonators."
6666,"But something about it is compelling, like craning your neck to see what horrors can be spotted at the scene of a car crash. She exposes raw and powerful talent in this film, almost like she is actually going through the same agony and despair as Sylvia Likens really did, she is painfully convincing and yet again, she fails to disappoint. Here Page plays Likens as a sensitive, kind and considerate sixteen year old and when the world comes crashing down upon her, the suffering she endures is heartbreaking and convincingly rendered by Page. The opening courtroom scenes and disclaimer that "" actual transcripts "" were used make that clear. It leaves the viewer with continuous emotions towards the Likens girls, especially Sylvia."
6672,"What an amazing movie about love, family, and relationships. While there are some scenes that scream "" low budget, "" the end product as a whole was very rewarding. This one is currently making the festival rounds, and last night played at Los Angeles' Outfest, to an enthusiastic crowd. The story seems very simple, but Markowitz takes his very familiar coming - of - age premise and molds it into a very rich and rewarding experience for movie viewers. In a nutshell, the story is about Zach, a talented young artist struggling to balance the demands and responsibilities of his disintegrating family with his need to express himself as an individual and deal with his budding sexuality."
6673,""" Stayin' Alive "" is fantastic and during the performance for "" Golden Years "" one can't help but laugh to the point of tears for Stan Goldman. These moments also bring some of the most powerful songs including a stirring rendition of Coldplay's "" Fix You "" by returning ex-member Fred Knittle with his Johnny Cash - like baritone. Stephen Walker has captured the essence of the group, under the intelligent direction of Bob Cilman. What is unexpected is the melancholy feel throughout as some of the members fall into bad health situations (sadly two of its key singers pass away before their fated concert the film focuses on) but it is also with plenty of humor, insight of what it means to be elderly but not' old' and how in the autumn of one's life one can appreciate a new calling (i. e. many of the choir prefer classical music than the genre they are covering). They sing rock and roll songs with such surprising gusto and Ã©lan that even prison inmates stand up and cheer."
6678,"What was really cool is that Zack explained in his Q&A afterwords that the final poker table was played for real and whoever won the game, won the movie. The other actors hold their own in their respective roles all working to try and win a big tournament for 10 million dollars. So, it was very entertaining, it includes very good jokes, deep emotions, it shows relationships between each other and their attitude to game. Cross does a fine job letting the air out of those poker players who are so full of themselves. It's hard to be a poker fan in the world of movies."
6706,"China's Three Gorges Dam is considered by many experts to be a full - steam - ahead eco-disaster, but helmer Yung Chang's gorgeous meditation is more concerned with the project's collateral human damage: old farmers evicted, young people in servitude to Western tourists, all brought about by an endeavor whose collective weight may ultimately tilt the Earth's axis. The juxtaposition of the travelers and crew in an overly elegant setting against the farmer and his family and their humble home on the river was a perfect balance. The score is well suited to the different settings, especially near the end, as the family's home and land sink slowly but inexorably under the waters of the Yangtze. You're left imagining what the young girl from the family will be able to do with her life beyond sending her savings from the cruise ship home to enable her parents and family to eat. And this magnificent project, still underway, will produce a grand total of 2 to 3% of the country's energy needs at the expense of millions of displaced Chinese who are in the way of "" progress . """
6685,"With insane conversations, loads of sexual themes (especially homosexuality), some serious violence, and quite possibly the biggest penis ever in a movie, Ex-Drummer succeeds on all types of levels. Everything production wise, it does with really any faults. The brilliant thing about the movie is that it is a one on one translation of the writer Herman Brusselmans."
6692,"Few films wowed audiences at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival as much as John Crowley's "" Boy A. "" Scipted by Mark O'Rowe from a Jonathan Trigell novel, "" Boy A "" is a story - driven mystery which is carried on the shoulders of newcomer Andrew Garfield, in a tour de force performance that dominates the film from opening title to closing credits. Paddy Cunneen's score makes it clear that this is, at its heart, a tale of intrigue. His subtle and moving role as the child murderer released after a youth spent in institutions, captures both the wide - eyed innocence and the dark and guilty conscience that Jack carries with him. With his role as the eponymous' Boy A' â€“ now known as Jack - Andrew Garfield establishes himself as a star for the future (and as' Lions for Lambs' is likely to be released before' Boy A', he may already be by the time it comes out). Part of this is the subject matter, part the solid drama of the novel by Jonathan Trigell on which Mark O'Rowe based his brilliantly understated screenplay, part the sensitive direction by John Crowley, and in large part is the cast of remarkably fine actors who make this impossibly treacherous story credible."
6700,"In the end, the stories are full of both beginnings and endings for all of the characters. These stories vary in quality but even the weakest; the Roommates story, is involving and fun as long as you remember that while Gord is exaggerated, there ARE many guys like him around. Fresh, unique, relevant, and beautifully photographed and directed, "" Young People F-cking "" is unquestionably going to end up as one of the best films of 2008. These are characters that have had their emotions stomped on, who have genuinely real problems that just about anyone in the audience can relate to. They all work well off their partner (as none of the groups interact with any of the others), and you can see the honest and sincere emotions in their facial and body expressions (since there are many moments where dialogue is not expressed as much as facial emotion)."
6701,"It chronicles the amazing journey of "" Doc "" Paskowitz, his nine kids and his beautiful and understanding wife Juliette. As was the case with "" Doc, "" the kids became champion surfers and the family was profiled numerous times in magazine articles and television segments. What "" Doc "" was preaching years ago is now fact â€“ eating well, preserving the planet and loving one another is essential to survival. Definitely Surfwise compellingly did all of the above. A Stanford - educated doctor and observant Jew fed up with conventional life and passionate about surfing, he put two failed marriages and an ordinary medical practice behind him in 1956 and left Hawaii for Israel."
6707,"The film perfectly balances both gorgeous footage of the continent as well as fascinating interviews and anecdotes of the many researchers and workers of the McMurdo research station. There are many humorous moments, such as a scene in which visitors must go through a follow - the - leader type exercise before being allowed to venture out into the wild. In both cases, Herzog features striking footage and amusing interviews and narration. It is a beautiful look at a beautiful continent populated by a forklift driver with a PhD, a woman who once traveled to South America in a sewage pipe on the back of a truck, researchers who play electric guitars on top of research station to celebrate discovering three new species of aquatic life in one day, and many more. If you are looking for answers as to why a red worm lives in the anus of static sea life or the consistency of the milk of a baby seal, you have come to the right place."
6712,"This follow up to Wolf Creek was written long before the surprise Aussie hit, Rogue has the hallmarks of a first feature script, hitting all of the genre conventions without ever attaining any moments of originality. The movie starts off with some beautiful scenes of Australian outback, they are absolutely stunning. There's no denying McLean can shoot a beautiful movie, and some of the wonderful scenes of the Australian top - end are simply stunning. Small touches like the guy letting his loved ones ashes into the water and the photographer having a sly chow down on a hidden sandwich were really cool touches. If you loved Wolf Creek or Jaws you'll love this!"
6724,"Some people might think that The Tracey Fragments would benefit from a more explicit epic narrative. And the more emotional the protagonist gets, the more fragments appear. The Tracey Fragments is a must see film! The Tracey Fragments is well acted in that there is very little acting and a lot of re-acting. The Tracey Fragments is a wonderful movie which everyone should all see for the experience."
6733,"No wonder Disney gonna's make a fortune. First of all, the songs were amazing and the acting and dancing were great. The movie is longer, most of the scenes are more realistic, the directing and the acting seem to have vastly improved, and most importantly of all, the songs and the music are just AMAZING. The lyrics are beautiful, and nearly all of the songs are spectacular. With a longer length, there is more time to develop the characters, and this time is utilized wisely with a number of songs with amazing lyrics."
6742,"If Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time is considered an ode to the American Western with all it's fundamental elements all packed neatly in an 3 and a half hour package of visual splendor than Takashi Miike's Sukiyaki Western Django is an ode to the Italian Western through and through with all the style, violence and sound that Leone brought to the art of cinema and Sergio Corbucci used to create his most famous work "" Django "". A visual feast, Miike's tribute to Corbucci's work is the poetic equivalent of Tarantino's own tribute to the Italian Western (and some other cult genres) Kill Bill. Set around, in a strikingly offbeat way to, the 12th century Heike / Genji clan wars Sukiyaki Western Django is the tale of a mysterious gunman (played by Hideoki Ito) who comes into a nearly deserted once prospering town now controlled by the two rival groups. Though a tribute to Django this is nevertheless pure Miike cinema, expect that same weird humor, surreal kinetic action, with some sexual cues (although much restrained compared to some of his previous endeavors) he's become renowned for. It's a non stop joy ride beautifully shot, the impressive set design and backgrounds, the great costumes and yes a machine gun in coffin scene, pure poetry."
6766,"The comedy never reaches great heights, its a movie full of small laughs and the occasional bigger laugh. But the movies comedy really sparks when Mitchell and Webb are on screen together. The same formula Mitchell & Webb worked in Peep Show (and even That Mitchell and Webb Look) is here, Mitchell as the hesitant, well spoken guy who suddenly explodes in fits of rage and Webb as the more outspoken, confident guy with a ruthless, selfish edge to him. Oh, and there was a Q&A session with David and Rob after the screening and they were hilarious. The pair might just be able to make a big break in the movie business, this would be brilliant as the pair are very talented, and with a few more movies in their bag they might just become comedy icons."
6789,"Oguri Shun's character developed very well, from a clueless kid to a leader backed by many trustworthy friends. Genji (Oguri Shun), a son of yakuza boss must achieve an unprecedented unification of notorious Suzuran High School (AKA: Crow's High School) in order to take over his father's position. Based on a comic by Hiroshi Takahashi, Crows Zero is about Genji Takiya (Shun Oguri) who transfered to Suzuran Boy's School. Genji then seeks help and builds up his own army while defeating other minor' bosses', and eventually a showdown with Serizawa in his journey to the top of Suzuran High. Acting is strong all round, with Shun Oguri showing off a lot of his abilities."
6809,"Dr. Willard, his assistant Melissa (Louise Griffiths) and the students Rachel Fowles (Elize du Toit) and Brett Wilson (Matt Berry) head with Nick to the Blackwater Asylum finding the dreadful truth about the devil's chair. Andrew Howard gives a magnificent performance in the role of a man considered clinically insane and delusional that believes that fights against demons and supernatural forces. The gorgeous Elize du Toit is also excellent in the role of a student that intends to help Nick and finds the truth of the devil's chair. The main demon of flies which smells blood looks impressive and very Lovecraftian. But as the couple begin to go at it, their pleasurable experience turns into a nightmare: the chair â€” actually a portal to a hellish realm inhabited by a rapacious tentacled demon â€” traps Sammy, impales her with metal spikes and tendrils, and then whisks her body away."
6833,"Seeger himself appeared before the House Un-American Activities Committee in the mid-1950s, where he refused to sign a loyalty oath, resulting in his being blacklisted from TV for the next 17 years (it was the Smothers Brothers who eventually had the courage to buck the establishment and bring him back on). And rather than being annoying, the gentle harmonies will embrace you like your favorite warm jammies on a cold winter night. As another one of his songs goes, "" To everything turn, turn, turn "". Seeger acknowledges that he was a card - carrying Communist until "" around 1948, "" though he insists that his views are and were solidly rooted in American values. The hour - and - a-half this documentary is on screen flies by quickly and--for those old enough to remember--is a nostalgic walk through the life and career of the man whom many consider to be the premier folksinger of the age."
6834,"If you are a romantic one, and open to art movies, this will become a piece of your soul. The emotions are very powerful and you just cannot help but love the characters. Absolutely an instant masterpiece by Makoto Shinkai. Although the fast - pace Japanese language may be hard to get used to, the actors' whispers and thoughts are able to send out powerful emotions. "" It looks like Makoto Shinkai has directed another little minimalist masterpiece."
6835,"This film goes very deeply into the problems that Children with the form of Autism know as Aspergers syndrome. This is Greg Timmermans first film and he preformed beyond beautifully, bring subtlety to his role rarely seen by seasoned actors let alone a brand new face. May you see wide spread distribution and happy lives. In Belgian director Nic Balthazar's Ben X, Ben (Greg Timmermans) is not only highly intelligent but is different - very different. Ben X is visually stunning and the first feature - film for Greg Timmermans who, though he looks too old for the role, conveys Ben's internal struggle with amazing authenticity."
6855,""" Los cronocrÃ­menes "" is a terrific movie, one that was made with a low budget, a reduced cast, and very few settings. The feature length debut of Nacho Vigalondo is a pretty good science - fiction thriller with a sprinkle of horror thrown in. Messing with the time continuum always has dire consequences, and this film is a perfect example, but one thing that has always proved frustrating is being in the audience and just watching things unravel. A little bit of nudity provided by beautiful Barbara Goenaga certainly helps! Although many of the twists and turns of the story can be guessed quite early on, they are in some ways all the more enjoyable for that and Vigalondo impressively combines thriller, horror, dark comedy and even slapstick elements without making things feel forced."
6872,"Frontier (s) is a fast - paced, very violent thrill - ride from Xavier Gens. In October and November of 2005 there were a series of large - scale riots in France that stemmed from the death of two teenagers who lived in a low - income suburb of Paris. These recent events give Frontier (s) a healthy dose of sub-text as well as a realistic backdrop for its extreme violence. Fear and intolerance are now right beside baguettes and berets as France's main cultural identity. It's, by far, one of the most thrilling experiences in the land of gore movies for about the last 10 years."
6874,"Bruce appeared there in person and he was as charming, funny and charismatic as his alter egos on screen. Before and after the show, Bruce talked a bit about how making a film in one's hometown, how great it was for him to "" be able make a film and sleep in his own bed for the first time in 10 years "" and that you don't need a big Hollywood studio and a big blockbuster budget to make a good movie everyone can enjoy. No big celebrity names, exotic locations or blue screen studios were necessary in making this a real good movie. Something else in this movie that's uber - cool and cult fans will enjoy: Ted Raimi. Meanwhile, a young kid (who loves Bruce Campbell so much that he uses Army of Darkness quotes to pick up women, without much success) unwittingly unleashes a vengeful demon, and the townsfolk see the actor as their only means of survival."
6932,"Like Woody, Mouret not only writes and directs but is his own delicately droll romantic comedy lead--who combines suggestions of Mr. Allen with M. Jean - Pierre LÃ©aud and Mr. Petter Sellers. Perhaps because Mouret is a modest filmmaker, who works his way up gradually, adding a few more minutes each time: from 50, he went up to 76, then 85, and this time he's been bold enough to go to 100 minutes. This time, besides himself, following his well - received 2006 Change of Address / Changement d'adresse, which was part of the Diorector's Fortnight at Cannes, he's engaged Julie Gayet, Vieginie Ledoyen, and Stefano Accorsi as co-stars. Emilie and Gabriel are a sexy couple, and the suspension of that kiss really keeps viewers holding their breath even as they enjoy the surprises and machinations that now unfold. Mouret's humane and entertaining film is full of a sense of how delicate romantic feelings are and how seamlessly in a courtship the clumsy and the comic and the beautiful can blend into one another."
6933,"But the life scenes were attractive, it's like observing than watching. This slice of life is almost a documentary about how life on the edges is lived. Alejandro Polanco and Isamar Gonzales do an excellent job as a 12 - year - old brother and a 16 - year - old sister who live in a small room over an auto shop. Sleazy outskirts like these are not highlighted in the tour guides but Iranian - American director Ramin Bahrani puts them on vivid display in Chop Shop, a powerful Indie film that received much affection last year at Cannes, Berlin, and Toronto. A follow up to his acclaimed "" Man Push Cart "", Bahrani spent one and a half years in the location that F. Scott Fitzgerald described as in the Great Gatsby as "" the valley of the ashes ""."
6955,"As it is, he is sort of a child genius of fun fashion and cosmetics. The writing was first - rate and hilarious, and the performances were uniformly brilliant. There are plenty of laughs and poignant moments in equal measure, with the underlying theme of accepting and loving others for who they are. Aside from a few instances of salty language (including a couple "" f - bombs ""), it's family - friendly and the issues involved are handled with tact and gentle humor. The lives of Eric and Sam turn upside down with the boy and Eric gives his best efforts to give a father's influence to Scot."
6993,"The best thing about this movie, actually, what makes this movie really really good is the climax (operation yashima). The classic epic story is retold with amazing new animation, new sound effects, new music and new scenes. One of the most remarkable things about this movie is how easily the episodes translate into the arch of a feature length film. While the next three movies promise new story additions and characters, this movie contents itself with mostly cosmetic changes, along with tightening up the story, a few extra scenes, and eliminating some filler. You Are (Not) Alone is a pretty straightforward adaptation of the first six episodes of Evangelion."
7015,"Theroux does a fantastic job of fairly allowing the Phelps family to speak their minds about the issues without seeming smug or mean, and makes it clear that while is obviously against their message, he wants them to have a fair chance to express themselves. The specific, extreme behaviors of the Phelps clan may be isolated to the Phelpses, but the underlying subservience to doctrinal purity on display is way, way more prevalent in American society than is comfortable to admit. Would love to see and hear his thoughts and reactions at the end of each day of filming. Where he has much more success is with the children because they are quite normal people despite these views. He is able to put a human side on the group and extensively interviews Phelps family members."
7027,"In terms of SF, it's a mixed bag of genuinely inspired ideas in the form of a completely original alien world, and some familiar ideas from the humans. The story is unique to anything that is out there, uplifting, and creative all around. The animation is mostly superb & there are scenes where you actually feel like you're there on the planet thanks to some good 3 - D visualization. This Earthforce has discovered that the use of a Terraformer will make Terra habitable for humans but poisonous for Terrians. Their world is a wonderful amalgam of large mushroom like trees that they live in & they even have gliders that they travel around in."
7028,"Cheaply made movie that looks and feels cheaply made with a corny, stereotypical storyline thats been done multiple times. Paranormal CRAPTivity is a great idea. PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is THE most popular movie of the year and will ultimately be regarded as one of the best horror movies of all time. It was made a couple of years ago and yet it only became popular now because of all the hype. It's funny how the "" the scariest film in the history of cinema "" formula works every single time, like throwing bits of food at a pack of hungry dogs, they're always gonna go for it, and it's really sad, specially how American audiences are apparently so amazed by this rubbish."
7117,"His is a very precise shtick where finding the line and only going across it so much is like an art - you don't want to make it into a totally sensationalist exercise, but the audience still has to have a good time at not only others' expenses, but their own. It's not exactly a great documentary, but it's a fine showcase, and the kind of remembrance for one of those old kings of comedy that haven't yet kicked the bucket, like (unfortunately) so many in show - biz have in recent years. FOR A GREAT MANY years, from the 1930's thru the 1970's, it was considered to be a great honor to be insulted by Groucho Marx. Consisting of various actors and directors of note giving their (naturally) praise for the beloved comedian, interspersed with clips from his Vegas shows, late show appearances, old films, Friars' Roasts, and home movies with longtime friend, Bob Newhart. It's the story of the working life and an affectionate portrait of a man who, it seems, has practiced his trade of being "" the king of insults "" for 48 years and yet made no enemies?"
7146,"The other was the conversation between Anne and Capt Harville about women loving longest when all hope was gone, they moved the conversation to between Capt Bennick and Anne at a much earlier point in the film, and there's no sign Wentworth overhears them. She played Anne's emotions very well. A clever script manages, with all the cuts and changes which are invariably part of all adaptations, to distill the spirit of Jane Austen's novel unerringly. Wonderful leads (Rupert Penry - Jones is a warm - hearted, dashing Wentworth and Sally Hawkins is a delightfully sweet tempered Anne Elliot) and an outstanding supporting cast breathe life and immediacy into the plot. Creative film making ideas give the production a fresh face and make for memorable, visually gorgeous film moments."
7235,"Gervais's gags are more than adequate in that they service a chuckle, however stand up is more than gags, the greats are more then simply joke machines, they are jesters, actors and stylists. Ricky Gervais was number 49 on The Comedians' Comedian, he was number 18 on Britain's Favourite Comedian, and he was number 11 on 100 Greatest Stand - Ups."
7305,"Always loved flicks about serial killers and this found footage is one with that theme. As strange as The Poughkeepsie Tapes is it is a gem. It was made a good two years before the receding tide of found footage flicks out now. The almost comical fact of the matter is that when you closely examine serial killers on a personal level, they present themselves as plain and mundane, almost boring individuals most of the time, which in fact was what allowed a killer like Gary Ridgway to become THE most prolific American serial killer of all time, because though at many times he was a suspect, he was written off every single time because he seemed like such an average Joe, which by contrast the killer in THIS film was an extreme oddball. Cops are baffled by the cleverness of the killer."
7455,"C. K.'s standup special Chewed Up is one of the funniest stand up specials of recent years, and his followup specials have consistently performed above average in quality. Like George Carlin, Louis CK has the ability to show that anything, no matter how mean - spirited or dark, has the capacity to be funny, if not hilarious. However, Louis C. K.: Shameless may be his weakest installment, although still able to provide capable entertainment for fifty - five minutes."
7543,"but this current one will be much more enjoyed by the purists. The actor playing Henry Tilney was charming (maybe more than the book Henry Tilney in fact) and all the others seemed to fit their roles. Carey Mulligen (Bleak House, The Amazing Mrs. Prichard) is a young actress who really understands period drama, and can bring her full self to it without seeming modern. As an interpreting of J. Austen, the movie plays with many internal thoughts belonging to people within a romantic tradition of the end of 18th century."
7553,"Those scenes are well worth the price of admission. Even though their interaction is between two gay characters and two characters far apart in age it transcends those particulars to capture emotional human truths and longings relevant and recognizable to everyone. It touches upon a lot of aspects of gay culture, some of the unpleasant aspects are portrayed in a raw and almost disturbing manner. As others have commented, the scene where the 14 year old boy and the loner encounter at home is dramatic, tense and well acted. Their scenes together are quite moving."
7628,"Then comes his latest film "" Fados, "" a heady mix of dance and melancholic Portuguese folk song rendered by mesmerizing singers such as Mariza and Carlos do Carmos One of the film's greatest services is to show, via the excellent subtitles, the sublime folk poetry that makes up much of the lyrics of Fado. The film is composed of performances by the top Fado artists from Portugal (Mariza, Carlos do Carmo.) Mariza shows now, well supported by the right people, and she took musically fado to a new artistic level. Go back in history, and you will recall his most famous film, "" Cria cuervos (cry ravens) "" (1975) featured a song called "" Porque te vas (Because you are leaving) "" sung by an American singer called Janette who was living at that time in Spain."
7645,"Here you have a great guy that is willing to do anything for you and what do you do? at the first sigh, a simple, ordinary story about friendship, love, every day problems, problems and decisions. for the precise picture of a group of guys, different, nice, in middle of clash between feelings and choices and dialogues and physical attraction. Ephram, filled with ambition, gives Trevor hope. Ephram, a man of strikingly good looks, offers Trevor warmth."
7982,"This man, ney, hyphenate, who not only had the vision but the talent todeliver this level of quality is homage to the fact that anyone with enough desire and strong enough dream can make it all happen. It's amazing that this piece of work was realized in only 4 years."
8103,"But in such a quick burst of minor creativity he has created a stark, amusing and tragic little situation that makes clearer (if not totally clear) the disconnect between Jack (Schwartzmann's character from Darjeeling Limited) and the' ex-girlfriend' (Portman, with her V for Vendetta cut coming back in and her attitude like that of a pure b *** ch). As a part of the Darjeeling Limited feature it is a solid couple of scenes but not more or less remarkable than the rest of the film. Regardless it does have good stuff in the style, the performances, the simmering emotion and the overall delivery but it badly needed to either be part of the film or expanded and strengthened to be able to stand alone as a short film that "" connects "" to the feature rather than being "" connected "" to it (if you appreciate the difference). But you'll have to see The Darjeeling Limited to see how this love story ends. Though shot before The Darjeeling Limited, apparently the idea behind it is to create a better understanding of Natalie Portman's character's relationship to Jason Schwartzman's character."
8291,"A self - important, smug, condescending man who has little time to expend on treating patients who will not attain a spot for his name in medical journals. Realization of Strange's character is okay as far as it goes, which is not far, but the romance and the family backplot are unnecessary and consume far too much of the film. Throughout the comic book series, Dr. Strange gave a much stronger impression of willful mastery of magic, yet here he is rather the reluctant hero, which was never present in the original. the action scenes are very well done. Dr. Strange is a likable character from bad to good you know he's special."
8391,"It was shown at ImageOut, the Rochester Lesbian and Gay Film and Video Festival. Not the best movie in terms of script, direction, acting and dialogue, but the ending was OK and there was potential here for the two leads to develop a heartfelt LTR. The production values weren't bad. Both actors, in both movies, needed more fire, more energy, more passion for their characters. See the interesting stories, grieve for the lagging moments, and wish for vehicles and directors that will give these actors and these kinds of stories the platform to achieve lift - off."
8515,"And It's awesome in all aspects of the word. If you are into arse kicking samurai's and Samuel L. Jackson. If shows like Ghost in the Shell appeals to the higher reasoning and logical portions of the brain and Grave of the Fireflies appeal to the emotional centers, Afro Samurai would be a show that appeals to the most basic drives of human cognition. The highly stylized art works well for such a show, containing an exceptionally high level of detail more common in feature film animation than in a direct - to - DVD miniseries. A highly original concept recommended for fans who are bored with your typical shonen anime and looking for something new, refreshing and just oozing with ATTITUDE."
8545,"This was the fourth project written and directed by Rasper, and it won several awards at European film festivals. Not to be outdone in the year 2007, of some quite good gay films (the Yank's "" Shelter "" and the Brit's "" Oh Happy Day ""), now comes along Germany's funnily enjoyable "" Fashion Victims . "" Speaking of "" war, "" perhaps this is the best point to mention that "" Fashion Wars "" might have been a far better film title, inasmuch as it certainly does have its share of skirmishes (well, admittedly, its share of "" victims, "" too). FASHION VICTIMS (Reine Geschmacksache) is an entertaining little film that seems to have its roots in the French farce genre: characters running topsy turvy into situations that include hidden identities, well paced plans that go awry for odd reasons, and in general a healthy look at human foibles. Grumpy egocentric Wolfgang Zenker (Edgar Selge) is first a clothing line salesman in the fashion industry and second an abusive husband to Erika (Franziska Walser) and his closeted son Karsten (Florian BartholomÃ¤i), a young lad who yearns to go off to university to study Spanish but is shamed into being a driver for his father when the police reveal that Wolfgang has a suspended license."
8107,"Like physicist Sheldon "" embracing the chaos "" or using classical conditioning techniques on his roommate's girlfriend. First three or four seasons: Solid gold; funny, good plot lines. The first few seasons are, for the most part, extremely fantastic, focused, funny, fresh, intelligent and even at times, brilliant. The first three seasons of this show are the worth to watch. In fact, this show ratings and success is based upon these three seasons."
6649,"But the World Premiere of Harold & Kumar Escape from Gauntanamo Bay last night as Austin's SXSW Film Festival was simply awesome. The audience loved America's favorite slackers on their next adventure as their trip to Amsterdam goes incredibly wrong. While there are times when Harold & Kumar's antics are just plain silly, they are also incredible human characters who are struggling with real challenges around parents, romance, friendship, the law, and race. Rod Corddry provides a wonderful addition to the cast as the completely paranoid government agent. Unlike the first film which gained a cult following on DVD, Harold and Kumar Escape from Guatanamo Bay will undoubtedly be a huge hit in the theaters."
7002,"It is not his style and it doesn't make you forget the failings in substance, but it is engaging as pure style. Refn's screenplay with Brock Norman Brock did escape the rules of viewer engagement from time to time with its extreme bizarreness, but somehow it boldly & bloody worked. The result of this approach is not a film that is to be relied on for the facts of the story but it is one that really delivers a quite dizzying film in terms of borrowed styles, impact, violence and sheer over-the top bravado. The saving grace though is that the whole thing is excessive and full - on from the director, an approach which in turn draws an intense and bravely excessive performance from Hardy that makes this really worth watching even if it has a lot of problems in it and around it. With a classically - weighted score married to scenes of ultra-violence, this not only pays homage to Kubrick, but also to mavericks like Lindsay Anderson, Peter Greenaway and John Maybury (' Love Is The Devil') in its picaresque digressions and painterly aesthetics: a cinematic palate of reds and blacks."
6635,"There was an interesting metaphor contained in one of the trailers showing Drillbit telling the kids he's taking them under his wing. The young actors who play the 3 freshman high - school boys are absolutely perfect in their parts. This isn't a smart make you think comedy, but it had heart in the right places and it was very funny none the less. Overall though, any film from the Apatow organization is going to be 6 times funnier and more inventive than the average movie comedy out there. The beauty of this movie it combines the two genres with Owen Wilson's natural comedic talent and three capable younger actors resulting in a mostly funny comedy that is unique from the rest."
7005,"Their relationship, masterfully played out by Arta Dobroshi and returning Dardenne brother favourite JÃ©rÃ©mie Renier, is utterly, intensely fascinating. Her optimism and strength are quickly torn apart when the man responsible for arranging both her marriages quickly yanks her down to reality by reminding her that she is little more then a pawn for people who want to cheat the system. And yet the movie is still compelling, quietly questioning a system in which people must go to such violent lengths in order to obtain simple and innocent desires. Arta Dobroshi is literally on screen for every single scene, and for all but a few seconds of the film: an amazing performance. The Dardenne brothers, those impressive Belgian filmmakers, are at it again."
7006,"He likes the basic sounds of the guitars, he doesn't mess with it that much. It works not only because the script is neatly put together, weighing and balancing the differences, but because somewhere around the beginning of the film something becomes very clear: despite being about the guitar and despite being very different men from different times of the rock history, they share their love for music and their desire to change the world through it. The opening credits are pretty cool. It really is amazing to watch Edge go over the technicalities involved in creating his trademark style. There are all these magical moments best summed up when the noodling Edge and Jack White stop what they are doing and turn smiling like idiots as Jimmy Page starts playing Whole Lotta Love."
6820,"The filmmakers tried to copy the' style' of the first movie, and in some aspects they succeeded. For example, the federation broadcasts of the first movie were fantastic because they carried a lot of atmosphere and had so much subtle irony included. There are a lot of broadcasts and they do a good job helping to create the film's atmosphere, but they are so openly ironic and sometimes it's almost comedy. Maybe he should have oriented his work more on the fantastic score of Basil Poledouris from the first movie. The "" bugs "" are more detailed and everyone has been upgraded - the bugs have XXL - scorpions and humans have, well, shovels."
6847,"But too has this vibrant and adept filmmaker paid great notice to the neo-realists of yesteryear, particularly De Sica (the entire film can almost be seen as a contemporized Umberto D.)."
8600,"Like Stephen Chow made for Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Street, Cem Yilmaz made the same affect in Turkish cinema in G. O. R. Not better than G. O. R. A. but it is still very good. A and A. R. O. G, not same success in special effects but seems satisfying and good enough. A. R. O. G is the second movie of the successful Turkish comedy G. O. R. A. Director, writer and actor Cem Yilmaz created an excellent movie again. A. R. O. G. is an successful example of modern Turkish comedy."
6805,"But still while this movie doesn't really stand out and it is incredibly predictable, there are some really fun moments. Vince had some moments as well, but it's more the supporting cast that was just a fun addition to the story. Another potentially funny Hollywood comedy hits the skids when it encounters a message. Mr. Vaughn is truly at his best in the moments of rapid fire dialogue as he helplessly tries to avoid another ridiculous situation. After last years foray into Christmas movies with the comedy without the comedy Fred Claus, Vince Vaughn is back this year again with another festive attempt - Four Christmases with Reese Witherspoon."
6802,"That permanent smile defining his face talks volumes about his faith in people, no matter what. His awareness is filled with truth and innocence, he worries he's about to be 40 and hasn't accomplished anything. The film is constructed brilliantly in a series of vignettes that builds up into a whole fluid narrative. All around this structure, the direction skilfully grows - up the flesh of the human content, social layers and ethical matters. Milk was one of the best films of 2008, watch it, learn from it, and remember: do onto others as you would do onto yourself."
6634,"At the thematic level, the movie is about accepting responsibility for your actions, controlling your emotions, and making good choices. You've got rich kids running around in massive mansions driving expensive cars, but that's just the setting. The heart of the movie is about personal growth and making choices. It's definitely worth the price of a rental, and worth the $10 to see it in theaters, if you've got no other plans. It went to great lengths to make a Classical reference from the Iliad significant thematically, and how often does a "" teensploitation "" flick do that?"
6646,"Mazin, The main spoof is spider man they also spoof Batman, the Fantastic Four, and the X-Men. The most pitiable is a take - off on disabled genius Stephen Hawking, who seems to push Mazin's bad - taste button over and over ad nauseum. It's a comedy that takes a well - known hit (in this case, "" Spider - Man ""), turns it inside out, and uses it as a clothesline for gags. One of the key things about the best spoof movies, like Airplane is that although the dialog is extremely funny, the cast for the most part play is completely straight. The spoofs range from clever to cringe - worthy, but the story and resultant gags follow the source material (mostly 2002's Spider - Man) very well, as opposed to the "" Hey, look!"
6848,"If you're expecting a movie that will entertain, be free of gratuitous sex scenes and violence with a charming backdrop of London landmarks, then this film is for you. LAST CHANCE HARVEY is a breath of fresh air amongst a sea of dark dramas up for kudos. The London locations, the brilliant chemistry between Emma and Dustin, and the joy one finds in their histories and luck in finding each other in London is wonderful to enfold on the screen. The writing is superb from Joel Hopkins, the London locations so fantastic to the story and film, and the supporting cast is excellent. Both Harvey Shine (Hoffman) and Kate Walker (Thompson) at this stage in their lives seem to be lost but carry on with determination."
6703,"The Beast with a Billion Backs is the second in an extension of the Futurama animated series, now being released as a fully fledged movie experience. In terms of plot the demands of a ninety minute episode are far greater, and the transition itself hasn't been entirely smooth. Its this level of confidence that made the Simpsons great, but as that animated dinosaur now bludgeons the viewer with the obvious, slapstick humour one would expect of a cheesy 80's sitcom, creator Groening is letting bad trends slip into an otherwise rejuvenating series. A rift between two alternate universes appears above Earth, and immediately people assume the worst. Overall The Beast of a Billion Backs is an odd experience worthwhile to just about any Futurama fan."
6849,"That's a bit of a moot point, though, since most people will watch this for the action scenes. The film moves forward at a brisk pace and contains a surprisingly large amount of fight scenes. Directed by Wilson Yip (Killzone, Flashpoint) This movie is a "" portrayal "" of the famous Wing Chun master Yip Man, credited as being the guy that taught Bruce Lee kung fu. The fighting is very well choreographed, and the stunts are really amazing. And as a "" World War II side - story "" about a simple people in a small place (Foshan, China), there are only a few lines of text and transitional scenes depicting the Japanese invasion / occupation of Foshan (the director didn't have the budget to show how Foshan lost 3/4 of its population)--though it manages to be quite effective, especially for those already familiar with the history."
6647,"It's a well crafted film, with very good gun fighting scenes that tends to become a bit overboard, but still realistic enough. If there is any significant achievement it's in taking the cop movie into such depraved depths it's like looking at a very entertaining infected boil: you know it'll pop any minute, and the pus might just run out a little bit here and there till there's more to squeeze out. David Ayer, the director (and writer of Training Day, the perennial new millennium corrupt - cop saga), does have a good handle on the material though, even with ham - bone performance; Forest Whitaker is one of them, sadly, as he basically retreads his persona from The Last King of Scotland as the "" King "" of the corrupt cops. There are some great shootout scenes, and whatever you do, don't get in Ludlow's way, because he will take you out."
6801,"Bolt also reclaims the original song work of Disney past, conceived between its also star and teen sensation Miley Cirus and Jenny Lewis and both compilations are memorable and sweet. The super-bark and laser eye scenes are so hilarious, in a cute and mesmerising way. Coupled with the expectedly bright crisp animation and stellar voice work, makes Bolt better yet, and a sure contender for best animated film at this years Oscars. Bolt opens with a very entertaining action sequence in which Bolt (voiced to surprising effect by John Travolta) and his master Penny (Miley Cirus) are chased by well equipped super villains which plays out in the vein of The Incredibles. Bolt never dives for the heartstrings, but scores its emotional points through well developed characters and thoughtful situations."
6851,"The animation is superb, and the characterizations deeply engaging. The character differentiation is very strong in the mice & rats--and all that tender - loving detail in Ratworld and Mouseworld! -- who bring an amazing richness and authenticity to the characterizations."
6821,"The language used in the film treats the situation very carefully and the confrontations between the characters crackle with well - written intensity. Great performances, wonderful writing and tough themes. By the way, genial idea of using male names for the Catholic nuns, to stress out the strictness of their rules. Streep has been on top for some time now and Hoffman has an unmatched resume of fine performances over the past five years. Other than some jarring oblique angle shots the camera compositions and set design provide a somber ambiance for the drama and an arena for the perfectly measured performances by two masters of the craft in this fight to the finish that remains absorbing from beginning to end."
6651,"That is true, but Angarano plays the role well and the character adds substance to the story. First of all it is a great action movie with very well done kung fu action scenes involving Jackie Chan and Jet Li, two of the greatest kung fu movie stars in the past couple of decades. Jackie Chan returns in a Drunken Master (1978) role along with Jet Li in a more mysterious but delightful twisting role in this fantasy martial arts film that requires a leap of faith into myths, legends, and magic."
6715,"o_O Eddie Murphy is awesome as both Dave (the ship) and its captain, and the supporting cast is brilliant. whoever it was that said the whole premise is silly and laughable is forgetting one important thing about these kind of movies: They're fantasy entertainment. Humor, warmth, a friendship / self - confidence message, faith in the good in humans, it's all there and wonderfully done. Of course the plot is more than unlikely, but that's the beauty of movies in general - they can take you to an imaginary world and let you be amazed at the "" what - ifs . "" It rocks, from the first minute to the last."
6822,"It's absolutely hilarious at times (watch as Kowalski attempts to make a man out of Thao by teaching him how to talk like men do), and Eastwood handles the shifts in tone brilliantly. Whether or not "" Gran Torino "" will hold up as one of Eastwood's great films remains to be seen, and the film feels like it would be good for multiple viewings. At times it plays like Lynch's' Straight Story' with sprinkles of' Taxi Driver' but the real beauty is in the old fashioned storytelling, something that Clint is a dab hand at, mix that with the modern day context and you have a gripping and enthralling film. Good acting from Clind as well as all his supporting actors and once again Clint has shown that he is capable of making movies that involves both emotions and stereotypes! There are some wonderful performances in "" Milk "" (Sean Penn), "" Australia "" (Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman), "" Changeling "" (Angelina Jolie and director Clint Eastwood), and "" The Dark Knight "" (a riveting performance by "" Brokeback Mountain's "" Heath Ledger)."
7025,"The fact that the vast Walmart is switching to organic foods because customers want them shows people vote effectively with their pocketbooks every time they buy a meal. Informed by the voices and outlook of bestseller authors Eric Schlosser (' Fast Food Nation') and Michael Pollen (' The Omnivore's Dilemma'), this new film is an exposÃ© that offers some hope that things can be made better through grassroots efforts. Kenner offers lots of practical information and appeals to everyday people. E-Coli outbreaks and other food - safety related issues are discussed in the outstanding documentary Food, Inc., directed by Robert Kenner, a film, graphic in part, that may leave you with a severe case of indigestion. An important spokesman in' Food, Inc.' is an organic farmer (you could just say a stubbornly old - fashioned one) called Joel Salatin of Polyface Farm in Swoope, Virginia, who's also an author, though the movie doesn't mention his books."
6858,"Mo (Brendan Fraser) is good father, happily married who has a special talent to bring personages out of books. One night he brings out various characters named Capricorn and Basta from Inkheart, a book written by Fenoglio (Jim Broadbent) whose story is set in Middle Age and plenty of magical beings. Now, 10 years later Meggie (Eliza Bennett) discovers the truth and she also has supernatural powers. Meggie along with his father and grandmother confront several fantastic adventures, dangers and risks. This exciting motion picture displays derring - do adventure, romance, fairy tale, and spectacular frames with phenomenal production design."
6661,"Neither idea is the most original or the jokes the most successful, in fact the plot falls on an abuse of sexual humor that at times results unnecessary and it only is used to start a laughter of a story that had no where to find the funny. She goes to Scotland on business and Patrick's character realizes he has actually fallen in love with her now that shes gone. A very safe romantic comedy that plays exactly by the rules and wins the general audience over because it manages to have the key ingredient that makes this genre work: chemistry between likable leads. But if you enjoy romantic comedies and want a good laugh this one is definitely worth seeing. Maybe such "" wedding "" movies and romantic "" shaggy dog "" stories can never be better than this."
6699,"Familiar characters, props, music, jokes and lines all brought back fond memories of a delightful TV series. Unlike previous film adaptations of old television series that only superficially resembled their TV series counterpart, this film can truly be considered a big screen version of the Get Smart TV series. The new "" Get Smart "" does a masterful job of capturing the style, tone and humor of the '60s series, while transporting it into a modern sensibility. On the other hand, the production values were all first - rate and contemporary, including a CGI effect of an aerial fly - around and push - in to a 747 that was reminiscent of the key shot in the pilot of Star Trek. Steve Carrell makes a very reasonable Agent 86; where Don Adams played the character as a bumbling naif, Carrell makes him into a goodhearted wannabe who, despite having the kind of personality that renders him invisible in society, still has intelligence and an earnestness that can make him into hero material when he works at it."
7029,"This part becomes interesting, as directors talk about troubles with stunts (involving tragic deaths of cameramen and stuntmen), injuries and actor problems. The directors, actors and those influenced (Greg McLean (Wolf Creek / Rouge), James Wan and Leigh Whannell (Saw)) share the stories of a fledgling film industry that embraced a Guerrilla style of film - making that stuck it to the stuffy cinema elite that wished they would disappear. Like any good documentary, it's a real eye opening experience to get an insight into the lost world of blood, bikers and boobs. Hopefully (and it DOES look hopeful), Australia can start to release some great Ozploitation style films. This extremely entertaining and informative low - budget documentary traces the revival of the Australian film industry, which all but died at the mid-30's Pacific onset of WWII, from its fledgling late 60's re-birth, through its multi-faceted heyday in the 70's and early 80's."
6610,"It's as if Hollywood's main concern is satisfying it's teenage market segment over all others. Matthew fox acting could be better, but the others are convincing. It also has a really great car chase scene and this is coming from someone who usually doesn't "" get "" those. Sometime it does and it really helps the film, but mostly it's not the vantage points, but cutting the story off at pivotal moments and clues into the mystery so that when they're revealed in another perspective you can get excited. The premise of this film makes a refreshing change from the ordinary style of mainstream movies."
7033,"The movie paints the entire gamut of emotional family experience with delicate yet powerful brush strokes but it's not a sentimental film, nor an opportunity for actors to grandstand. It's Japanese, so all the strong undercurrents of emotion are held in check by equally powerful restraint (both cultural and directorial). Anybody who has ever spent the night at the house of relatives will feel the weight of family history that this film captures so truthfully. This movie has many emotional surprises that make the audience gasp, but they are presented with a sure, light touch, never falling into easy sentiment, never shying away from human complexity. ' Still Walking', the stunning new film from Japanese director Hirokazu Koreeda, begins with a premise so stale and overused that to read a plot synopsis of the movie is discouraging enough to prevent you from seeing it."
6609,"Watch this one on a second or third date OR watch it with someone you've known for a while who you are about to reveal your feelings to. If you're a 20 something that has been in and out of some significant relationships, this will hit close to home, in a positive way. Anyone who has ever traded a trip on the QEII for a proverbial three hour tour on the S. S. Minnow relationship-wise will totally relate. The script isn't belly - laugh funny but it has it's moments, there's some good use of news footage from the time in which the story is set, and the plot ticks over nicely. When his ten - year - old daughter starts asking awkward questions about his impending divorce - and his life before she was born - a thirtysomething Manhattan dad sits her down and tells her the story of his three great loves."
6611,"The Spiderwick Chronicles undeniably makes fantasy and magic fun. With pleasing characters, family - friendly magical adventure and a mind - bogglingly fantastical world of faeries, goblins and ogres, The Spiderwick Chronicles is extraordinarily entertaining fantasy fun. Jared (Freddie Highmore) is a curious, adventurous boy who quickly seeks out the hidden cob - web - covered remains of great great uncle Arthur Spiderwick's laboratory. With sensationally mirthful creature designs and likable human characters, topped with state - of - the - art special effects, The Spiderwick Chronicles is another big win for Paramount and a high bar for family films of 2008. The Spiderwick Chronicles is, on the surface, an alluringly delightful fantasy that blends the very best of character designs, both human and CG, into a story that effortlessly engrosses without stumbling out of the realm of suspended disbelief."
6860,"Nice cast, Nice Script, and everything is handled a hell of a lot more intelligently than what you'd expect from a movie which is essentially' Giant Alien Vs Vikings'. The acting is good enough, with the Christian Bale look - alike Caviezel, and the great but short performance of Ron Perlman, it manages to be captivating. Outlander is worth a look and even if you don't like it, you can't deny how perfectly it defines the so - bad - it's - good adage. James Caviezel was excellent as usual as was Sophia Myles - to think of it, there wasn't a bum note in the cast and the script was fine. Outlander is the living proof, that such a combination can result in a very good and entertaining 115 minutes."
6920,"Almost forty years ago, Johnny Carson gave Buck Howard the title "" The Great Buck Howard "" and it stuck. It's quite a gentle, unusual comedy, so morals behind this movie are hard to get. However, this is a good film worth watching and definitely should be shown as an example of outstanding acting from Malkovich to Star Trek actor George Takei. "" The Great Buck Howard "" has a unconventional beginning, with coloured subtitles helping to get points across. He is a classic 70s Vegas magician, doing fascinating tricks and metal feats of amazement."
8541,"So, there are interesting gay - themed movies, but 3 - day weekend isn't one of them. Mitchell's "" Shortbus "" has a decent scene that shows the aging and isolation theme in a brief but immensely better manner. It's worth watching, especially if you enjoy studies in characters and their relationships. The use of "" threes "" is deftly threaded throughout the film. And Cameron felt like he was just there to be there, though he would have made an interesting foil of sorts for Andre."
6823,"The behind the scenes of the famous David Frost, Richard Nixon interviews pale in comparison to the compelling sight of Nixon / Langella thinking. As someone who grew up during the Watergate hearings, and who reviled Nixon as the embodiment not just of corruption but of the worst kind of interventionist, even genocidal, American politics, this film gives substance to a man who, in later years (especially the GW Bush years, which make Nixon look like a political and intellectual colossus), achieved something of a place in history beyond the scandal of Watergate. In Nixon strange emotions were brought up towards the man himself, in here Nixon seems to be quite a very good man. Many scenes though were quite intense but this movie was carried by the writing of Peter Morgan. Like other Ron Howard movies it doesn't take a giant leap of greatness."
6811,"Spike Lee could do this movie with the same actors (except Beyonce, please use Sharon Jones) and win a Grammy. ' Cadillac Records' is an admirable attempt to tell the tale of the legendary Chess Records, which did for Blues what Atlantic Records did for R&B / Soul, Jazz, Rock & Roll, etc. . Like this movie, Beyonce's performance is overblown and lacks any character or soul. Flashy glimpses into the glamorous styles of the 1950s and 60s include loving looks at the many Cadillacs Chess gives as gifts to his star performers. Beyonce Knowles is very beautiful and pays worthy tribute to Etta James, the singer she plays."
6696,"As bullets curve, heads get punctured, hilarity ensues, and rats explode (peanut butter rocks, BTW), you'll smile besides yourself. Some interesting visuals aside, it's movies like this that give the term "" comic book movie "" a bad reputation."
6731,"But all the girls are a pleasure to watch on screen, they make you laugh and just have a great time with their journeys. That film had zest and a breath of fresh air with one specific story affecting the lives of others. Maybe people didn't listen enough or didn't quite understand what wasn't said but overall, everything fell right into place."
6863,Except this one exceeds it by far in terms of pointless sadism.
6814,"Classic Aardman animation is nigh - on unbeatable entertainment and from a technical stand - point, this sets new boundaries whilst somehow retaining its earlier charm - fingerprints are still visible on characters clothes and noses so one assumes that Aardman's undoubted success still hasn't brought anyone at the studio gloves. But while the animation has improved, there isn't as much humour in this short as the others. Gone are the glorious and original set - pieces like the train - set chase from "" The Wrong Trousers "" and they are replaced with endless references and in - jokes instead of their own ideas. But this is still Wallace and Gromit, still as quintessentially English as earl grey tea and still quality entertainment. Watching Wallace and Gromit has become a Christmas tradition so it is always good when a new story is added to their collection."
6865,"The martial arts skill of Yanin Vismitananda is very impressive and the choreography of the fights is perfect, giving the sensation that they are for real. A true fan of action movies has the ability to overlook some flaws in film - making (e. g., script, acting, character development, etc.) if the action sequences are exceptional enough to make up for them. JeeJa Yanin â€“ an amazing specimen with her fluid moves and hard strikes â€“ catapults herself into the upper echelon of female action stars with this single movie. Virtually all of the remaining 50 minutes is devoted to high quality choreography and bone - crunching maneuvers. The main girl Zen (Yanin Vismitananda) is very talented."
6607,"Like Superman, Spiderman, Batman, Daredevil, X-men, Fantastic 4. So he grows up to become a rich globe trotter (where is the IRS when you need them), courtesy of bank vaults he can enter undetected, "" jumping "" from one end of the Earth to another, living the high life. Stunning effects, swooping camera angles, and an interesting concept more than make up for the film's defects - namely Hayden Christensen - reprising the gloomy, wounded, misunderstood, petulant anti-hero role he played so ineffectively in the Star Wars prequels. The answer, of course, will probably be' No' as this film seems to have been made with the idea of sequels firmly in sight. No, they never reach the coolness of Nightcrawler from X-Men 2, but they are very well done."
7051,"So eventually it's up to one guy to be the voice of reason and make everything right. Everything from peer pressure, the effects of apathetic and absent parents, and the apathy and angst of teenagers gets touched on and done quite well. "" F--ing brilliant "" claims AICN, Etc, etc. . It's an interesting premise, and the film looks artistic enough in shot choices so you know it's not an over glossed, pre-packaged, Hollywood, cooking cutter film. Horror films, at their best, provide some fun scares, and a chilling moment or two, but bottom line: "" It's a zombie girl getting raped for two hours . """
7052,"The first thing that strikes you about this movie is how accurately they managed to capture the look of the Hammer period horrors, the atmosphere is set with lots of fog laden graveyards, rowdy tavern scenes and excellent set / costume design. The movie is genuinely scary in places, then it'll suddenly flip back into hilarious mode, keeping you totally off balance. Most of the various stories are good, specifically the alien, the Murphy's and the vampire, but others weren't so great. This is a fun movie for teens and adults (no younger kids), it really does have it's scary moments. Some parts are scary and funny at the same time."
6824,"Even though its been 63 years since the blood - drenched annals of World War II, its aftermath today is still bone chilling. Adapted from Bernhard Schlink's best - selling German novel, "" The Reader, "" Daldry's visual translation is a powerful, emotionally absorbing film that is one of the year's best. With World War II over, Germany, in 1958, is still recovering. Too young to understand love's complicated implications, Michael is emotionally devastated when Hanna suddenly disappears. "" The Reader "" is a film that is driven by it's raw performances."
7057,"Almost as good are a strange prom date between an awkward boy (Anton Yelchin) and the wheelchair - bound daughter (Olivia Thirlby) of an eccentric, pushy pharmacist (James Caan) and a slick bit wherein Hayden Christensen as a smart alecky pickpocket goes up against Andy Garcia as a college professor who turns the tables on him in the manner of Miriam Hopkins and Herbert Marshall in the 1932 classic TROUBLE IN PARADISE. Standing apart from all other segments is the lovely character study of a married couple (Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman) bickering gently as they walk to the seashore to commemorate their 63rd wedding anniversary â€“ beautiful acting by two old masters. In Allen Hughes's segment there is some excellent internal monologue writing by Alexandra Cassavetes and Stephen Winter about two insecure people on their way to their second date with each other, wonderfully enacted by Drea De Matteo and Bradley Cooper. Other than one episode in Brighton Beach and one in Chinatown, the action takes place in well - heeled sections of Manhattan. Both have O. Henry - type twist endings that make them ultimately entertaining."
6800,"It had terrific sets and was a beautiful setting, it felt like watching one of the old classic movies that made you feel good. If Luhrmann is doing anything as a filmmaker (in addition to running his career with one ballet shoe firmly in the closet), he's channeling the spirit of the late, great Liberace with his over-the-top bonanzas of glitter, camp and intolerable clichÃ©s. While clichÃ©'s and political agenda runs rife, this is set nicely into an historic, epic story in three distinct acts. Baz Luhrmann has done a great job with' Australia'. What Luhrmann does well with Australia is tap into the majestic allure of the outback, and amplifies it."
6650,Fans of anime will seriously lap this up despite what the recent comments have said. Performances were quite impressive given it's a predominantly' kids' PG film and that they were filming against green screen. Serious or more intimate moments had darker shadows while remaining colourfully vibrant. That way the movie will exceed your expectations. It's rated PG and appropriate for all ages.
6810,"Bobby is played by Michael Fassbender, who gives a quietly powerful performance. There have been many fantastic films about the Irish Struggles, with some of the best coming in recent years (Ken Loach's fantastic Wind that Shakes the Barley, and Paul Greengrass's Bloody Sunday, to name two of the better). McQueen captures his scenes in jarring compositions, with all the skill and artistic imagining of a true artist. The cinematography and direction are assured, moving slowly and unexpectedly, always beautifully even in its darkest and dirtiest moments. Steve McQueen, a noted young British artist, has made a powerful first film about the Irish prisoners in H - Block of Maze Prison, Northern Ireland, and the hunger strike and death of Bobby Sands in 1981."
8496,"Viewers should be able to recognize "" Ghost In The Shell "" as "" Innocence ""'s predecessor from the title, the story and promotional material. One other reviewer mentioned that this seemed like something George Lucas would do, and if you saw the "" new "" Star Wars films that came out in the 1990s with added scenes and (crappily done) CGI, you've had a taste of what was done with GITS 2. The jaw - dropping intro and title sequences from the original GITS are ruined for that very reason. The classic animation utilised in the original film looked amazing, and removing some of these classic masterpiece animations and intercutting them with new CGI stuff looks and feels, well, wrong. There were little scenes where they would do a bit more of the CG and half of it is rather pretty."
6614,"If you want a good movie about Henry VIII and Anne Bolyen, rent Anne of the Thousand Days. On the other hand, the film is engaging and the costumes lovely. Same with the gorgeous palace settings. The story has a Hollywood layer to give the story a little more "" oomph "" sort of speak, like most other pictures, but The Other Boleyn Girl is still a very decent movie. The Boleyn has quite a family, a mother, father, a son, and two daughters."
6928,"Second, though the film is called a musical, and there are indeed songs, the use of music is surprisingly sparing. Timothy discovers in Shakespeare's prose a recipe for a magical pansy, which when sprayed in the face of various townspeople allows them to "" walk in his shoes "". Amusing complications ensue, along with the stuff of dreams as Jonathan expresses his love for Timothy. It pays loving homage to Shakespeare and free spirits and appears beautifully rendered on a limited budget. The musical numbers are few, but effective and carried out by a well - selected cast."
6929,"The film had a good balance of the history of the play, the past performers and performances, and the new hopefuls. It was interesting to see that the audition process, with callbacks, went on for months. How amazing to listen to the interviews with the dancers back in 1974 which provided the inspiration for the musical! The device of looking at the creation of A CHORUS LINE through the process of the auditions for a revival of A CHORUS LINE works very well indeed, and everybody with grease paint in their veins will respond. In between the filmmaker interviews old players from "" A Chorus Line ""'s impressive legacy and culls bits from the original tape archives that established the framework of the '75 classic as well as the Broadway revival."
6542,"All the classic movies and blockbusters this film refers to are some of the most memorable movies that played during the VHS days and, in a way,' Be Kind Rewind' is a superb homage to those films. Even in its most boring sections, Def delivers a great performance that is insightful and more introspective of what the film could have been had Gondry put more effort into it. Using many different angles and stylistic devices, Gondry remakes specific scenes out of these movies with ease, and brings a lot of humour to them as well. Gondry has tackled a lot of themes like a strong sense of community, people's love for movies, people being accustomed to old technology (as a result to which they sometimes have difficulty moving on to more updated sources), reviving loved artists who have vanished into oblivion and the overall sense of doing something great together (like the last movie on Fat Waller's life). The first film they make is' Ghostbusters' and it sets the premises of what is to come as they do their own versions of' Robocop, Lion King, Rush Hour 2 and Men in Black to name but a few."
6639,"Reason 1: Special guest audience only, ex-presidents, TV stars, Movie Stars in fact just about anybody who wasn't a true Stones fan was there resulting in a lack of atmosphere for a Rock 'n' Roll concert Reason 2: Mediocre performance by the guys themselves. Not earthshaking either are a few clips of early Stones interviews, though it's inevitable to show the one where Dick Cavett asks Mick at 24 if he can imagine doing concerts when he's sixty, and he replies, "" Yeah, easily. It doesn't add too much to have footage showing Marty's control freak nerves before the shoot (he could never accept that he didn't know exactly what songs were coming and in what order), nor is it hugely exciting to have Bill and Hillary present, though they have to be, because there they were, and Bill said a few words to the crowd before the concert began. Shine a Light doesn't break any new cinematic ground, even though it has cameras almost everywhere in a concert hall to capture every aspect and angle of the performing stage. It's simply awesome that all these songs can still come across so intensely and musically; but that's what being great performers and the greatest rock and roll band is about."
6645,"Like many Apatow productions, Segel penned the script and takes over as lead Peter Bretter, proving yet again that with this crew the writer is best suited for the leading role. Kristen Bell plays Sarah Marshall, the iconic ex of the film, but her role sits on the back burner along with the truly hilarious Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) to make way for a leading role in Mila Kunis. An amusing and sometimes awkward breakup film, this pic was written by and stars a long - time Apatow cohort, Jason Segel. The casting and comedic pacing was done very well and though it may not be a cinematic heavy hitter, it was very good for a directing debut and it was what movies all strive to be, entertaining. The entire Judd Apatow crew has overall had about 4 or five great comedies in the last 3 years, putting them up with all the other great comedy film makers since 2005."
6868,"But when Leonard meets Michelle (Gwyneth Paltrow), his neighbor across the courtyard, he soon becomes smitten with the fun, enticing blonde. Soon thereafter, Leonard stumbles into Michelle (Paltrow), an energetic blonde who moves into an apartment on the floor above. As both relationships progress and provide further complications (Michelle's other involvements, the business opportunities a life with Sandra will provide) a simply put but tremendously complex question is posed: do you choose the one you love or the one who loves you? 4 - months into living back home with his anxious parents (played by Moni Moshonov and Isabella Rossellini) and helping out at his father's dry - cleaning business, Leonard is introduced to Sandra (Vinessa Shaw), a sweet daughter of his father's business friend. Paltrow chasing her dream, Shaw getting what she wants and Phoenix taking a shot at life."
6930,"It's filmed in some of the most beautiful places in the world and captures them blandly. It's got one of the most interesting heroines in years that it ultimately leaves to the side, unaware of how to use her. It's constantly suggesting great artists (Melville, Dostoevsky) and it's opening act - a Ricky Jay - narrated history of the Brothers Bloom's humble beginnings - promises greatness. Ruffalo's the head and likes it that way and Brody's the heart and wants out, wants to find happiness somewhere else, in the "" unwritten life . "" Ruffalo sets up One Last Job for the two of them, and the mark is Rachel Weisz (the heroine), a reclusive millionaire and collector of hobbies."
8416,"It is the story of studio musicians who did most of the playing for the recordings of some of the great groups of this time period. And the fact that Tedesco got the clearances which gave him the rights to include the music in the film is a tribute to the industry's love and respect for these musicians. Or, thankfully, it had the potential to be what it is: ninety - five thoroughly enjoyable minutes of getting acquainted with people you thought you knew, but were actually others who you may have never heard of. If you are an aficionado of music between the 50s and late 80s early 90s you will find this a fascinating documentary. This film instantly becomes one of four documentaries highly recommended for those who want to better understand the music biz."
8408,"What it comes down to is this: Carlin is to dirty, witty, cautionary stand - up comedy what Yoda is to Jedis everywhere, which is a small spark of hope via crystal clear wisdom in a world where it's pretty damn hard to get any. The material, even if sounding at times a tinge of the previously done (i. e. the whole bit on children in school and camp like the Children segment in Diseased), is always fresh and with such a sting of truth to everything that it scalds the mind while (here goes) tickling the funny bone. The comeback is partially successful with It's Bad for Ya! At 70 Carlin bounces back from the level of despair (and some of the stumbles in the act itself) from Life is Worth Losing to a special that is firmly structured but loose and playful - or as much as the "" old f *** "" can get - and is continuously, ceaselessly, funny. This is better than his previous specials, yet far from Jammin' in New York."
6660,"Iron Man is a spectacular and funny popcorn ride that not only has great action scenes, but also some great actors. Billionaire and genius Tony Stark â€“ with a personality vaguely based on Howard Hughes â€“ is a weapons inventor that gets captured by bad guys in Afghanistan. As great as everything looked, what really drives the movie is the emotional resonance and down to earth nature of the plot. Needless to say, Robert Downey Jr. and company deliver the goods. The Spider - Man and the X-Men movies did this to a degree but only as far as their respective studios wished to stay true to the source material."
6798,"The production value here looks as good as many Hollywood movies, and the "" monster "" is done particularly well. It's a fun way to spend 80 minutes. The plot is simple enough: a fungus like entity is infecting anything alive and uses their bodies in very innovative ways to get to move bodies. Characters are interesting and intelligent people that use their wits and brains to try to save their lives and don't just scream and panic. This movie is stuck somewhere between a theatrical release - quality film and a direct to DVD movie, but much better than your ordinary Sci - Fi channel special."
6652,"Poppy is presented as both relentlessly cheery and, on another level, remarkably intuitive; throughout the film, she has a series of encounters with troubled male figures (a boy in her class who has started bullying, a very strange homeless Irishman and, above all, her phenomenally uptight driving instructor Scott) and in all of them, Poppy's liveliness and friendly curiosity about other people is seen to be a powerful counter to male self - pity, anger and despair. Her flatmate Zoe (Alexis Zegerman, very good) is a wonderfully dry and sarky counter to Poppy's enthusiasm, although the affection between them is palpable. Happy - Go - Lucky is a highly enjoyable and often very funny film, but it also carries terrible sadness. Thankfully, there's no beret but there are plenty of knockabout gags which, when coupled with Poppy's infectious giggling and quick asides, had the audience laughing along quite genuinely. Even the two dimensional characters have good aspects for which they are easily forgiven."
6709,"A lifelong French citizen and a member of the AcadÃ©mie des Beaux Arts, he is part of the cultural establishment there, and he has received frequent European awards. He was offered the option to return to complete the trial with the same lawyers and a new judge and the promise of no sentence ten years ago, but ironically that judge insisted the proceedings be televised, so Polanski refused. He is the consummate "" filmmaker's director "", and has made many excellent films--some of the most important films ever created--for over 40 years. That said, Ms. Zenovich is a talented filmmaker. This becomes the pursued theme of Marina Zenovich's documentary feature Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired, an above average film that is more informative than entertaining."
6663,"Of course, the movie has (very small, almost invisible) drawbacks, like some lines in a wrong language (english instead of french) and some Rambo - stuff, but the overall impression is simple: a strong recommendation! Niam's character Bryan ("" B "" letter too) beats up baddies way better and he looks more scary and real somehow than those other pansy agents. The artwork and direction is nicely done, giving you the feeling of being the one attacking and the chair squirming feeling of being the poor gits who get annihilated in almost every way possible. Neeson seems a bit pityful at the start, but soon overturns that impression with a taste of his handywork after around ten minutes of the thriller. And enjoy this ninety - minutes show."
6719,"It's really nice to stumble upon good movies when you don't expect it. Felon is a movie about a man who is working hard to create a life for himself and his family, he has worked hard to establish his own business and feels as though he is finally ready to start reaping the fruits of his labour. The story is very well told and by the end of the movie, you are left reflecting on how the correctional system has so many flaws and how it drives people to become their worst, both as inmates and as guards. However, the film also shows that even in these circumstances, there are great acts of humanity and compassion. The movie delivers a very diverse emotional palette, with tear breaking scenes all the way to explicit hardcore violence thanks to incredible acting by Dorff, Kilmer and Perrineau, truly bringing their characters to life."
6585,"Jane (Katherine Heigl) is the people - pleaser of the century. A somewhat spineless nice girl who can't say no to anyone, she has been a bridesmaid 27 times, often exceeding her duties in every wedding. Under the pretense of covering George and Tess's wedding, he really is writing about Jane and her perpetual bridesmaid stints. 27 Dresses wraps up all the plot lines in one neat sequence that is a truly worthy finale. Heigl's acting is mostly good barring a few scenes in which she has the look of a person just recovered from a coma and her expressions are left to the audience's imagination."
6797,"On the other hand, Cantet captures the real classroom dynamic. But as the film jumps forward to the end of the year, good feelings seem to have returned and the teacher gives out copies to the students of a booklet he's had made of all their "" self - portraits "" with photographic illustrations, which is well received. Up to 7 or 8 takes were used to hone a segment, but according to Cantet, the young actors got back into the spirit of things so successfully that they could be intercut seamlessly. And since blends of documentary and narrative often represent the cutting edge today, Cantet's achievement seems a very up - to - date one. A junior high school French teacher discovers this the hard way in Laurent Cantet's The Class, a work based on the autobiographical novel "" Entre Le Murs "" ("" Between the Walls "") by teacher FranÃ§ois BÃ©gaudeau, who plays the teacher Francois Marin in the film."
6795,"The story is recycled, but it's still a lot fun to watch and has some really fun scenes. Rachel, the land scaper, Sam, and his dog, Pepi who is also in love with Chloe, are on the hunt to find her and get her home safe and sound. Plenty of action, laughs, and occasional tears."
6640,"But the volunteers of this midwife to be filmed were not excluded if there is a problem; one of the births requires transfer so you see how that is handled as well. The film educates people about the history of birth in this country, how things are done in other countries including Europe, and shows statistics about birth (there are more than they include in the medical literature) that will probably surprise a lot of people. Giving women more choice in their ideal birthing experience spares them from being surprised by the reality of hospital births. It is inspirational to women and partners and allows them to view different births including the preparation. Everyone in America should watch this film, especially fathers and mothers - to - be."
6714,"The instant strength of this film that comes to mind is the great use of the 3D technology. It has plenty of surprises, and it doesn't over do it at all. He's blossomed into a great young actor, after a stunning turn in Bridge to Terabithia, in addition to great shows in Zathura and Little Manhattan. Seth Meyers (yes, THAT Seth Meyers) provides some laughs at the beginning and end of the film. Fraser and Hutcherson in particular worked well as uncle and nephew."
6711,"The crowd especially responded well to Meryl and her two cronies (arguably the strongholds of the movie). Equally brilliant was the way the extras (usually some Greek old women) were deployed throughout the movie. "" Mama Mia "" is a guilty pleasure, (no self - respecting cineaste should ever admit to even liking this movie, never mind loving it), but as guilty pleasures go, this is the best junk meal you are ever likely to have. Most of these songs sound as if they were written for the film and not the other way round; in other words, they fit the plot in the way that songs in a good musical should and they are good enough to stand on their own. Armed with irresistible hooks, soaring melodies and near - celestial vocal stylings, the Swedish pop group ABBA churned out a body of insanely catchy and superbly crafted tunes - "" Waterloo, "" "" SOS, "" "" Fernando, "" "" Dancing Queen, "" "" The Winner Takes it All, "" etc. - that made it the world's top - selling musical act of the 1970's and early 1980's."
7086,"What saves this heavy talk is a soulful innocent who's connected, or' branchÃ©,' as the French say--in the most literal sense: he gets fitted with electronic "" nodes "" all along his arms, neck, and back, so he can be plugged to a central computer in at the border and thereby help America to achieve its fondest dream: making others do all the menial physical work, but without allowing them to enter the country. Memo (Luis Fernando PeÃ±a), Sleep Dealer's young hero, comes to the "" Sleep Dealers "" in a mixture of desperation and hope, to save what's left of his little family in a rural village in Oaxaca. Because the Hispanic - oriented distributor Maya is buying the film and may finance a substantial stateside theatrical release, Rivera was saying in December, it may have a better fate than the mere straight - to - DVD issue Justin Chang of' Variety' predicted. The actor makes a sympathetic little man hero in the classic picaresque mold, and the film's story dramatizes its theme of how immigrants are at once exploited and excluded in a way that's not only full of vividness and irony, but trippy. Luis Fernando PeÃ±a was a real good choice for the main role, even if it wasn't a very challenging one."
6808,"For an animated film, it has exactly what you want: fantastic colors and colorful characters - most of them very funny and entertaining to view and hear - and a good story with some interesting twists to it. But the premise was nicely original, and the actors put in some good performances. If you enjoy the famous Frankstein monster story, or wild characters in a monster - lab - type setting, you should enjoy this parody. It's an underrated film and looks super on DVD. Actually, all the leading voices - Buscemi, John Cusack, Molly Shannon, Sean Hayes, John Cleese, Jay Leno and more were all great."
6591,"Of course people will be watching this movie for the visceral pleasure and Colverfield delivers. Great job J. J. Abrams and company! The filmmakers came up with some really great creature designs that were menacing yet very much original. If you're bound to be upset over seeing a movie with a lack of music, then stay for the credits, during which a fantastic suite of music composed by Michael Giacchino titled "" Roar! All in all, a fantastic time at the movies."
6826,"The portrayal of the relationship of the sisters is well done while the development of the relationship between Scott - Thomas and Greville is beautifully drawn - in a way that only French directors manage; the smallest gestures having deep meaning. This movie succeeds in presenting believable characters through life - like dialogs and superior acting. It is a French film, and one has to accept the parameters of French' intimisme'; as such it is wonderful. There was a curiously fugitive quality to KST's interviews about this film: one got the impression she didn't really want to talk about it in more than mundane depth. The cast is evenly excellent with Kristin Scott Thomas and Elsa Zylberstein the personifications of things felt and not said to siblings."
6653,"But none of those politicians really believed things like every word of the Bible being literal. When people with beliefs like that are given power, the inevitable result is destruction, and that is the point that this admittedly at times hilarious film hammers in during the final 5 minutes. Not just a propaganda piece, and more accessible than most of Bill Maher's creative output, Religulous still preaches to the choir (please excuse this phrase). While this film is not as funny as Borat, Religulous (which, at times is actually pretty scary) is a more powerful film because this film is true. Like the pro-creationist movie "" Expelled "", Religulous cuts to a variety of old film stock when making jokes."
6727,"PenÃ©lope Cruz was wonderful, vibrate and funny especially when doing the Spanish. A career - best performance from Scarlett Johansson, a wickedly entertaining turn from Penelope Cruz, and the absolute revelation that is Rebecca Hall form a great cast along with Javier Bardem in a role that may surprise the majority of the American public (well, for most of the movie, anyway). All you should know is that Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) go to Barcelona for the summer and things get complicated when they meet a charming, mysterious, and rich painter (Javier Bardem) and he makes a rather upfront proposition to both of them. It's best if you know nothing of how Cruz' character impacts the film prior to watching it. What follows is a free - flowing rectangle of romance with any combination of Bardem, Vicky, Cristina, and Bardem's unmanageably volatile ex-wife Penelope Cruz, who deserves an Oscar nomination for her work here."
6807,"And while it focuses on the husband changing his ways in order to win back his wife, it also touches on wives changing their ways to win back their husbands. A few good laughs are sprinkled in for good measure."
8112,
6940,""" L'heure d'ete "" is a fine movie written and directed by Oliver Assayas. Beautiful acting by Binoche, Charles Berling, Edith Scob and wonderful directing and writing by Assayas. And the impulse behind the film was something trivial and occasional, a request from the MusÃ©e d'Orsay to do something, as they'd asked Hou Hsiau - hsien (the result was Hou's' Flight of the Red Balloon'). This is one of Oliver Assayas' most heartfelt movies. The' Heure d'Ã©tÃ©' (summer hour), is a moment when adult siblings Adrienne (Juliette Binoche, the star of Hou's' Balloon,' though including her again was not a d'Orsay requirement), FrÃ©dÃ©ric (Charles Berling, his third time in an Assayas film, and a kind of alter ego here), and JÃ©rÃ©mie (JÃ©rÃ©mie Renier) with parts of their families, have come to the family's beautiful country place to celebrate the 75th birthday of their mother HÃ©lÃ¨ne (Edith Scob)."
6806,"You don't often sit in a BAFTA screening and hear weeping behind you but even the most hardened cineaste would be moved by this look at the holocaust through an Aryan child's eyes. Set during World War II, a story seen through the innocent eyes of Bruno, the eight - year - old son of the commandant at a concentration camp, whose forbidden friendship with a Jewish boy on the other side of the camp fence."
6881,"This wonderfully acted and written great movie speaks to people who lived or know those years close, who have an idea of the period called "" first republic "", the years of the Cold War and terrorism in Italy. Splendidly put together but only with the intellect so, for non Italians a puzzle that seems like a figment of someone's imagination and to be taken as a sort of intellectual metaphor. A masterful achievement without concessions to the larger public who doesn't know or care about Italian politics. This gives the picture the greatness of a Greek tragedy, combined with the fiery spirit of politically charged movies like, say, Oliver Stone's body of work. Non-Italians like Mafia movies; Italians are sick of them, and might have wished for patriotic reasons that their best filmmakers had won applause by turning to some other subject matter."
6793,"It was very funny seeing Sam in corn rows and with the gray in them. If it wasn't for all the problems it had, this movie would have done much better than it did and it is without a doubt, worth watching. Samuel keep on making these wonderful movies. During credits they run extended outtakes and an interview with Mac and it is handled with love and respect and it took the potentially creepy feeling of "" their last appearance "" away. Thankfully, he has a great co-lead to work off of, as Samuel L. Jackson, too, has a really adept comic timing and way of bending around the script when it can work best."
6597,"The fact that the story gives him such amazing capability to the point that you occasionally start rolling your eyes should in no way deter from his acting. Burke and Lane, as rival investigators, develop an interesting chemistry that builds through the film and is never compromised. Untraceable was a suspenseful thriller with great action, fun death strategies, and wonderful acting, that has a ridiculous amount of unappreciative reviews and hate aimed at it in all the areas that a lot of people have no problems with in other movies. Lane gives a fine performance as a serious investigative agent, and yet no matter how grisly that many scenes are the theme of net crime and hacking overpowers and gives a strong message of awareness even over the well liked and popcorn moments of torture and nasty horror. Director Gregory Hoblit's pacing is much better than his direction of Ms. Lane; Anastos Michos's cinematography is spot on for a dreary, menacing Portland."
8078,"all of em were engaging and believable, and Jamie Winstone obviously inherited some skills from her dad, she rules her scenes. The use of the Big Brother house is very inspired, and depending on how you look at it, the fact that the contestants are the only people who are truly safe just adds to the depressing nature of the series. Of the show's contestants, Joplin is the most memorable. At about 140 minutes complete with "" previously on "" intros, this feels like one big zombie epic. Firstly the acting is great from Andy Nyman (severance) as the totally obnoxious producer of Big Brother Patrick to Jamie Winstone as the poor floor runner Kelly forced to become the heroine in charge of the survival of the house - mates of the Big Brother house."
7693,"Everything, yes, absolutely EVERYTHING in SK2 is derivative--and NOTHING is done nearly as well as it's been done in previous sword and sorcery epics."
6882,"Influences aside, the ingenuity in crafting the action scenes in this film makes it a joy to watch. There are some good parts of the movie. The sets and props really added to the movie's visual appeal. All three actors were pretty good in their roles, and Jung Woo - Sung looked ridiculously good looking, but Lee really shined in his new "" change of role "". There was a strength in his eyes that almost literally jumped off the screen, and his character was chillingly convincing."
6792,"The three leads do a pretty good job, Lance being a particularly funny character. Not only because it shows the lifestyle everybody would have loved to live in its teenage years, it also features both laughs and unexpected developments in the end, thoughts about the meaning of love and how important it is to trust feelings. As a result, Sex Drive will undoubtedly speak a lot clearer to younger audience members than their older counterparts, but if you happen to be a part of that demographic, then there is definitely some great laughs to be had here; unabashedly immature and not afraid to get dirty, Sex Drive is a long ride, but it's worth it in the end for the fun that it expels over that trip. The climax got really over-the-top, but it did continue on with the laughs, and was satisfying. It is easily one of the funniest movies of 2008."
6827,"Italian director Gabriele Muccino brilliantly pieces together a tragic modern day Shakespearian love story, weaving between the present day and glimpses into the dark past. Everything culminates in this magnificent ending that will make you want to tell everyone you meet to go see this movie now. This movie will touch your heart in places you never knew existed. Seven Pounds is a wonderful movie that will stay with you long into the night and next day. and the acting and performances were nuanced, layered and authentic."
6884,"If you have none than "" Far Cry "" will surprise you. The second strong element are the action scenes which are actually pretty decent and fun to watch. The dialogue could be better and there's not much in the way of character development or anything but it has solid action through and through. It is still not good but it is at least watchable which is an improvement over the bloodrayne. Most of the actors are pretty good but you can tell they aren't taking it seriously based on comparisons with other performances."
7107,"As most of the early scenes of rising dread come from their characters listening to others calling the radio show, their reactions are essential to maintaining suspense and they do a fantastic job. It's a movie that defies expectations and provides a refreshing injection into a genre of movie that has become increasingly tired as of late. And if you work for Comcast, please put this movie on OnDemand! Between reports of school closings and traffic reports, Mazzy tries to provoke (wake up) his audience with charged language but Mazzy is about to learn that words have consequences. As the bloodshed escalates and threatens Mazzy and his morning crew they slowly learn the true nature of the threat and the power of their own words."
6791,"This of course will please those looking for a continuation of the previous instalments, but it will undoubtedly feel too stagnant and jaded to interest anyone else. The good news for some is that Saw V feels natural and consistent to its recent predecessors helmed by Bousman, yet for many others this won't be something to get excited about. Saw 3 + 4 mainly rode on the fact that the traps got more and more gore filled then the original first movies. For those who attend screenings of the latest Saw movies only to watch people get their comeuppance through a series of bloody and grisly tests, then this will be where your thirst is quenched. Taking on a tone that is strikingly similar to instalment two, the challenges presented here are graphic and extremely cerebral, shot in the same berserk ways so far explored in the series (although, the blending scene segment style incorporated in IV is gone) which add to the movie's intense ability to draw you in."
6886,"Neil Patrick Harris is absolutely inspired as the not so horrible, Dr. Horrible. Well, yes, and then again, Mr. Whedon can't leave anything as simply fun. In classic fashion, it is over-cocky hero Captain Hammer (Nathan Fillion who worked with Whedon on "" Firefly "") who seems to always interfere with both of Dr. Horrible's objectives: being evil and Penny. If you are a Whedon fan, you'll enjoy this little gem. Joss Whedon's sense of humor is playful, crude, warped, and everything one might love from a skewering of superheroes."
6828,"Randy "" The Ram "" Robinson, played brilliantly by Mickey Rourke, was a star professional wrestler in the 1980s. He had a legendary pay - per - view match against the Ayatollah in his prime, his own Nintendo game, posters, "" Best of The Ram "" VHS series and legions of fans who worshipped him. He has a good physique for his age - with the aid of steroids and tanning salons - he still has good friends in the local wrestling brotherhood and he enjoys hanging out with Cassidy (played by Marisa Tomei) at the strip club where she works. She also knows that her career is coming to an end, but unlike The Ram she seems to have plans after she retires, and her finances are in good order. The wrestling scenes were also amazingly crafted and you can see Randy build off the crowd's excitement."
6786,"Director David Wain knows how to keep the film from being unbearably crude and unwatchable by proving other ways to deliver laughs: whether it is with physical humor, snappy comebacks, and hilarious scenarios. Directed by David Wain, maker of The Ten (funny cult film), and written by Wain and Paul Rudd, this film is hilarious. The scenes with him and Mintz - Plasse are watchable. The important thing is the laughs, and this is where the film delivers. One of the films defining elements is the showcasing of role - playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons (here it is known as L. A. I. R. E)."
6785,"This film is about James Bond cracking down a multi-national corporation that works with dictators to get a share of precious natural resources. Mention should be made of Judi Dench - she delivers another excellent performance as M. Would heartily recommend watching Casino Royale on DVD beforehand if you own it, specifically to prepare and remind yourself of the odd plot point as they certainly will be relevant here. One of their scenes, alternately surprisingly tender and genuinely shockingly callous, is easily one of the very finest moments in the entire history of the series. There are some beautiful locations though, especially in Italy and the Aston looks great, for a little while!"
6830,"Everything was top notch from the elegant directing to the subtly wonderful performances down to the magical score. This visually and emotionally rich movie recalls the life of a very peculiar man born in the early 20th century who ages backwards. He spends a lifetime trying to understand how his love for Daisy works and still only gets a few incredible years really loving her. His nuances are spot on and despite the heavy use of make - up and CGI used to portray his character, it is Pitt who makes Benjamin that much more curious. Yes, it's slow, especially by today's movie standards, but it's certainly a unique story and it's nicely filmed, acted and directed."
6831,"Carrey is back in form with "" Yes Man "". What made this film so great was the natural charm of Zooey Deschanel. Yes Man is an excellent feel - good comedy with an outstanding turn from Jim Carrey, Zooey Deschanel & Terence Stamp. Despite the oral sex scene Yes Man is Jim Carrey's most romantic movie in a long while. Bradley Cooper â€“ Carrey best friend in the movie - is a handsome man with some great screen presence."
6790,"Unrealistic moments and scenes are embedded throughout the movie, Camp Rock sitting at the top of them all. Lindsay Lohan, Hilary Duff and Shia LaBeouf have left Disney. So that Mitchell will be popular, she gets herself into a bundle of lies that her mother is president of Hot Tunes in China, etc. . The songs are all catchy and entertaining and unlike the unpredictability of a musical, when the characters sings: It makes complete sense. Sure, the Jonas Brothers added to the musical value and it had a few great songs in the end but the sound editing made it sound like the performers were lipsynching (who knows, some might've been)."
6598,"The story is simple but solid, and works on several levels. The action scenes are unparalleled, more intense than "" Black Hawk Down "", "" Saving Private Ryan "" and "" Stalingrad "" put together. This is a Rambo who has come to terms with who and what he is, in a movie that holds up when compared with the original "" First Blood "". Stallone slips back into the role with ease and his supporting players do an admirable job. The battles were glorious even if the film has flaws, but it focuses on the battle as it should, and achieves glorious cinematic victory."
6697,"The action scenes, while entertaining and original, were not long enough to engage the audience like say, The Incredible Hulk, nor were they as jaw dropping as those in Wanted. Jason Bateman, who seems to be the bridge connecting the performances of Smith and Theron, is great as usual, and likable, marking a change from his recent turn in "" Juno "". Go see Hancock because it's DIFFERENT from the mega-budget movies that come straight from the comic book pages complete with a witty Stan Lee cameo. It's Smith's charisma, charm, and unwavering likability that ultimately save the film."
6720,"It gives you hilarious jokes, stupidly funny scenes, it's one of those comedy's that so so often tries to catch you off guard and every time it absolutely nails it! The two stars pulverizing a playground full of eleven - year - olds is also, you guessed it, not funny. Eventually, the father, a revered and important physician played by Richard Jenkins, becomes so enraged by the overgrown adolescents' antics, that he delivers an ultimatum to them. Another Will Farrell / John C. Reilly film sure sounded great--even if it didn't match the quality or laughs of this earlier film. As a result there are no lulls as even when the two stars begin to see how they must shape up and become adults for once, the awkwardness brings the laughs as well."
6787,"is a three - way with Michel Gondry, Leos Carax, and Joon - ho Bong, re-inventing Japans great city as modern fairy tales. Three fantasies of alienation, form into the most unique, original, and entertaining film of the year so far. Shades of "" The Bedsitting Room "" can be found here, but Gondry's trademark visual style is in full effect, featuring some amazing special effects, and fun set designs. Needless to say he becomes an overnight celebrity (in Japan Sada Abe became a celebrity after murdering and removing the genitals of her lover, she played herself in plays about her life after she got out of prison, and this was before WW1. Its easy to point to terrorism and racism as the grand theme here, "" he's linked to Al Queda and the Aum Cult "", etc, but misanthropy in general works just as well, and is in keeping with the alienation that courses through all of the stories."
6599,"Most of the gags in the film have been seen time and time again and by the end the audience was really switching off and the younger members of the audience just started throwing popcorn around as it was so bad. Top Secret The Naked Gun The Naked Gun 2Â 1/2 Hot Shots Hot Shots: Part Deux Kentucky Fried Movie (yes, its "" old "" but a classic none the less) Mafia! BASEketball Scary Movie 3 Sacry Movie 4 Not all of these are great. Some are downright "" average "" spoof movies, at best."
7122,"Much like the Pixar movies, it's a piece of computer animated art that could only be possible in today's world. The blue, bunny - like mini-dragon steels the show and has easily some of the funniest moments of the movie, he is already an instant classic, much as Scrat from Ice Age. Photo - realistic moments of non-existent landscapes make you put aside the fantasy of make - belief, and it's easy to be in awe of the landscape which goes beyond the usual three - suns and a kaleidoscope of flying thingamajigs (here's having at you George!) The monsters are also fully realised and wonderful to watch in action. The overall design, atmosphere, the beautiful landscapes."
6890,"tony ja's love for elephants is obvious (Thailand's national animal). The movie shows tony ja's wish to cover the major martial art skills such as Chinese kung fu, Japanese Samurai, Ninja, Muay Thai, Drunken kungfu etc., The fight sequences are brilliant, rough and the art of Drunken fighting is shown perfectly as you will see the real essence unlike that of older movies which have portrayed it as a funny martial art. "" Ong Bak 2 "" is a good epic, with a non-original storyline but a magnificent choreography of fights and art direction. Many of the non-action scenes are riveting and interesting to watch, which is something one cannot say about "" Ong Bak "" or even the brilliant "" Tom Yum Goong "" for that matter (which successfully used an absurd quantity of superbly executed action sequences to overpower any and all deficiencies that nest in - between the beatings). The fighting scenes were more then awesome, that was something new, something that you didn't see every day."
7125,"Whether or not crime is the best motif for movie and this movie successfully hold the breath of viewers. Very brave choices and a great script. It's a comedy of errors in the way the police and politicians are portrayed; a melodrama with its inclusion of the precocious little girl who belongs to the woman serving as the film's primary "" chase "" and investigative point; a psychological thriller in the way the serial killer messes with the minds of the police; a mildly gory film in the way the bad guy uses a hammer and chisel; a bit of a tragedy in the way it ends. A long uphill foot chase precedes the brawl so both combatants are extremely winded when the fighting begins â€” punches don't land and there's a girly incompetence to the whole thing, which is to say, it's realistic. After finally landing a few punches that subdue his opponent momentarily, the pimp gets up and starts kicking him in disgust."
6817,"There were some very interesting ideas (the sphere - like ship, the nanobots, the Gort acronym) and the effects were top notch, however Gort (the one thing the movie had going for it) was on screen for less then 10 minutes. Klaatu certainly rocks that three - piece suit though."
6600,"The detail in the troll market is amazing and the story rings true to the Mike Mignola comics without having to lift a story arc from any one specific past issue. It was smarter, funnier, and as visually stunning as anything you can expect from either del Toro or Mignola. The sheer number and variety of fully realized monsters, with the stronger emphasis being on puppetry and make - up as opposed to an over reliance on CGI, is almost astounding in this day and age. The performances were also top notch. It's not just because the first Hellboy was so excellent, which it was, but they handled this second film with such care and pizazz, it's almost better, in ways, than the first."
6726,"The gelid landscape envelopes the desolate story but there is a human warmth devoid of sentimentality that makes "" Frozen River "" a welcome rarity. For a first time director, a superb job, The general theme is single mothers fighting for their very life. Some stretches were of the film were dragging on but still a good film. Frozen River is independent film - making at its best, both vital and timely. Courtney Hunt's dÃ©but feature, "" Frozen River "", winner of this year's Sundance's Grand Jury Prize, is as tense as a great thriller should be, and also a heartfelt, poignant drama."
6694,"Story - intricate and intelligent, fast - paced, yet deeply explanatory, complex, yet easily taken in by non-geeks. Enough references to the true comic, alternate comic, and TV show, that everyone in the sneak peek seemed to be pleased. Plus the cameo appearances by both Stan Lee and Robert Downey Jr where terrific! If you're a fan of the comics, or just of fun popcorn films you'll definitely enjoy this one. Liv Tyler is very good as Betty Ross (formally played by the tasty Jennifer Connelly) William Hurt as General Ross is impressive and makes for a worthy adversary to Bruce Banner."
6633,"Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt - work is some great dialog work. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions / technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off."
6725,"Like so many great movies that became dragged - out trilogies, the newest Mummy falls right in. Maria Bello looked goofy and miscast and the actor who plays their son makes Hayden Christensen from the Star Wars films look like an Oscar winner. Very well choreographed, especially that thrilling sword fight between Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh. Looks, talent, AND brains to avoid a celluloid crap-fest when she sees it. Jet - Li, Yeoh had good fight scenes."
6784,"And, yet, thanks of Boyle true ingenuity, he creates uplifting and even humorous moments in the slums. The end result, with the screenplay that combines the drama, comedy, and thriller genres to great effect, is both an aesthetic triumph, and unlikely as it sounds, a crowd - pleasing masterpiece. Jamal's story is a tragic and unfortunate one, but as seen through his eyes, it is still beautiful. What he achieves in "" Slumdog Millionaire "" is transcend the line between inspiration and a miracle, awakening an emotional connection to the very special element great cinema can deliver. Also, the music is brilliant, both the original score by the legendary A. R. Rahman and the excellent choices made when it comes to the pop music included in the film (though that is to be expected from a Danny Boyle film)."
6832,"People have different tastes and that's good. He did what had to be done but he could have elevated this movie like he has done to others in the past. Valkryie perfectly illustrates how the smallest of things can have the biggest impact. Like World War II itself, the full story of the July 20 plot is long and intricate and cannot be fully told in the confines of a two hour feature film. The performances from this exceptional cast are first rate."
6601,"Things look up when he meets the beautiful local woman Chloe, played by French actress ClÃ©mence PoÃ©sy--you may remember her as Fleur Delacore in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire--and scores himself a date, which also goes horribly wrong due to Ray shooting off his big mouth. From there things continue to go south as Ray and Ken get into all sorts of messes and meet strange characters, all of whom will play a part in the larger picture. Having seen the error of his ways, he feels the need to make right, even if he hides it with a lot of complaining and arguments, and that carries over to Gleason's Ken, continuing his great run with McDonagh. McDonagh has created a clever script that interweaves its small cast of characters into an intricate crime caper that mixes humor, violence and true heartfelt human emotions into a brilliant debut feature. Strong work also from Brendon Gleeson, who all will recognize from "" Gangs of New York "" and the Harry Potter series."
6782,"True, there is a link, they are all strong films, with themes that deal with pain and loss, but the stories are different, the settings require an amazing attention to detail, what they all share is a strong focus, and interestingly enough, superb performances. Her battle with the folks at LAPD is of epic proportions, and it is amazing that she held on to her goal of exposing the corruption that she encountered as she searched for her missing boy. There are moments when one is a bit exhausted from all the information the film delivers, but every moment is worth it. It is all framed with an expert hand, and it is anchored by the very powerful work by Jolie and the rest of an amazing cast that brings to life emotions such as madness, anger, pain, sorrow, and many times, disbelief that humans can be capable of such terrible actions. The musical score is a sweet melody that hints at the love and pain themes in the film, and there are some moments bound to become classic, as children tell the stories that adults might not want to face or believe."
6613,"Witless protection had some of the most ingenious and endearing moments which even the gluttonously overpriced films fail to deliver with their pricey star cast. This film nor will any film featuring Larry the Cable Guy in live action movies will ever be classics, even when he's dead, they'll be burning in the bonfires. She loves all his critters too. Better than a lot of comedies."
6605,"However, there are some incidents that will make you laugh and laugh. After a slow start, this really picks up and turns into a decent movie with gorgeous settings and lovely underwater photography and good cast chemistry. It's campy, silly, and bright, and there is nothing like a fluffy romp around the sunny islands to cure those winter blues. This movie was fun, and sweet, and everything you'd expect from this cast. Matthew McConaghey and Kate Hudson are a newly divorced couple who learn that a treasure they've been after is off the coast of Key West (thanks to Mr. Mac), and they take a cruise ship to go get it."
6781,"Well, so far "" Madagascar "" is two - for - two in the laughs department. It's another good example of the "" new "" (last 10 years) kind of animated feature film that adults can enjoy just as much as the kids. The colors and the detail are just amazing! The combination of humor, drama, family and friendship ties and romance all make this a wonderful animated movie and the 90 minutes zip by. Some hilarious scenes like the plane crash, any scene with Moto Moto and of course Mort are lovable too."
6780,"The CGI far excels the majority of former episodes, although Futurama has always enjoyed a very shiny veneer of pure' cool'. In conclusion, this is by far the best longer - addition Futurama produced to this day. Matt Groening had spawned another winner with Futurama: Bender's Game. Futurama: Bender's Game was certainly worth the viewing pleasure and with Matt Groening at the helm, you cannot miss. That twist resulted on one of the best comedies the TV has ever produced."
6779,"The gang is back for their senior year and everything is just perfect, they came up with a great idea for a musical to represent all that they're going through in this exciting year. But there is also a lot of pressure: Zack is facing a tough decision of which college to go to while Gabriella is planning on going to Yale University so far away from him, Sharpay and her brother, Ryan, are competing for a scholarship to Juliard, and Chad and Taylor are learning what to do with the rest of their lives while loosing their best friends to different schools. It had fun songs, cute characters, silly situations, but great dance numbers and is just over all a nice film for the family. The dance sequences are much more complex, the songs are much more well performed. It must also be said that several of the musical numbers are not as fun as they should have been."
7145,"The U. S. is dominant at the world box office for animated films, with Pixar at the top of the top of that particular food chain. First, the Iranian filmmaker working in France, Marjane Satrapi made the superlative PERSEPOLIS--and, with this past week's events, it's worth revisiting for it shows some of the seeds of rebellion that has lead to the protest marches. 99 is a well done claymation feature which weaves some short stories by writer Etgar Keret into an entertaining composite story centering around an "" angel "" and how he interacts with the inhabitants of unnamed small city. Don't expect a strict narrative and some of its best moments are just that - moments in time. Best to let its brief 78 minutes just wash over you."
6691,"With the feel of a good indie flick and a strong leading man, Chaos Theory is one of those rare, genuine explorations of the human condition. Frank Allen (Ryan Reynolds), an obsessively organized efficiency expert and top - selling author, has spent his entire life planning out every little detail and following the lists and schedules he makes for himself. He clings to controlling everything because it brings order, which gives him a sense of comfort and peace of mind. The movie has its share of funny parts, but it really shines in its dramatic moments - when it's serious and honest. It effectively deals with things like relationships, truth, friendship and forgiveness, and it all feels true to how real people would react."
7721,"What makes this simple premise shine is the clever slapstick gags, great characters and the overall sweet tone throughout the film. This is a wonderful homage / recreation of the kinds of shorts kids used to go ape over back in the 1940s. Then it thrusts into the situation with total glee: a magician is having trouble with his rabbit for a very simple reason - the rabbit wants its carrot NOW, and won't get it. While it's ingenious and clever and all that and a bag of carrots, it's also a good mini-homage to the spirit of Looney Tunes shorts. Its sweetness is quintessential Disney stuff though, and its a great little addition at the start of WALL * E. Don't miss it!"
6778,"Guy's unique European gangster movies know how to have fun. Well done Ritchie, well done cast, Im up for the Real RocknRolla and when you see it so will you! The cast is amazing, Gerard Butler gives a formidable performance, Thandie Newton also very good, Tom Wilkinson flawless as always and the secondary roles from Toby Kebbell (Johnny Quid), Idris Elba (Mumbles) and Mark Strong (Archie) gave the movie a very good support. A film about a Russian mobster orchestrates a crooked land deal, millions of dollars are up for grabs, and all of London? Guy Ritchie's career has run red hot and ice cold over the yrs."
6776,"Family, honor, corruption, right and wrong, fathers and sons--these are the kinds of issues that director / co-writer Gavin O'Connor is taking on in "" Pride and Glory, "" and in doing so he's made a timeless film. In other words, there comes a moment in which the use of that word stops being realistic for becoming in the version of "" New York reality "" from co-screenwriters Joe Carnahan and Gavin O'Connor (who was also the director). Colin Farrell, Edward Norton, Noah Emmerich, and Jon Voight all deliver great performances. Voight is believable and realistic as the patriarch of the family of cops and the chief, trying to keep his family in order as he thinks it should be. The result is a forgettable movie and a hint of buyer's remorse; if you're a big enough fan of Ed Norton or Colin Farrell and want to see either of them put on a great performance, catch the matinÃ©e, or even still, wait a few months and rent it."
6774,"It was better than the remakes of Shutter, The Eye and One Missed Call, that's for sure. Manuela Velaso was better in Rec, but Jennifer did a really good job. Drew and John Dowdle are rather new to the business, and not only have they remade a film that is less than a year old, but the direction and writing just wasn't there. ' Rec' does a much better job, particularly when the reporter interviews each of the buildings residents. On this particular night, Angela and her cameraman Scott (Steve Harris) are doing a ride - along with the firemen of a local station in L. A., including Jake (Jay Hernandez) and Fletcher (Jonathan Schaech)."
6773,"Her smart timing and in particular her reactions to situations create that comedy feeling that was an essential factor to making the narrative work. 2 - Boy meets girl, awww they're getting together, OH NO SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENED, oh, phew! The lead character was portrayed well by Georgia Groome, who showed Georgia's many different sides from a self - obsessed drama queen to a caring and insightful young woman."
7153,"He is both moving and convincing (interesting since Levi is not of any Pakastani or South Asian decent). The interesting thing is that people were actually clapping at many parts. In many ways it also portrays typical family values of Americans across the country. Actually, the same can be said for all the leads, Fran Kranz, Bonnie Sommerville, Brian George and Kathy Baker - all did wonderful work. But perhaps most impressive is that Shades of Ray is writer / director Jaffar Mahmood's first full length film to direct."
6892,"Mary Lynn Rajskub is just plain fascinating as the lonely lady Blunt thinks she is helping. Many of the subplots are left open, but not in a unsatisfying way and while featuring ups and downs along the way, Sunshine Cleaning manages to find a hopeful tone without being sticky sweet. While it's easy to sing the praises of Adams, and she's never been more endearing or relatable than here, Emily Blunt proves to be an excellent foil. Something about her girl - next - door good looks combined with her innate talents as a comedienne and her theatrical background that produces some of the best facial expressions and crying - on - cue you'll ever see make her the perfect choice for this type of role. The combination of an interesting set - up, smart writing, likable characters and winning performances make the film, even when it teeter - totters from dark to sappy, go down smooth."
6949,"It presents two kinds of realities--the beautiful, smart, and rich that everyone craves to have (Massie Block) and the dull plain one that most people are in (Claire Lyons). Although many viewers of this teen movie will surely predict the outcome, it provides enough laughs and drama to please most of the young girls the film is aimed at. As with many book to film adaptations, there will always be (probably rightly) those who prefer the book to the movie. The Clique is definitely worth the 87 minutes it lasts."
6681,"It is just a litany of arguments against the arguments against steroids (intentional double negative there). This film takes an honest view at steroids, and more importantly at the attitudes that push people towards altering "" what god gave them "". When Chris quietly challenges some of the assertions of anti-steroid campaigners, notably Congressman Henry Waxman, it is done with respect and genuine interest in the factual basis for some of the widely - held beliefs about steroids. Chris explores both sides of the argument over steroids and does his best to leave the final decision of whether or not steroids have been overly vilified up to the audience. What is also very interesting about "" Bigger, Stronger, Faster "" is that the persons interviewed on both sides of the steroid question are not exactly portrayed as "" normal . """
7454,"Louis C. K. simply takes the subjects that NO one else will talk about, and makes them into funny situations to get a little light on the subject. So if this is your idea of "" great comedy "", then by all means sit down underneath this sewer pipe and enjoy Louis C. K.'s performance."
6772,"The way the different children reacted and how such a seemingly innocent experiment profoundly affected their lives was incredible and horrifying. Vogel gives a powerful performance as an idealistic teacher who isn't aware of the influence he has on others. The movie takes a lesson in human psychology and shows how it is possible for a person with oratory skills and confidence to start a movement that turns into a revolution with frightening possibilities. Putting it mildly, the movie deals with a classroom experiment about autocracy which has interesting positive and negative consequences. Die Welle (The Wave) is truly a brilliant tale that lures viewers into its cleverly developed plot just as Herr Wenger lures his unsuspecting students into a sense of fascism."
6771,"But watching it is a bracing experience, and it's encouraging to know that there are still filmmakers willing to use film as a means of challenging their audiences and picking at scabs that most people would prefer to remain solidly in place. Perhaps Jonze would have done a better job in terms of pacing and craftsmanship, but the content is still really strong. Every choice brings with it a million different consequences, some seen and others that go unnoticed."
6770,"Josh Brolin gives an excellent performance as W., and the supporting cast is generally superb, although Jeffrey Wright, Richard Dreyfuss, and James Cromwell particularly stand out. Thandie Newton is hysterically funny as Condie Rice, but it's an SNL - type parody, not an emotionally honest performance. The film ultimately plays much, much better when Stone relies on actual transcripts and information gathered by experienced reporters, and those sequences, whether they are cabinet meetings, press conferences, or more personal moments, snap and zing. To indicate that W. went to Iraq to get even for "" poppy "" and for oil was unrealistic and shows just how thin this story line really was developed. The supporting cast is a hoot, with highlights including Thandie Newton eliciting big laughs just with her facial expressions as a wicked and moronically faithful Condi Rice, Elizabeth Banks giving a winning portrayal of Laura Bush, and Richard Dreyfuss playing Cheney as the most insipid megalomaniac American politics has ever seen."
6769,""" Zack and Miri "" gets very good performances from everybody and it manages to do what a lot of romantic comedies this year have not been able to do, which is earn the laughs and earn the love of it's two characters. Of course, not only do you get heart with Rogen and Smith, but you get surefire jaw dropping jokes that will make you say, "" did they really just do that? "" Rogen is a big, doughy, lovable ball of enthusiasm and he's always fun to watch. Seth Rogen proves he can convey emotion and still be funny. In addition to being deliberately shortened on TV, Kevin Smith (Clerks, Chasing Amy) has had to fight for even the R - rating, a teaser trailer had to be removed from his website, the posters for the flick were so raunchy that the characters could only appear as stick figures (of which Seth Rogen is assuredly not), and already certain theaters have decided not to show it while openly showing Saw V and Max Payne without a moments hesitation."
6893,"To actually pay a full retail price, the same price as the "" Kung Fu Panda "" DVD, is a massive rip - off which people should be made aware of. There is a lot of positivity in "" Kung Fu Panda: Secrets of the Furious Five "". The original film, despite it's silly ending, was at least one of DreamWorks Animation's stronger films with great characters, excellent Kung Fu action sequences, a compelling story, beautiful animation, and an epic music score from Hans Zimmer and John Powell. it has some great lessons for kids, and it's kinda cute, especially the bunnies. Everything about this feature "" dumbs down "" the plot of its source material reducing the origins of these important characters to simple morality tales."
6768,"Max Payne was a game that was born of Film Noir and John Woo. What's further astounding is that the film can't even get the basics down. The great funny scenes are gone completely too, you never have to laugh at all, nothing like a gansta in a capt. baseball bat suit. It is a mystery film with some action scenes (and some very well done visual effects)."
6818,"Benicio del Toro brings a monumental performance as Che Guevara. What Soderbergh provides for an audience that will go to see it for what he will do with the project - and what Benicio Del - Toro does with the character - is that it's a history lesson made vibrant and urgent and passionate and, according to the director in interviews and Q & A's, honest portrayal of events. Producer Laura Bickford says that part two is more of a thriller, while part one is more of an action film with big battle scenes. There is lots and lots of shooting which is actually fairly sanitised (this is certainly no Saving Private Ryan), there is some mistreatment of people who are then avenged and there are lots of shots of Benicio del Toro looking quite idealistic and cool. Maybe the most refreshing thing about Che, both parts, is that its director, Steven Soderbergh, didn't know anything about Ernesto "" Che "" Guevara before taking on the project."
6721,""" Chris wrote some great episodes, but as the series ended it got weaker and weaker. Duchovny and Anderson are first - rate, as always; they are the only reason people would watch this movie; no - one else could say these lines and hold interest. The Truth Is Out There, and it is this: Any member of the audience tonight that was laughing during this movie could have sat down, and in two weeks, written a treatment that would have turned into a better movie than what Chris Carter and Spotnitz wrote. The world is a greatly changed place since the heyday of "" The X-files . "" The chemistry between Mulder (a lazy but effective David Duchovny) and Scully (an amazingly fully ranged and emotional Gillian Anderson) is still there, and Anderson's performance is especially gripping."
6717,"In short, this movie delivers what it promised: an epic SG1 adventure and a great character show. For non-fans, it's still a great experience, as it embodies what was at the heart of Stargate when it began and takes the greatest characters from its past to make a thrilling film. Indeed, Cliff Simon gives his singularly best performance of Ba'al to date, and is without a doubt the star of the show. As the conclusion to the Goa'uld arc, for pretty much any fan out there this movie is fantastic to watch. Mitchell shines throughout, indeed this seemed to be a movie made to show he well and truly belongs to SG1 outside the Ori arc, as well."
6765,"The girl in it displayed a superb acting performance the general set and costumes and well mise - en - scene in general was excellent and well worth watching just for that. Jeanne DuPrau's book is an amazing trove of metaphors (candles, the library, the seed, the Pipeworks, and the city itself). Sure enough, their roles aren't the most demanding of jobs, but despite their characters' underwritten nature both fulfil the requirements of leads nicely and with enough conviction to consistently carry the film forward. Despite being replete with a nefarious mayor and a mutated mole (like the massive moths, never explained), the story uses neither of these things enough, leaving some scenes to be propelled solely by the heroes following the by - the - numbers instructions left to them. "" City of Ember "", director Gil Kenan's follow up to his horror - lite for preteens "" Monster House "", is a fun ride that's well worth the admission price if only for the superb production design and the likable leads."
6953,"He gives very astute and detailed re-tellings of his life. But the power of Toback's film is that Tyson's vulnerability and openness balance the brutal story of triumph spoiled by hubris. Director Toback does a brilliant job in letting his subject do all the talking, and it is riveting. The interspersing of his fights with his dialogue is superbly done - credit to the the direction of James Toback. A fascinating insight into the mind of The Baddest Man on The Planet."
6764,"There are twists and turns and it's a lot of fun. There are scenes where the film gets really dark and serious, and they completely work as well. In particular, for a white American screenwriter's work, this is incredibly perceptive and understanding of how Jordanians act and feel. While the film does have some marvelous and well done action, it's few and far between, as the film is more about gathering intelligence than intelligently blowing everything up. As Ferris, Leonardo DiCaprio applies his trademark wiry energy to an intensely compelling performance that could have shown a bit more variety."
6763,"But the light shines brightest on Anne Hathaway as Kym, the ex-junkie, ex-alcoholic, ex-return rehab patient bordering on becoming an ex-family member. Audiences claim this as a breakthrough performance because they fell in love with Anne in The Princess Diaries movies, Ella Enchanted and the wonderfully wicked The Devil Wears Prada. In a movie like this, it's crucial that the audience understands the back story that led the characters to their current dynamic, and it's a minor miracle that "" Rachel Getting Married "" does that without the use of flashbacks, voice over or even extensive scenes of plot exposition. With a film more comfortable in the category of "" ensemble piece "", Rosemarie is the catalyst and pushes the energy along, changing and charging every one of her scenes. As a filmmaker who obviously enjoys making music concert films ("" Stop Making Sense "", "" Neil Young: Heart of Gold ""), there are quite a few musical performances presented in total."
6954,"This so called realistic and objective movie seems like a propaganda filled stupidity that insults both peace advocates and solders. The Iraqis are portrayed as crazy bombers and the solders are portrayed as independent thrill seekers. heard lots of good reviews beforehand. Quite easily the best movie of 2009 and the best war movie since Black Hawk Down and maybe even beyond that, The Hurt Locker does something that few other war movies seem to be able to do. The film introduces a seemingly new and unique idea by following a U. S. Army Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) team as they go around defusing potential bombs all around town â€“ a concept that allows the typical fast - action war theme to take a backseat to the dramatic intensity of the three team members' escapades and arguments."
6705,"They both deal with young men coming of age thanks to first love, but this film has such superior performances and writing. Expertly directed and stacked with some of the best hip hop of the nineties, it's a film that is hilarious, sad and moving, populated with great characters you'll enjoy spending a couple of hours with. Do yourself a favor and go see The Wackness. One newcomer is high school grad Luke Shapiro, played with urban wisdom and smooth shyness by NYC native Josh Peck, in Jonathan Levine's funky yet poignant film, "" The Wackness "". Sometimes, first loves aren't the best ones."
6657,"The movie is mostly an excuse to give Fey and Poehler the chance to riff off of one another, and they do it well. Due to their recent successes, it makes sense that SNL's comedians want to branch out into movies like they successfully did in the 90s with Wayne's World. Baby Mama is something that looks like from the Lifetime Network, but it's all good, it has some really funny moments and was just cute. It's well - deserved after her work on "" Mean Girls "" and "" 30 Rock "", and she, along with co-star and former SNL cast mate Amy Poehler, do a really nice job of anchoring this one. Most of the laughs come from Angie Ostrowiski (Amy Poehler's character), a not exactly high - class girl working for Chaffee Bicknell's (played by Sigourney Weaver) surrogacy agency that offers to be Kate's surrogate after Kate attempts and fails to get pregnant multiple times."
6804,"They completely took the humour out of all the potentially very humorous moments through the more' arty' editing, over the top score dramatic score (soundtrack definitely plays a big part of the different tone in the 3rd movie) and generally lousy script. As far as action films go it ticked all the boxes, plenty of guns, car stunts, good fights, romance and even some corny humour, and has a happy ending. The second was him inflating large flotation devices (conveniently stored his trunk), while he's deep underwater, with only the air from his tires which caused the 2 ton car to rise to the surface and still enough for him to breath on and drive the car when magically towed to shore by a good Samaritan. So, a dramatically more realistic Transporter movie but sucked dry of all the humorous and fun tone that made the previous instalments so much fun. The point of an action film is to highlight cool action scenes."
6896,"And it is without a doubt that this piece of animation is well worth every minute of your time, especially when the visuals just arrests your attention from the get go, and has some wonderful music and songs by 1920s jazz singer Annette Hanshaw, who provides the titular Sita with her singing voice. The glamour of India, the glamour of the 1920s, the depth - sounding drumbeat of the ancient mythic world, and the woman who loves the wrong kind of man â€“ Nina Paley gets them all together, along with a relevant chunk of autobiography about a disappointing husband of her own, in her dazzling first full - length animated feature. But then' Sita sings the Blues' is more than just eye catchy drawings, a narrative that holds you in place and a much contemporary way to retell the epic with the most unlikely Jazz legend for the songs! voicing three shadow like caricatures bickering and debating about the events that Ramayana is popular for and a third, sort of, platonic / musical track is the animation piece where Sita breaks into one of Hanshaw's classics every time a relevant situation presents itself. The moments and the way these songs lend themselves to the scenes are absolutely brilliant."
6898,"The better scenes (e. g. the training camp in Jordan or the lawsuit in Stammheim) are obviously those where the film catches breath, calms down and takes its time for the actors to shine. The quality of the acting ranges from good to fantastic (with very few exceptions like Alexandra Maria Lara, who is nothing more than wide - eyed again and who thankfully doesn't even have dialogue). A lot of locations, a great deal of main and supporting roles, hundreds of extras, good special effects (mainly explosions) and a set design and costume design which creates a very coherent 70's atmosphere: you can see that the film cost a lot of money. The action scenes are done splendidly, especially at the beginning the riots during the visit of the Persian Shah which culminated in the shooting of a student which in turn was, at least to some extent, the origin of the rise of terror."
7436,The customary short film on Pixar releases generally picks up a side character from the main film and does a new story with them as the focus. Produced as a DVD extra for the movie Wall - E. A welcome find on the DVD. It is charmingly delivered with the high standards of the main film and delivers several good laughs even though it is essentially one joke repeated. This DVD extra isn't trying to the sort of brilliance that distinguished Wall - E. It's jut a cute shot that tells a story that runs concurrently with some of Wall - E.
6716,"When they do land on the planet, they meet some interesting creatures and have to save the planet since one alien, Zartog, wants to take over. The animation is so - so, the voices are decent, except some moments seemed a little stereotypical and clichÃ©. Truth is, and a departure in animated movies of late, this one is sans big name stars or voice talent, and doesn't detract you away from the story, nor have one talent steal the thunder from the rest. The story at times might find itself hard pressed to throw in some wisecracks on pop culture, but there are indeed moments to have it in the movie so subtly, you'll probably blink and you miss it."
6612,"Sure it has a predictable plot and it's nothing more than a right - side - of - the - tracks / wrong - side - of - the - tracks love story (Pretty in Pink, West Side Story, Romeo & Juliet, etc.), but the dancing was really incredible. the whole point of these movies is to take your breath away with dance moves and step up 2 does just that. Everything a entertaining mainstream movie has to have. The sequel to the popular "" Step Up "" was obviously not as good as the first (sequels and prequels never really are) but it was a fun film to watch. Both Step Up movies have GREAT choice in characters because the lead roles in both films are gorgeous."
6665,"There's also one or two moments that evoke memories of the original movie from years ago and fans should get a smile out of it. The wrapped up nicely from the questions left at the end of the TV series, but still left plenty of openings for the next Stargate movie. While non-fans might want to watch the Prelude on the DVD to catch - up on all the plot lines going on in the film, fans should enjoy it. The performances were top - notch, as Stargate has consistently provided over the past decade - "" regular "" and "" guest "" characters all. The movie moved very fast and although it did seem a little forced at times it still had a few twists."
6667,"Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz have good chemistry on set, not exactly Gone with the Wind type of romance, but enough to make it feel somewhat believable and make these characters interact well with the plot. What Happens in Vegas' has not only the trappings of a big, expensive Hollywood comedy, the bright colors and nice sets, but two big glamorous stars, and they are not humiliated by being here, because they do look very good, and mismatch or not, look good together too. The absence of a high laugh level such as the Apatow comedies occasionally achieve means they get to act more like people; they can register ordinary expressions instead of mere comic mugging and you get to look at them, which is one good and durable reason for watching this movie. Yes there are 1 or 2 silly scenes but it was still funny. If you like love comedies you should see this movie, but if you are looking something more brainy."
6761,"This isn't a disaster though, because the film is still fantastic in moments and the acting and cinematography are often superb, it's just a bit too vague on the whole to really capture your attention and make you care about the story. Apart from one woman (who is murdered, naturally) who seems a decent sort of person with a criminal husband who is in jail and a twelve year - old son who has joined a rival criminal gang and is being trained as a killer, in between delivering drugs to addicts, there is no one in the film who is anything other than an evil monster."
6644,"While it's certainly not a masterpiece, The Ruins is just an instantaneous breath of fresh air. Instead of fun and excitement, however, the four are held captive at top of the ruins by the locals. Director Carter Smith, with his major movie debut, is great at ratcheting up the scares and the gore quotient as he wrings some pretty genuine performances from his cast. Most American horror movies seem to want to rush through the opening scenes, to get to the so - called scare moments, but Smith takes time with his plot, as he did with his other script, the brilliant A Simple Plan. So if you fall into that category than do yourselves and anyone who can enjoy a straight shot horror film a favor and stay away."
6760,"It's beautifully shot, really well paced and contains outstanding performances from the two female leads. This movie is inevitably going to be compared to Hostel and other movies in the horribly monickered' torture - porn' genre and that is a genuine mistake. Making its Stateside debut, Pascal Laugier's "" Martyrs "" was the grand finale to a spectacular constellation of fine horror films. "" Martyrs "" is one of the few crossover films that could play at a horror film festival, as well as a intellectually artsy festival or a gay & lesbian festival alike. Those expecting another fun, bloody, gory, insane horror flick can just up and leave, because Martyrs isn't like that."
6803,"Kristen Stewart is sort of the queen of not showing facial expressions, so she's perfect for the role of the awkward teen Bella Swann. It's not just a vampire and a human falling in love with each other, but because of the two leads, it's one of the best on screen romances of the decade. The chemistry between the two leads, romantically and sexually, is amazing. Stewart plays a great brooder, and she certainly did that here. There were some very good moments and some very "" eh "" moments."
7297,"It's not an edgy film but is light and humorous with a some touches of drama without coming across as a message movie and it has an appeal to a general audience. The story is funny, dramatic and romantic and the trio Gustaf SkarsgÃ¥rd, Torkel Petersson and Tom Ljungman is charismatic and shows a great chemistry. This is one of those rare occurrences when you attend a cinematic experience that takes you through an array of emotions. Nice cinematography from Marek Wiesner and production design from Lene Willumsen which give the film a rich textured look. The director and writer Ella Lemhagen is very sensitive and never overexploits the gay relationship of GÃ¶ran and Sven."
6759,"When you see N&N (and if you're in the mood for a lighthearted enjoyable movie, you should), don't go with an expectation of grandeur or even for the entire thing to be great. Ari Graynor's part is by far the funniest character of the bunch and Ari plays the part extremely well. And what's most important--the characters Nick and Norah act like slightly more interesting versions of normal people. Movies should be about the creation and expansion of a spark of magic--not about giving you exactly what you expect or want. The perfection of the movie lives in its imperfections."
6659,"Lots and lots of closets: big closets, small closets, mirrored closets, closets to Narnia, so many damned closets you'll not want to dress yourself for another year. Prom Night is shot with the artistic eye someone gives while finely crafting a Lifetime original film. The MOST you see is what looks like someone having taken a ketchup bottle and spraying it across a plastic sheet."
6757,"The middle was the best part, with a couple of laugh out loud moments. It had a darker humor and it was pretty heavy but there were so many very funny and unexpected moments. First of all, if you have watched a decent amount of movies, you will know that Sidney and Alison would be together at the and of the movie, one way or another. At other moments there was time allowed to share the main protagonists' (i. e. Pegg's and Dunst's) reflection on how events were affecting them and what had led them to where they now found themselves. Based on Toby Young's book about survival in American business, this comedy drama received mixed views from critiques."
6643,"As for the humans, Abigail Breslin as "" Nim Rusoe "" is a cute, likable kid. but it's a nice movie, has funny animal characters, a lead kid who is not a brat, nice island scenery, one big - name actress (Jodie Foster) and is a diversion for an hour - and - a-half. If you don't have kids, but are looking for something different from the usual movies, this is still one to consider. When Nim gets an E-Mail from famous author, Alex Rover, who she thinks is a real life hero, Alex wants answers about volcano's for her next book, but Nim wants help since she's alone on the island and her dad hasn't returned. Nim, the daughter, is very much in touch with nature and enjoys reading the tales of Alex Rover, an adventurer."
6756,"Many times the camera is moving so much and the cuts are so fast you are not really able to see the full extent of the destruction or when and what will happen next. The lighting was good on some scenes, but very much off on others. The gritty realism of the car chase sequence onto the cranes was stunning. The pacing, the tone, the emotion, the score, everything was perfect in this scene."
6675,"Shia LaBoef is actually quite good and not annoying at all, he has some funny lines and scenes. Some really good action scenes, esp. What was supposed to be funny only got howls of disbelieve and "" Yeah right "" from the audience. Should have made Indy IV 10 years earlier. The middle was alright, with some cool chase scenes, decent dialogue, and a cool jungle chase scene with vehicle to vehicle fighting."
6674,"Each character has their funny moments and the audience at the Tribeca Film Festival was laughing throughout the whole thing. and If you're lucky enough to have it open in your city, be sure to see it on the big screen instead of DVD. All the principals turn in solid performances. The writers turn in a good script with enough twists and turns and visual gags to keep you giggling throughout all the way to the predictable conclusion. This is an old - fashioned screwball comedy, with ridiculously coincidental plot twists, stock characters (given some depth in fun performances by John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff) and a straightforward approach to the political content."
6754,"Although with Gervais taking a different approach to the material then what most other leading men would do in this situation, Ghost Town becomes a film that people will actually enjoy and not roll their eyes at. With every film in which a living character can see and speak with ghosts, you get the obligatory "" Is he crazy? "" With comedic actors like Mike Meyers and Eddie Murphy failing to get laughs (Love guru, Meet Dave) it's nice to see the light shine on someone else. He does a decent job of pacing the film with the laughs and adding the emotional punches when it's needed. You'll get some laughs from here, Tea Leoni holds her own and Greg Kinnear has the hardest part in the entire film."
6753,"Samuel L. Jackson has had a vibrant career portraying characters in two spectrums of the acting realm. (Black Snake Moan, Resurrecting the Champ, Coach Carter) Lakeview Terrace to some extent blurs this boundary, but for the most part Jackson plays his role straight, and he is very good because of it. Despite an encroaching wildfire, things are routine on Lakeview; Abel patrols the neighbourhood at night, loves his job and wants nothing more then to protect his family. Blissfully free of any modern fast cuts or flashy editing, it takes you back to a time when thrillers had a dash of inspiration and flair. As the man carrying the film, Samuel L. Jackson turns in an excellent performance as the protagonist of the tale, constantly giving his victims flourishes of false hope then unnervingly reverting back to his unpleasantness and conceitedness."
6751,"Maybe the original was really something, but this version is dead on arrival and should be saved for the second DVD in a video night, when you want everyone to leave your house and let you get some sleep. Not a fresh thing in Asian movies, but something that the (re) makers of this film bet the Americans will find cool. "" Bangkok Dangerous "" isn't a bad film â€“ or at least not as bad as most of the reviews around here claim â€“ but it is an astonishingly ordinary film that features literally every clichÃ© of "" hired assassin "" concept you can possibly think of. There's the lonely and super-skilled hit man who intents to pull of one last job before quitting the business for good, he teaches his errand boy to become his successor, finds love and happiness with a girl for the first time and â€“ last but not least â€“ refuses to make the final hit because his target is a noble individual. In the original, the hit man was a deaf - mute but since Nicolas Cage is far too expensive to have him shut up the whole time, they made his love interest a deaf - mute instead."
6750,"The visuals and art direction were amazing, strong cinematography, very "" Roger Rabbity "" sorta feel with the rotoscoping of some scenes, his tie, shoes, backdrops etc. . And most of the dialogue is delivered in soliloquy (including a scene where The Spirit talks to a cat for 5 minutes)."
6971,"Later these moved to the movie serials and B movies, whence they were lifted, in the 1970s and 1980s, as the inspiration for movies like RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, ROMANCING THE STONE and STAR WARS. CURSE OF THE OF JUDAS CHALICE is no ground - breaking movie, but it is enormous fun, with a script full of hip, self - aware humor--Noah Wyle explains the key plot points as he goes along, and is twitted for always speaking in complete paragraphs--action and a sexy vampiress. Jane Curtin and Bob Newhart are back as Flynn's bosses at the magical library, and Curtin's role has been beefed up a bit. A recent Bond girl, the very lovely Stana Katic, plays Flynn's exotic, ass - kicking love interest. amusing and entertaining for adults without including content inappropriate for even young children."
6749,"Don't expect the most brilliant bits from the paper to be transformed into movie bits - it's closer to one of their good issues being written into a movie, with brilliant bits, so - so bits, and annoying bits. Some bits are funnier than others, with a few running gags that recur throughout the movie. It's just so hilarious how they throw everything at you out of the blue and just keep it coming. Take these wonderful bittersweet newscasts and spice them up with the occasional series of well - written skits between them, including a felon holding up a bank and "" stealing "" a job, and you have the delicious, stale pastry of clever banality that is The Onion Movie."
6748,"Jada Pinkett Smith's character is used as nothing more than a ploy to appear modern, having an African American lesbian character, but in actuality she is there to just look cool. There is one glimmering hope in the film, however little it is allowed to shine surrounded by the dim and dying stars around it is Cloris Leachman. If one can divorce oneself from the George Cukor original, and one must to be able to sit through it, there are a few pleasures to be had, mostly thanks to Cloris Leachman, Candice Bergen (playing Meg Ryan's mom for the second time, remember "" Rich and Famous ""?) For starters, casting Meg Ryan in the central role proves almost fatal to the movie because somehow she seems to have locked herself into some sort of limbo where women don't really change appearances, even after 20 years of working in the movies. "" The Women "" in its present reincarnation needs to go back and rework itself, much like "" The Hulk "" did it this year, find more suitable performers, a really good writer, and most of all, someone who truly treasures what good movies are about."
6747,"A worthwhile trip through the disturbing events of Katrina, an honest film, even if on occasion not so subtly directing its viewers towards particular and easily - held opinions. It turns out that the couple filming is a set of intriguing characters with admirable qualities. The most amazing footage is the pre-Katrina scenes. While Michael Moore veterans Carl Deal and Tia Lessin add structure and social commentary to the film this is Kimberly â€™s show. This is a very powerful study of the devastation from the "" ground "" floor--thanks to Kimberly Rivers Roberts (and her husband Scott) home videos."
6682,"Finally Dreamworks have managed to surpass the achievements of Pixar. while playing their parts in a very different manner to each other, both are note perfect. After the disappointing SHREK 3 and the only "" cute "" OVER THE HEDGE, DreamWorks Animation finally delivers another highlight to the CGI animated universe. Go see it, it also works for adults. It will be a big hit for DWA, north of 200 millions domestic, eventually even 300 mil."
6746,"it was suspenseful, had great twists, the acting was superb, and was a great story. The film's dialog is well written, making up for the sometimes slow pacing scenes that take awhile to transpire. After one of the better villainous performances of the year in Vantage Point, Taghmaoui delivers a performance just as deep and riveting as Cheadle's. On the positive side, the acting in "" Traitor "" is uniformly great, without standout performances from Don Cheadle and Guy Pearce as the lead characters. This was an excellent movie, a very intriguing and topical story involving terrorism with the basic message that there are good and bad people everywhere, of all races, religions, sects, whatever."
7211,"And, through a number a picaresque episodes, she either does or doesn't (note: no spoiler here). Just one warning: keep it away from kids and adults who feel that nudity and sex should be swept under the rug regardless of their necessity for the emotional impact of the story. She marches off bravely into the rain, a big smile on her face, triumphant music swelling in the background. Though it is common, European art movies are known to bring out the emotions really well. After fruitlessly banging dozens of guys of varying temperaments and races and quirks, she finds Jaime and everything seems to be going along swimmingly."
6745,"The presentation of the near future world in "" Babylon A. D. "" is beautifully done. Compare and contrast the difference between the collapsing, grunge - like, shabby Eastern Bloc, with the hi - tech, neon lit New York. "" Babylon A. D. "" also has a really intriguing cast (Charlotte Rampling, Mark Strong, Michelle Yeoh, GÃ©rard Depardieu), some good action sequences and an interesting, if derivative, plot. The action scenes were also enjoyable. Babylon A. D. is the perfect example of suit and tie butchery; an artistic, intelligent piece of work obviously dragged down in the cutting room into an incoherent, clunkering mix of the genuinely interesting and the downright mundane."
6744,"Movies are something you should enjoy, and this."
6743,"Just don't go in expecting a movie that looks as beautiful as many of their movies do - Lubezki is no Deakins, at least not based on his work here, and the Coens are very clearly attempting to emulate in many ways the look of the sort of thriller they're basing this on. George Clooney is also terrific and the Coens move through their crossed purposes with speed and elegance. From the opening moments, the Coens' latest movie--a spy - thriller spoof--hurls the viewer on a hilarious romp through Absurd - land. As usual, the Coens' dialog is a real treat. Notions of "" intelligence "" and all that the word connotes (along with its antonyms) mix into the film's dark comedic brew of unintended consequences."
6722,"The promotional material for this Sundance winner for Best Direction in a Documentary suggests that the five teenagers who make up the main subjects follow in the stereotypical footsteps of THE BREAKFAST CLUB. There's Hannah, the rebel (who is really more of an artist than a rebel), Colin, the jock (who defies all preconceived notions of what it means to be a jock), Megan, the princess (who delights in drama and the suffering of others), Jake, the geek (who naturally plays video games and is in the school band) and Mitch, the heartthrob (who barely leaves an impression on the viewer like the others). Burstein followed these five kids and a good number of their friends for the entire 2006 scholastic year at Warsaw Community High School. They had troubles with their parents, with their friends, with where they would go to college and with what the prom theme would be, to name but a few of the daily dramas in their lives. Some have moved on while others still hear the echoes of torment or thrill in their minds."
6741,"The "" Oh it's funny 'cause she's a dumb blonde "" antics and general social awkwardness of the characters is just something you take in kind with this genre, but where this movie just completely collapses over its vacuousness is the part in all of these intelligent blonde movies where the outlier intelligent guy sees through the fashion to the real person underneath. The character of Natalie and her gushing geekiness in some scenes seems exactly like what's popular right now, save the situations where they put her in front of boys and make her downright retarded. Decent comedy, but most of the laughs are to be had in the first half - discounting the grating opening Playboy mansion sequence, that is - and as the plot starts to kick in the jokes seem to take a back seat."
6630,"A producer trying to change Bruce Willis' mind is pretty funny, but how funny is it to a non-producer or a non-Bruce-Willis? Here the prototypes are well known even by people who have nothing to do with the film industry so one gets a bit impatient waiting for this fresh look from a prominent, still active, Hollywood producer. It is a little like entourage minus the girls and absurdity as it is centered around Hollywood but you do sympathize with the lead character a lot on his reactions to events. This film won't appeal to everyone, but it does have some good one liners and funny moments. The film is certainly enjoyable, and has several laugh - out - loud moments."
6740,"Along the way prisons have been handed over to the private sector that have chosen to make a profit by broadcasting gladiatorial style death matches starring the inmates, with the reward to the inmates after 5 victories â€“ FREEDOM Enter Jensen Ames (Jason Stratham) a recently unemployed steel worker and former race car driver who lost his license but no matter how bad things are, he's a happy man as long as he has his family. The first 2 days are competition / elimination rounds reminiscent of Mario Kart as if it was designed by some rogue member of GTA on a disgruntled day but who loved the hidden short cuts and power - ups. From there, exciting vehicles chases scenes and blood ooze out. Surprisingly, Anderson rises to the occasion, effortlessly elevating a clichÃ© - rich but fast - moving script to the level of a satisfyingly adrenalin - fueled confection aimed like a bullet at the A. D. D. - addled brains of the short - attention - span generation. The script follows correctly an old tested and tried recipe, everything is at its place, and although you can easily plot out the whole course since the beginning, somewhat even this sounds good - you simply have the guilty pleasure of savoring again a story that you know from dozens of other movies."
6739,"The film, which details the bizarre misadventures of a pair of pre-teen star crossed lovers, one of whom is an androgynous vampire, is phenomenal in almost every regard. A lonely boy, Oskar, befriends the girl next door, Eli, and with her help overcomes the school bullies. The details of young Oskar's (Kare Hedebrant) life are spot on. 12 - year - olds Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) and Eli (Lina Leandersson) meet one snowy afternoon at a jungle gym in the courtyard of Oskar's housing complex outside Stockholm. Everything in this film is well - made in synchronization."
6624,"Guru Pitka is a self help guru who is very successful, but he is ranked as the number two self help guru of the world. The only bright spots were Justin Timberlake as a Lothario Quebecquer and the fairly fun Bollywood - style Indian dance number at the end of the movie. Pitka devotes his life and his teachings to helping other people out with their relationship troubles, and hopes his words of wisdom will become so popular, he'll wind up on Oprah. One minute Pitka is being hailed as a spiritual healer who lives to help people and the next minute he's insulting a midget for no particular reason. Movies that just aren't that great, aren't interesting, lack that certain spark that a Great Movie always has."
6738,"Folman, like many young Israeli men in the '80s, joined the army to fight in Lebanon when he was merely 18 (this was in 1982), thinking he could serve his country in the best way possible. Once the war was over, Folman's new career began, and he is now a successful actor, director and writer (among other things, he worked on the TV show that inspired HBO's In Treatment). Folman's introspective journey begins with the lack of memory: apparently, he and many of his fellow soldiers have trouble remembering the exact details of what happened in Lebanon. This gives the picture a feel that is both evocative and down - to - earth, a bizarre but powerful combination that has earned Waltz With Bashir comparisons with the similarly merciless Apocalypse Now. Waltz with Bashir may not deliver everything you expect after seeing the trailers, but it is powerful."
7242,"That is how Thavi came to think of his family members and those like them. Instead he woke up alive the next day in Thailand, and he became a street boy in Bankock for two years, when the rest of his family managed to come and they all went to a refugee camp. How Thavi got into filmmaking and where he acquired such good video camera's from?"
6737,"There were some really spectacular scenes and vistas. There is plenty of action, some great fight scenes, and some creepy moments - but that's your lot! It sounds pretty clichÃ©, right, but weirdly it works here and the characters are compelling despite not being characterized much. and beautiful scenery, The Mutant Chronicles chooses the less trodden path of gunfire, disposable characters and mutants. During a battle between Capitol and Bauhaus, the great seal is broken and The Machine works again transforming soldiers and civilians in hordes of mutants."
6615,"This is a Will Ferrell comedy, everyone should have some funny moments. Semi-Pro is a funny film but it's really only semi-funny, whereas the rest of Ferrell's movies were hilarious romps. The movie was pretty sports - comedy formulaic, with the down - and - out lovable losers getting a big chance, then introducing a new character who will inspire them, and a few montages later, the big finale. It has some of the fun ad libbed dialogue Ferrel's movies are known for and is one of those scenes you know will have outtakes on the DVD. But Semi-Pro pretty much gives Ferrell all the funny moments, when his other movies like Anchorman gave the other characters classic moments as well."
6899,"Sacha Gervasi's documentary traces the bands unfortunate history and catches up with them 30 years later, capturing the amazing story of their last - ditch attempt to snatch fame from the jaws of obscurity. Now in their 50s they have kept Anvil ticking over, supporting themselves with menial jobs and persisting despite the exasperation of their friends and loved ones. At this point, their commitment to Anvil seems relatively benign until Lips gets word from an Eastern European woman he met online (yes, really) that she has organised a full European tour for them and suddenly they see one final opportunity to give Anvil the success it deserves. Prone to violent outbursts and equally sudden, heartfelt apologies he is the heart of the band but also its biggest liability. Robb is his calm and Zen - like foil (with a penchant for scatological art) and their exchanges are never less than entertaining but are also surprisingly emotional."
6736,"Saw this tonight at Sundance and was torn between two notions: Notion 1: This is a classic Sundance movie. If you don't mind slow movies, Henry Poole will reward you with a story that celebrates simple virtues, and suggests that there is plenty of room in this world for kindness and charity and faith and hope. This kind of a film is what romantic movies are for real life love: a fairy tale, a beautiful lie that makes one (not terminally ill) feel better about oneself. Overall, its a beautiful composition and keeps one riveted, although lacking in frills. This film really shows the contrasting belief systems between those who simply can't believe in such things and those who perhaps, see miracles everywhere."
6735,"Star Wars used to be the cutting edge in visual effects; apparently the makers of this movie haven't the ways in which computer animation have advanced in the last decade. A long time ago, George Lucas was capable of putting out material that kids and adults could both enjoy, that fanboys and the casual moviegoer could both enjoy, and no one would have to suspend their sensibilities to have a good time. And the grand scale scenes were pretty impressive. Great movie for the little kids and people that are going to watch the TV series but you need to be a true Star Wars fan to love this movie. The dynamic between Anakin Skywalker and his new sidekick, will grate on the nerves of anyone over the age of 8 years old."
7608,"The guy is eccentric, with shaved pubes, and dresses in hip - hop clothes. A home invasion scene between two ex-lovers is suspenseful, and in a dark way, kinda funny."
6734,"You have the likes of Ben Stiller, Robert Downey Jr, Jack Black, Jay Baruchel, Steve Coogan, and Nick Nolte all turning in terrific comedic performances that they obviously had fun with. Jack Black's Jeff Portney reins in his comedian schtick to portray a hardened solider, voice rasping as he shows his serious side; Stiller's Tugg Speedman attempts to revive the action cred he tried to leave behind with his Oscar - bait turn as a mentally handicapped man in Simple Jack, where he went "" full retarded, no one ever comes back from that ""; and Robert Downey Jr.'s Kirk Lazarus, Australian genius at his craft, playing a black man like he was born one. Of course they do it all with that post-modernist, deconstuctionist, ironic flavour, but, unlike their forebears - Bob Hope, Jack Benny, Jack Lemmon - they are neither funny nor particularly attractive as characters! There's a lot of tortured movie - about - movies humor that never really gets any traction. The star of the movie by far is Robert Downey Jr who is simply perfect but the real scene stealer is Tom Cruise, though his screen time is limited, his scenes are hilarious."
6723,"It is hard to put into words just how good this film is, and on just how many levels it works. It is intensely fun, good - natured, laugh - out - loud funny at times, poignant and heart - wrenching at others. The images, not just of the central feat, but of many of Philippe Petit's performances are arresting and jaw - droppingly beautiful. By placing Phillip Petit pivotal in the narration of the events unfolding, a passionate man with an almost half - mad gleam in his eye but also a love of life that leaps across the screen as utterly genuine. The interviews with him and his friends and "" team "" who helped pull off the stunt are extremely interesting and great to watch."
6732,"He is one of the best actors in the world, but sometimes plys his trade in the likes of films like "" Thunderbirds "", "" A Sound Of Thunder "" and "" The Love Guru "". "" Elegy "" has some seriously good, sure footed performances. Patrica Clarkson, as Kapesh's long standing mistress, defines hurt and betrayal, Penelope Cruz completely puts word to the lie of one daft critic who said that she simply cannot act in the English language, but the surprise here is Dennis Hopper: His performance as Kapesh's best friend is light years away from the eye rolling villain that he normally portrays to make a crust. Despite of his great culture, the intellectual David is a man that has grown old but never grown up, and he is unable to last a relationship, including with his oncologist son Kenneth Kepesh (Peter Sarsgaard). When he meets the elegant, educated and gorgeous Cuban student Consuela Castillo (PenÃ©lope Cruz) in his literature class, he feels a great sexual attraction for her and seduces her in the end of the period."
6730,"Things to look for are slower pace, beautiful scenery / Mis - en - scene, cool Asian music, a lot of metaphors, lots of fighting (everybody loves them!) Kaneshiro Takeshi did some very good face acting to portray well the wittiness that his look would normally lack, as it is a significant feature of Zhuge Liang's characteristics. He also does well in comedic moments. Also the storytelling is great and full of excellent metaphors, the characters got depths and smarts. One which is based on sincerity, a quality which persuaded his chief military strategist and genius all round Zhuge Liang (Takeshi Kaneshiro) to join his cause, but one which lacked military strength in numbers, despite having some of the best generals of the time under his leadership."
6689,"But if you aren't easily offended and are a fan of Adam Sandler's work, then you'll have fun with the silky smooth goodness that Zohan brings to the table. - inspired haircut and a penchant for shtupping elderly women, he finds employment at a small salon run by the sweet, yet blank, Dalia (Emmanuelle Chriqui), a Palestinian woman with no patience for Zohan's sexism. Zohan looks like it will be a daring and imaginative comedy but, beyond the basic design of the film the material is pretty much what you would expect from an Adam Sandler film in so much as it is crude, silly and aimed at a teenage market. Refusing to work in an electric store, Zohan finds work as a cleaner in a small salon run by a Palestinian woman, where he waits his chance to prove his skills. If your expectations are high going into movies like this, then please, do yourself a favor and never watch a movie again."
6617,"10, 000BC is the cafeteria lasagna. The producers make some nice gestures toward Ice Age realism with their portrayal of the encampment of the mammoth hunters, who have cool dreadlocks (like most folks in prehistoric movies nowadays), cool face paint, fancy bone weapons & jewelry, and appropriately furry garments. Luckily, the crafty alien god has lots of slaves and a ready source of desert living woolly mammoths to help build his pyramid. The heroes are an unnamed tribal people who speak perfect English, all have the bodies of supermodels, and hunt mammoths for food. The mammoths didn't look at hokey, but they moved very woodenly, computer - like."
6729,"There were so many laugh out loud scenes and the interaction between the characters was pure gold. Seth Rogen is also very funny but you can guess that this is actually his character. There will be others who recognize it as a bizarrely artful, playful, loose genre - bending comedy with some outstanding performances, an inspired comedy script, and some great work from director David Gordon Green, certainly one of the finest young directors around. "" Pineapple Express "" is, as a whole, the best movie the Apatow clan has produced yet. David Gordon Green is unquestionably the best director to direct one of these movies, but this is also a very different sort of movie than the films he usually directs."
6978,"The first half of the film builds up the case for Santi's involvement in mysterious murders and hints at supernatural elements--parallels with vampires and werewolves. With such instant classics as' The Orphanage,' ' Rec,' and' Pan's Labyrinth' (questionably horror, still, but impossible to not mention), Spain has aided in giving some much - needed relief from the seemingly unending stretch of Hollywood unoriginality. but the real gem is "" Shiver "", available on DVD. 0'), cinematography of Josep M. Civit (' Guerreros'), and the production design of Pilar Revuelta (' Pan's Labyrinth'),' Shiver' is presented as a strikingly attractive film with some extremely beautiful and well captured settings. is solid and the music from Fernando Velazquez sounds like the classics."
6843,"Daniel Craig and Live Schreiber are terrific as Tuvia and Zus Bielski, who lead a band of Jewish forest partisans during World War Two, thus saying over a thousand lives. Craig and Schreiber manage very good Slavic accents, both when speaking English and when speaking the Slavic languages, but Craig occasionally lapses into his English accent when speaking English. While this film is very good, it doesn't have the production values to be a timeless classic like "" Schindler's List . "" Most of the controversies are shallow relative to the most important facts at hand. The most important fact is this: the Nazis committed a genocide of six million Jews."
7240,"If you loved the first few seasons, you will love this! The film is exiting, gripping, it uses every one of its minutes effectively, and it is much more plausible with its plot and Jack's relations and intentions. The character archs, gigantic sequence of unravelings and long - term investment in the characters is inherently designed for hours and hours of television. 24 is back with this 2hour special' bridge' between series 6 and 7, which sees ex CTU Agent Jack Bauer in a war torn African nation hiding from the crimes he committed whilst saving the United States in the previous seasons of 24. It starts slow though, with a good thirty minutes of establishing material and scene setting before any urgency kicks in."
7347,"The fast - paced documentary is directed by Bill Corben (Raw Deal) and edited by David Cypkin. With CC2 Corben does an excellent job of grabbing the audience by the throat and never letting them go. The filmmaker does a good job of not only talking to the police about the Cocaine Cowboys but also talks to the Cocaine Cowboys themselves. While some might enjoy it less then CC1, it's still good."
7309,"The scenes in between the supernatural images and occurrences focus on how each family member (and some friends) deal with all that happens, and it is done in a refreshingly realistic (not over-blown, sentimental, or dramatic) way. There are a few twists along the way, and the final scene is very well - done, and will stay with you for a long time. The premise is this: a nice ordinary family in a rural town are heartbroken when their 15 year old daughter drowns at a family picnic. The film is actually about the mind bending emotions the family experience in missing their beloved daughter but not wanting her as a ghost. It is not a violent movie, nor is it a Blair Witch wannabee, it is a melancholy ghost movie with a terrific emotional dilemma and absolutely hair raising fright scenes."
6620,"Steve Carell also did an amazing job as the Mayor of Whoville. It also has good, clean humor that is both funny and suitable for all ages. It's up to Horton to find a safe place for the speck to save Who - ville from destruction, even as the well - meaning pachyderm has to avoid all sorts of obstacles, including Sour Kangaroo, Vlad the Vulture, the Wickersham brothers, and other metaphors of McCarthyism. As usual with such a thin material, the film has the obligatory additional scenes to pad the running time but all in all, it captures the spirit of its source, and it's a case where a G - rated film provides entertainment both to kids and their older companions as well. So far, this is the best possible example of bringing a Dr. Seuss book to life."
7247,"Since season 1, South Park's visuals have improved themselves, and now they are to the best South Park ever: a trilogy / movie with the satire David Zucker still had in the first' Scary Movie', the satire of Tim Burton's' Mars Attacks! ' , a certain complexness and a humor that's just so. Imaginationland is without a doubt one of the best thing trey and Scott have produced in years, it's a clever and interesting series of episodes that together conclude in one of the most epic stories ever seen on the show. South Park's Imaginationland was originally a three - parter episode. Imaginationland is a great movie which is just as good as Bigger, Longer and Uncut."
6619,"Writer and Director Neil Marshall (Dog Soldiers, The Descent) an obvious student of genre movies, has managed to smoothly craft together a cinematic Frankenstein's monster of sci - fi action clichÃ©s. Marshall has skillfully engineered what is truly an homage to the genre movie and an action buffet for moviegoers with appropriate kitsch and over-the-topness without lowering himself to the realm of spoof. They are attacked fiercely by a large number of punks and since the team was so unprepared it made you wonder what information they had from the photographs taken from the satellite. what it is - a tongue in cheek splatter fest homage to the great John Carpenter movies of the 80s and with a bunch of mad max thrown in. It's pretty reminiscent of Grindhouse: Planet Terror, so if you enjoyed that modern cult classic, you could get some kicks out of this one too."
6684,"The performances are pitch perfect and but Laura Dern in particular should win an Emmy for her portrayal of Katherine Harris. There are two immutable facts that were brought out in this excellent film: one, Florida looked absolutely ridiculous in the way they conducted elections; and two, the 2000 election was absolutely stolen. The recount notwithstanding, the manipulation of the voter roles and the subsequent disenfranchisement of 20, 000 voters by the clownish Katherine Harris, played perfectly by Laura Dern, casts a permanent stain on the legitimacy of the Bush presidency. It was compelling and exciting and the performances of stars like Kevin Spacey, Tom Wilkinson, and Dern made you forget that you knew the ending. This is a fascinating look at the mess in FL in 2000, and goes through everything that happened step by step."
6693,"Shyamalan, who was using close - ups and steadicam shots to frankly brilliant effect early on, begins to use the same shots to comical effect. That scene may very well be the turning point in the film, with Wahlberg's acting becoming more ridiculous by the second, culminating in a performance that essentially wipes from memory all his tremendous recent achievements as an actor. Besides being amazingly, ridiculously gorgeous she is a fine actress and creates a sympathetic character (and a fairly well - drawn one at that - one of the few pros in Shyamalan's script). It is enjoyable and fits nicely into the apocalyptic genre but' Signs' has done this sort of idea before and did it better. Film - making is a collaborative experience, but in the case of this film it is clear that no one bothered to be honest with Mr. Shyamalan."
7263,"The late Anthony Minghella's early credits included writing several episodes of' Inspector Morse', so there's a symmetry in the fact that his final film as a director was another story about a fictional detective, namely Alexander MacCall Smith's Precious Ramotse, the eponymous No. 1 lady detective in Botswana. With the Sunday evening broadcast slot on the British terrestrial channels normally reserved for shows of a gentle nature with a good level of quality, The' Morses' of this world. The direction naturally focused on the lush African landscapes but also has some lovely shots of the cast. It's rare indeed to see studios with big bucks backing a film with this kind of plot or synopsis, let alone for it to be made in Africa and with an unknown cast. This time - slot has traditionally been a chance for the BBC to show a production which will appeal to all the family and N1LDA fitted the category very well."
6695,"If anything is proof that popular films can be of a stunningly high quality, the beauty of the animation, writing, music, and sound design in "" WALL Â· E "" is it. "" WALL Â· E "" operates on two levels (and works spectacularly well on both). The depiction of humans on the ship could have been incredibly offensive, cheap, and tasteless in concept but the execution here is absolutely perfect. Not only it's Pixar's best film of all - time but it's the best movie of this year and one of the greatest imaginative, visually, moving & excellent animated films in years and surprisingly, one of the best sci - fi movies since E. T.! Coming with high expectations, it definitely succeeded mines."
6618,"Over-thorough character introductions cause a slower build in the early stages of the heist, but such complications likely arise from fewer liberties taken with the "" based on a true story "" events, and the result is a fascinating look at criminals, the corrupt, and those least guilty. The true elements of "" The Bank Job, "" some hidden until recently by Britain's "" D Notice "" censorship law (modified in 1993, becoming DA, or Defense Advisory) are these: 1. "" The Bank Job "" director Roger Donaldson (of "" No Way Out "") brings together all these true threads in a way that may be true even in its totality, director and cast prevailing over some shoddy work from too many writers. It builds up the plot lines and tries somewhat successfully to tie everything together. Saffron Burrows, James Spader's vamp nemesis on "" Boston Legal, "" brings her remarkable name and looks to the criminally and emotionally ambiguous major female role."
6819,"Riveting, moving, without concessions and Benicio del Toro is just extraordinary. Extraordinary focus is given to Che meeting the volunteers who accompany his guerrilla factions. In Part 1, in Cuba, the rebels are welcomed by the people of the villages, given food and cover, supported in what grows to be a victorious revolution. There are remarkable sporadic visceral shots, but being few they are all the more powerful, such as Che's POV shot during his final beats. Benicio Del Toro, one of the film's producers, gives a champion's performance, not least because it's modest."
6680,"Every time those strangers come and go like ghosts of some kind, it makes the audience sit back once more and say,' Ah, well, it's just a movie. They appear and disappear seemingly at will and instantly - a power the young couple probably wished they had but don't because they are, after all, HUMANS. Liv Tyler does a convincing job of making you feel the fright and a lot of the acting is non-verbal. Both Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman do well in their leading roles, and the strangers themselves are things of pure terror. Movies such as the Shining were incredible based on imagery and superb acting."
6679,"She is a huge fan of the show, has every season on DVD, and has seen all the episodes multiple times. The characters are older now and, after the series ended, all partnered up to a certain degree and "" happy "" in their relationships. There were very very few lines that gave a glimpse of the old clever dialog, and they all got lost in a mass of cheesy lines about love and friendship that you even rarely anymore encounter in the corniest of Hollywood's chick flicks, and toiler humor that you only expect from movies like Harold and Kumar."
6836,"Bedtime Stories is a PG - rated comedy about hotel maintenance guy Skeeter Bronson (Adam Sandler), who babysits his impossibly cute niece Bobbi (Laura Ann Kesling) and nephew Patrick (Jonathan Morgan Heit) for his uptight sister Wendy (Courteney Cox). Sandler rules: This is one of the best children / adult stories this year, an ironic twist on romantic and heroic tales told from children's point of view through the masterful child / adult lens of an underplaying, child - friendly master. It actually can be enjoyed by all ages in the family. When the Webster Elementary School where Wendy (Courteney Cox) is the principal will be closed to be demolished, she needs to travel to Arizona for a job interview. He's the usual Sandler sweet - hearted semi-loser with reserves of child - like sympathies ready to be released."
6837,"It's this same feeling that infected both the Fight Club and Choke novels and made them perverse joys to read. Palahniuk's touch even translated perfectly in David Fincher's adaptation. On one hand, the laughs managed to stay more or less consistent, with none of the jokes falling flat. First - timer Gregg manages to handle his duties (which include writing, directing and even one very amusing bit part) with confidence, balancing comedy with drama effectively. Rockwell manages to nail Victor perfectly, yet it's Brad William Henke that manages to steal several scenes as Victor's friend Denny."
6838,"That's whats so interesting about this, you may have friends or neighbors in relationships like this, that would never think of. Everything seems great on the outside, but behind closed doors, it's a different story. There are many themes in this film, mainly being love, marriage, relationships, and life. DiCaprio and Winslet give powerhouse performances. All around great and believable performances with a small role by Michael Shannon, who shines as the crazy guy who tells it how it is."
6841,"The film is made by someone on a mission (albeit a confused one at times) but the end result is a film that is raw and intimate. The film is narrated in a very smart way with plenty of smash cuts. You hold onto their love and hope through the last few minutes, and eventually you find what the narrator finds: inspiration. Kuenne uses the cinematic tool to document history, make a tribute for beloved friends (not only Andrew and little Zachary, but also Andrew's parents, David and Kathleen, the emotional core of this story) and to instigate the audience, both emotionally and intellectually. When most movies that get a wide release don't even attempt either of these goals, this is a remarkable achievement."
6991,"JERUSALEMA investigates the spirit of the individual to assert himself against both the system ad poverty. Might is right and possession is none tenths of the law. The director gives an unbiased view of the contemporary landscape, which most South Africans are aware of, but turn a blind eye. It casts a fresh eye on the recent manifestations of xenophobia. Beautiful photography, haunting music and excellent acting by a cast of unknowns."
6704,"This moment was captured well in "" Where the Buffalo Roam "" starring Bill Murray as HST, which is given kind of short shrift in this documentary in favor of scenes from "" Fear and Loathing Las Vegas "" with Johnny Depp as HST. Considering that Depp produced and narrates the film as well as financed the grandiose send - off that Thompson envisioned for himself, it's not strange that Murray's portrayal would be downplayed, as excellent as it was (and Peter Boyle's as the Samoan lawyer.) All in all, it is a well - balanced account of Thompson's life and work, with many pertinent interviewees like his two wives and son, Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone, Sonny Barger of the Hell's Angels, Jimmy Buffett, George McGovern, Jimmy Carter, Pat Buchanan, Tom Wolfe, and various Aspenites. His passion and wit were undeniable, and his addiction to guns, booze and dope were in many ways forgivable. Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr Hunter S. Thompson is a very well put together documentary from Alex Gibney, whose Enron: the Smartest Guys in the Room was a fascinating insight into the fluff and fraud of a section of Corporate America in the early years of the 21st century."
6638,"With the lure of big money, Dodge is able to convince Carter Rutherford (John Krasinski) to drop out of college and join the team. Zellweger's ambitious Lexie Littleton doggedly pursues the truth behind the tall tales, all the while being pursued by the meant - to - be charming football has - been Connelly and the bright eyed Rutherford, who's reputation she is meant to dismantle. While Clooney's smooth - talking Connelly was written with the intent of being charming, his actions oftentimes appear more arrogant than anything else. Krasinski's Rutherford is by far the most charming and likable character in the film; his aw - shucks demeanor is disarmingly enchanting. Most of the truly funny moments are between the two, honoring slapstick bits made famous in early cinema."
6994,"Written by and starring the extremely talented William H. Macy and directed by his long - time friend and veteran TV movie director Steven Schachter, The Deal is part vanity piece, part industry insider self - indulgence and wholly funny. Macy plays Charlie Berns, a one - hit wonder Hollywood producer with no money and no prospects and on the verge of suicide. Ignoring the script, Charlie returns to his morbid task, only to spot an article about a blockbuster action - hero movie star (L. L. Cool J) who has recently converted to Judaism and is looking for a Jewish film for his next project. But he's learned enough tricks, and developed enough chutzpah that with a little luck he can really work the system. The Deal was a few cameos short of brilliant and a bit light on the darker sides."
6842,"There's some promising new talent, good laughs and sweet lines in this delightfully cheesy romantic comedy. The abundance of hair dressing scenes, shopping scenes and dancing scenes is an indication that "" Wild Child "" is a fluffy movie that goes very well with popcorn. The plot is realistic and yet dramatic enough to keep viewers interested. The friendships that Poppy created are well portrayed and told. Adults will enjoy this movie more than teenagers; teenagers rarely understand coming - of - age movies as they have yet to experience it."
6670,"The Pevensie kids, just like the last time, add the right amount of drama and humor to their respective roles. Also worth mentioning is King Miraz, a great villain since Tilda Swinton. As for a few cameo appearances you should also look out for, the performances are remarkable. The Art Direction and the locations are astounding, very vibrant and unlike anything you would have ever seen in film. Director Andrew Adamson, who helmed the first installment in the series, after making his career primarily in animation (including the original "" Shrek "") seems decidedly more comfortable in his role as a live action director this time around, and he handles the scope and the pacing of this epic adventure with a polished skill that is a very pleasant surprise."
6997,""" Gigantic's "" main protagonist is twenty - eight year old Brian - a morose, monosyllabic mattress salesman. Big Al purchases an expensive mattress and later sends his beautiful daughter to settle the bill. The discerning few can easily see this as a subtext for the demons of self - doubt tormenting Brian's mind. Wes Anderson and Jason Reitman and Judd Apatow are practitioners of this dynamic. The great Ed Asner and John Goodman, playing Brian and Happy's dads respectively, tear up the screen every time they appear, whether hunting for magic mushroom or hawking up their own brain tumours by willpower alone."
6844,"Jennifer Aniston was great too, she really delivered. Wonderful movie about life as the characters played by Jennifer Anniston and Owen Wilson get married and start their life together with the "" most stupidest dog in the world "". Lots of laughs in this movie but also as the story unfolds with the Grogan's careers and family they all love their dog "" Marley "". The film follows John from his wedding night to the peak of his journalism career a dozen years later, years that are chronicled in his weekly columns for a Florida newspaper. Similarly, both Wilson and Aniston deliver understated performances that convey the ups - and - downs of any marriage."
6845,"Composer Joe Hisaishi underscores this intensity, calling up mighty swells of strings to accompany Ponyo's first ascent to the surface, and later evoking Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries in a stunning sequence where Ponyo chases down a speeding car while running atop a cascading tsunami of gigantic fish. It is a simple, pure vision, guilelessly washed across with a devoted kindergartener's finger paints. Ponyo may at times feel so unique and fresh, it may feel alien like. Hayao Miyazaki's magic continues with this absolute crowd pleaser Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea, his latest animated film, which turns on the usual sweetness to charm your socks off. Ponyo (voiced by Nara Yuria) is a magic goldfish that yearns to know what is life beyond the sea, with her constant forays in a bubble to the surface of the water to sneak a peek."
6637,"Slick camera work and some good performances rev up the technical quality of this fact - based story about a 21 year old MIT student named Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) who, along with his brainy Ivy League chums, travels to Vegas to win tons of money at the blackjack tables. Rosa has devised an elaborate and conspiratorial card counting scheme that consists of code words and hand gestures. The film's pace starts off leisurely, then alternates between fast - paced Vegas casino action and periods of downtime wherein Ben and his girlfriend, fellow conspirator Jill (Kate Bosworth), talk shop and take in the high life. There are lots of elaborate camera dissolves and close - ups. The best parts of the film are the close - ups of the characters at the blackjack tables."
7127,"In his teens, which is when the film properly begins, he goes on to pinball between the two very different women, the stoic Mimi (a surprisingly well - cast Kristin Scott Thomas, transplanting that glorious sang - froid to Liverpool) and the flighty, possibly manic - depressive Julia (Anne Marie Duff, also excellent). It tells the untold story of the late teenage years of one of the greatest musicians of all time, John Lennon and the strong influences his mother Julia Lennon (Anne - Marie Duff) and his aunt Mimi Smith (Kristin Scott Thomas) who created the foundation for his future as a person and the indelible mark he was about to leave on music forever. This is a great film, the art direction and set design allow the viewer to feel as though they are there in those rooms on those days. The story is beautifully handled from beginning to end and the acting from the three main leads is superb. More successfully evoked is the mothballed late 1950s, but also a sense of real change coming up from the streets."
6718,"And, as with all such movies, you must be able to look beyond the literal. ' Clearly one must see the allusion to the work, in this case, of a superhero who hopes to leave mankind a lasting legacy, but realizes in the back of his mind that everything is eventually lost in time. But the real beauty of Watchmen is the moral diversity of its superheroes. Even a second hand recollection of such iconic tunes will suffice. You may like action - packed toy / game inspired or superhero movies, like Transformers or X-Man, where the action has priority over message - or there is no message at all."
6873,"L. Jackson is Great as Afro's Helpful Helper along the way LOL. The refreshing and intriguing combination of blaxploitation, samurai culture, anime and hip hop (soundtrack by usual suspect RZA) that made the first one such an infectiously cool hack - and - slash yarn is pretty much of the same standards but this time it's let down by a silly story and disappointing ending that was clearly not very well thought out. If you've never watched Anime, this will get you hooked! Simply on point with every up and down, RZA did a great job. "" Afro Samurai: Resurrection "" has finally landed on DVD!"
7070,"It was full of laugh - out - loud scenes, with comedy on every level, excellent performances, and a sneaky plot that Scorsese would have been proud of. But to watch Angarano hang ten on his own terms, through his own scenes, was magnificent. And because Hess pays special attention to each character, Hector Jiminez and Halley Feiffer are given equal opportunity to steal the show, and turn hilarious performances. Apparently Hess noticed him long before that, and was able to capitalize on Angarano's rising talent, to have it perfectly coincide with Gentlemen Broncos. Angarano is, as usual, excellent in the lead role in that he manages to play a shy character with little to say while simultaneously holding the viewers' attention throughout."
6852,"Ah, chick flicks, gotta love them, their non-clever formula's and clichÃ©s are always a joy to watch. Emma and Liv are best friends who have planned every detail of their weddings since they first witnessed a wedding at the Plaza Hotel. Now the movie does have some good laughs here and there, but they're mostly shown in the trailer. Well, it looks like their dream is finally coming true as their boyfriends have popped the question and now all that's left to do is book the venue. Apparently, if you're a woman and live in Manhattan, the ultimate dream of your life is to get married at the Plaza in June, so when best friends Liv (Kate Hudson with a Paris Hilton / Britney Spears haircut) and Emma (Hathaway) get asked the fundamental question by their beaus, they immediately try to book the right place and date."
6853,"It delivers buckets of gore, brisk pacing, and a lot of in your face 3D goodness. There is brutality in king size portions, sure to satisfy the most hardcore of horror fans. A film like this is quite refreshing for the genre, not because it is artful by any means, but because it embraces its inherent trashiness. And the 3D was a nice treat."
6857,"The interpretations of Michael Sheen who plays as Lucian, Rhona Mitra who plays as Sonja and Bill Nighy who plays as Viktor were simply outstanding. OVERALL: Underworld: Rise of the Lycans is a great movie to catch. This original and gore - soaked vampires film begins centuries ago. Very effective in this type of movies. It packs large loads of guts and gore, there's a huge body count, this one actually knocks off an immense amount, several vampires and werewolves are staked bloodily in the chest, even more impaled with large claws."
6859,"His Paul Blart is admirable in a way. This kicks off the main action, where Paul must use his resources around him to out think and outrun the criminals while keeping everyone alive. They'll like the film's gentle and goofy humor, and accompanying adults may find themselves charmed by Blart himself. There's plenty of sweetness during the early moments, establishing Paul's shy relationship with Amy, and the caring one he shares with his daughter. He's constantly battling with his own shortcomings and health issues, and it's clever the way he keeps on finding ways to keep himself going, driven by saving the ones he loves."
6862,"There are lots of other more interesting and actually scary movies out there. The performances are able enough with the likes of Matthew Knight, Emi Ikehata, Johanna Braddy, Jadie Hobson and Shawnee Smith. Artistic and suspenseful cinematography have been replaced by bland, formulaic and frightfully comical scenes."
6864,"Coraline (voice of Dakota Fanning) begins a journey of adventure and self discovery when her parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) relocate the family to Oregon from Michigan. All of this immense undertaking is courtesy writer and director Henry Selick, director of Nightmare Before Christmas, and the well crafted adaptation of Neil Gaiman's international best - selling children's novel. To Selick's credit this is the first 3D stop motion ever made; stereoscopic 3D. The style is stunning and the story is an unwavering fairy - tale nightmare that has some genuinely scary moments. Henry Selick's "" Coraline "" is a smart adaptation of Neil Gaiman's extremely popular award - winning novella."
6866,"The story from this movie is developed on Hong Kong and it was an excellent decision to do that, because the exotic taste from that city makes the movie richer, not to mention the obvious possibilities of comparisons with the popular TV series Heroes go down. He puts to this movie a good level of energy and dynamism, but he recognizes the moments in which the narrative requires a more subtle and controlled work. Chris Evans shows energy and conviction on his role; Dakota Fanning confirms she has left behind her past as a mini-adult, for becoming into an excellent juvenile actress; the great Djimon Hounsou brings a lot of style and energy to his character; and Ming Na is also pretty good on her role. watch it for what it is and only for that, because if you are about to start comparing it and trying to find clichÃ©s, rip - offs, etc, you lose what is most important: to enjoy the film, which has nothing to say actually, but it is fun to watch anyway. Push is one of the better modern superhuman - themed movies you will find."
6867,"In short, an entertaining movie that alleviated the February blues. The International provides a breath of fresh air to fans of thrillers. It is a film more in style of Hitchcock with the mystery being the film's guiding force rather than frenetically stitched together action scenes. While being an enjoyable and smarter - than - usual series of action movies they were nowhere near as intricate than their source material, which really dove into some seriously dark territory plot-wise with things that big budget thriller films almost never dare to touch. Movies and stories, at their core, are presenting new ideas and patterns and The International doesn't do that with spectacular action scenes, but with it's fresh plot."
6869,"The cast are all first rate with special attention going to Ben Affleck, who has so needed a good role in front of the camera for ages, and Jennifer Aniston as the couple who can't move forward, also good are Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Connolly in their respective roles. The film of course has a number of elements and outcomes that are extremely predictable (it IS a romantic comedy) but there's enough other stuff in there, and definite surprises at the end, to make it more than just the sum of its parts. Sure there is X likes Y but Y likes Z but Z is married to A. Which is always entertaining. What epiphany did the Justin Long character undergo to realize that he was really "" into "" the Ginnifer Goodwin character? The acting is all pretty faultless, with Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Connelly, Brendan Cooper and Justing Long displaying some of their best work."
6871,"While "" Into the Wild Green Yonder "" isn't the strongest of the four films, it certainly offers up laughs and plenty of the clever, over the top sci - fi concepts that the series is famous for. Fry decides to use his ability to win a million dollars in a poker tournament that Bender also enters to impress his gangsters moll. Bender sells out Leela for money (by bugging Fry's phone) and Fry joins Wongs as a security guard to smash the system from within. Though Bender's big score was a watchable piece the latest two movies were a bore. If you like Futurama you'll likely enjoy this, otherwise hop skip and jump over it."
6875,"Consensus: Expect a fascinating drama with fine acting and a few hearty laughs (if you can handle crude humor). After all, the film stars Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen (who have wonderful rapport), among many other, uh, funny people, and is written and directed by Judd Apatow, the director of "" The 40 - Year - Old Virgin "" and "" Knocked Up . "" She has a husband (Eric Bana, in a truly funny role) and two kids (Iris and Maude, Mann and Apatow's real life children), while George lives a life less fulfilling. Seth Rogen and Sandler have proved to be fine comedic actors, you wince at watching them sell their souls to Jud Apatow. Here is an Apatow film different from anything he's directed, written or produced lately, and deserves to be seen at least once, and while people will see this and perhaps, not laugh as hard, here is hoping Apatow doesn't lose face and give up on this kind of writing."
6877,"That same humor and silliness in the skits is in this movie. A perfect mix of bizarre twists and turns, outlandish situations, and keeping on track with the story to be told. This movie is a comedy, and for what comedies do, it was spot on. The film centers around three young (high school senior) "" detectives "" who've been solving various mysteries (disappearing kitty, stolen lunch, etc.) for a dime a pop throughout their childhood, when they are suddenly thrust into the midst of an honest to goodness real crime investigation. On top of that, there are a several delightful plot twists that you won't see coming."
6878,"When the movie started it was great with Madea, her story, and how she got to where she is now. Some of these scenes question American class division and have a purpose."
6879,"A lot of the antics dealing with these clichÃ©s bring some solid humor, but even more supply forced situations that lead nowhere except for empty laughs leaving an unsatisfying taste in your mouth. He has a doofy charm that gets a couple good laughs but he also makes Burt a loveably doting and comforting boyfriend there for Verona no matter what. First time screenwriters (and husband and wife) Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida waste no time in making them two identifiable people, and in the way they survey life's odd, complicated, and wonderful little moments, "" Go "" never fails at being a funny, thoughtful and heartwarming little gem that you'll fall in love with. John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph shared great chemistry as a couple expecting their first child and trying to decide where to settle down and raise their family. What makes this movie charming and deeper than a lot of romantic comedies is that you already have an established couple that's very much in love."
6883,"Attempting to make the movie funny, the screenwriters concocted a substantial amount of cheap lines, especially politically incorrect dialogue and behavior, for Martin, having him contradict his political correctness mentor Mrs. Berenger (Lily Tomlin) by ogling women and making a bad joke about his "" yellow "" friend Kenji and sushi. Nicole is very beautiful and so is Sonia, who has a sexier look and, for a while, eyes for Clouseau. There were some genuine laughs from time - to - time, plus a great cast (shoulda got more out them). Vicenzo and Chief Inspector Dreyfus (John Cleese) have a few good moments of humor. A great part of the charm of the Pink Panther movies was derived from the exclusively sixties flavour, the vehicles, the fashion and above all the actors who were extraordinarily well cast."
6887,"The Hamburg / Larry Levin screenplay does a clever job poking fun at the double entendres inherent in any modern - day bromance, though one wishes certain characters - Kevin's family members, in particular - had been allotted a little more in the way of screen time. That being said, the performances are all first - rate, with Rudd and Segel playing to their respective strengths - Rudd's of the tongue - tied, self - effacing Mr. Nice Guy who needs lessons in "" manning up, "" and Segel's of the refreshingly blunt but socially indelicate Man / Child who clearly needs to do some growing up. There's additional excellent work from J. K. Simmons, Jamie Pressly, Sarah Burns and Rob Huebel, among others. Finally, some unlikely cameo appearances by Lou Ferrigno and the band Rush, all appearing as themselves, add to the spirit of fun that permeates the film. Since those two films most especially exceeded many people's expectations, Jason Segel and Paul Rudd both probably had a lot of pressure for this film to be funny."
6888,"On the plus side, Roberts and Owen provide two extremely watchable lead characters and are ably supported by Wilkinson and the always good Giamatti. Sure, Owens is swift and good, but Roberts looks fresh off the' Ocean' s' set, with almost zero charisma she was built on in the early 90s. After roughly three - dozen "" two weeks ago, "" "" ten years ago, "" etc, flashbacks, you'll learn Roberts and Owen are capers in love attempting to make a heist (and life) together using their trained skills. He catches up with Claire five years later in New York City's Grand Central Station, but she acts like she doesn't remember him. Director "" Michael Clayton "" Tony Gilroy also has writing credits for The Bourne series, so his credentials are excellent."
6889,"Some of the tender moments between he and his son were actually quite effective from an emotional standpoint. She is prevented from finishing her image, which is actually a series of seemingly random numbers, and goes missing during the ceremony. A fascinating discovery, but more important matters lie hidden in the numbers, as there are three dates and three major disasters to come."
6891,"While thrillers are mostly considered TV material and this one might borderline on that fine edge, it still deserves to be seen on the big screen. Most reviews will obviously comment on Noomi Rapaces outstanding performance as Lisbeth Salander and put her on a well deserved pedestal. Camera work and the overall look of the film is astounding, especially on bluray. The principal characterizations are quite well suited by the cast who fit naturally in the roles they play with great realism. in addition the characters are straightened by a superb cast played by Michael Nyqvist and especially Noomi Rapace."
6894,"It may look like it is a direct - to - DVD movie but it is a lot better than some direct - to - DVD movies. One of the two credited writers (and, as usual in movies, there may be more writers involved) must have been the one to dump a whole bucket of stupid over this script. A little science - fiction thrown in of course, with big assumptions that everything is connected on the world wide grid, and coupled with an ending that would astonish non-techies, but a comedy to nerds."
6895,"What makes Monsters vs. Aliens such an enjoyable film is how it works as a comedy. Hugh Laurie does a fantastic job as the voice of the sophisticated (though mildly insane) Dr. Cockroach, and most of the laughs are generated by Seth Rogen's performance as B. O. B. Even Reese Witherspoon helps you feel some sympathy for her character near the beginning of the film, and Stephen Colbert does a surprisingly solid job as President Hathaway. It's a fun story with fast pacing, entertaining characters and nice 3D effects. Still - make sure you see it in 3D! But it's a treat to see all the nods to '50s classic era of films that Monsters Vs Aliens pays homage to along with some good messages about being true to yourself and looking beyond one's appearance in order to know someone."
8618,"The plot is as with all his screenplays disturbing yet hilarious, isolated yet universal, crazy yet supernormal. all do their best to cater to the flip - flopping whims of their mistress of the house. An example will be like how Heneveld got ordered to have a moustache. And what the fun is in the film, is when these facade get systematically pulled back to reveal the character's true position in the household, and their real family ties, which in summary, can deal with things like potential incest, a sexual predator in the waiting, a fake steady relationship, mutual advantages gained from keeping up the pretenses, and even an extramarital affair all thrown into a heady mix. She has decided to do it with great style surrounded by her own family, who now, are relegated as servants of Emma."
6958,"The cinematography of this documentary is amazing, even the images of pollution of the environment that humans have caused look remarkably appealing to the eye. No wonder Yann Arthus - Bertrand spent 15 years preparing for the production of Home. this is one of the most beautiful documentaries ever made and EVERYONE should make the effort to SEE. Probably one of the best movies of 2009 and one of the best documentaries of the year as well. One of the most brilliant documentaries on one of the most important topics in todays world."
6900,"Plus, he's a major a-hole, to boot. Acting as the any - man for this movie, Ray Liotta ("" GoodFellas "") is LAPD Det. Harrison, who plays cruel jokes on the idiot, such as leaving him in the middle of South Central and gleefully informing him that he was not accepted into the academy. Most of the laughs here were nervous giggles as opposed to the out - and - out belly ones most movies of this ilk illicit. Rogen is excellent as Ronnie Barnhardt, who is rude to most people, yet is still kind of likable and ia infatuated with Brandi (Anna Faris) the blonde makeup consultant, even having sex with her when she's virtually unconscious. Even when they don't work under Apatow, there is real work, wit and earned laughs in what they do, and here is a film that is a perfect example of how elemental film techniques can make a movie funny."
6901,"Anyone who sees this film to relax and enjoy a bit of comedy with a heartfelt story, or to reminisce about their teenage years, their first jobs or their personal time at Adventureland, or even to watch a teenage love story will get what they were looking for. It is a tender, intimate romance surrounded by goofball humor, but the extent of the' dirty jokes' in this movie is Jesse Eisenberg's character James getting out of the pool at a house party with an erection. The screenplay is a funny, poignant take on post-collegiate angst and love, with some elements of social satire, and its focus is one of the most memorable and wonderful romances in quite some time. Em isn't a dolled - up' hot chick' with perfectly styled hair and perfect style, she's moderately well - dressed and naturally beautiful, but wears makeup in a grand total of two scenes, and is actually NOT the' babe' in the film (that's Margarita Levieva as Lisa P, who, though the' babe', is not the sought - after one). They emote, they repress, they do everything a real person does in a relationship to the degree where their characters are so well developed your rubbing your eyes in disbelief like some kind f college screwball comedy."
6902,"No moments of cringe worthy awfulness, and some good cast chemistry. If you love a book never go see a movie (e. g. Atonement) or accept it is going to be completely different. There's a truckload of "" aww "" uttering romance, "" lol "" comedy and it's great for all ages. Confessions of a Shopaholic is a rare gem that's worth the guilty swipe of a maximized credit card. Rebecca Bloomwood is a lovely redheaded young woman who loooooves to shop."
6903,"But it is a surprisingly well - plotted and thrilling puzzle of a movie that has it share of great moments, but the twist can be guessed by most and it changes up the rules of the first two. Like the previous movies, he has the ability to travel back in time to key moments to gain some new information and sometimes even alter the past. Usually movies like this skimp on those elements and just use a cheesy synth score, but this one was solid. Some very nice moments in the film are undercut with overlong scenes and sloppy editing. Soon he is a suspect in the murders that he formerly helped solve and the real killer is closing in on him."
6904,"One of the marketing factor of Dragonball is the fighting style and its creative art of fighting sequence. But studio got to have more faith in selling these stories with huge fans around the world: Dragonball, Akira and whatnot. For manga and anime fans around the world, the story of Dragonball has to be at the top, or at least in the top 3 of their most beloved manga / anime stories ever written. This movie, although aged and not exactly a direct interpretation of the Dragonball story, was still appreciated by most fans due to the comedic entertainment value. The studio spends a lot of money on making Marvels and DC comics into movies, look how successful those films had become."
6905,"When fugitive Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) returns to Los Angeles to avenge a loved one's death, it reignites his feud with agent Brian O'Conner (Walker). This film is filled with full action, fast cars, full of stunts and beautiful women. Gal Gadot is tremendous as Gisele Harabo it was her first role in this film and she was awesome, she acted the character terrific. Don Omar and Tego were hilarious, John Ortiz was good as the villain though not at all threatening, Fenix was just asking to get owned by that car in the end (what a way to go), and seeing Han from Tokyo Drift was a nice little treat. Muscle guys, muscle cars, hot chicks, and incredible action sequences."
6907,"As the ol' war vet Pentagon General, Gandolfini is gruff and verbally abusive in a really mean spirited way, which is glorious. Those with a keen sense of cinema will notice how well the film shifts humor as the Brits come across the pond to the the dry humor of America. Director Armando Ianucci's delivers such a cynical sharp witted look at all things politically ridiculous and it works on so many levels. Fans of British humor will love this, its pureness to the form is perfectly meshed into the political platform that moves the comedy along with merely a few small bumps in the road. One of the best political satirical comedies in years!"
6908,"If you're looking for an evening of pure escapist fun, feeling generally nostalgic and cool about the legacy of the 60s fashion and music, and would like to forget history for a while and go with the party mood, go see this film - you won't be let down and you'll get what you're looking for: an amazing soundtrack (although, as many didn't hesitate to point out, not entirely historically accurate), with the likes of The Rolling Stones, The Kinks, Dusty Springfield, The Hollies, Jimmy Hendrix, Buddy Holly, and many many more, with the charismatic Bill Nighy and a bunch of other not - quite - so - ordinary eccentric characters, more or less familiar to you, depending on how you enjoy British (and American) comedy (e. g. And it's partying in the true 60s sense of the word. Hoffman, and pretty much had little expectations as long as the movie was entertaining - well it was. The superb cast of actors all deliver quite genuine performances, even though it takes some growing into (like the movie) but there's enough sarcastic profanity that doesn't push it over the comfort zone. The basic premise is that if you can pick music from nine years in the most productive periods in popular music, you should have a great basis for a film."
6910,"Since the story has been used so much, a director can only do so much to just do the best they can with, Burr Steers pulls 17 Again out with great laughs and good fun. Every teen generation needs a good body swap / turn the clock back type of story and 17 again is one of those stories, Mike O'Donnell had it all. Right before the game that could make him into a star, Scarlet tells Mike she's pregnant, Mike makes a drastic and life altering decision and runs out of the game to be with her giving up his chances of becoming a basket ball star, now 20 years later Mike's regretting it all and wishes he could do it all over again, and by some miraculous way he does. It proved he is a skilled Actor and his acting brought back memories of Chandler in Friends. With elements of Big and 13 Going on 30, not to mention It's a Wonderful Life and Back to the Future, 17 Again is a pretty enjoyable meshing of those movies considering the cast which has Zac Efron, Michelle Trachtenberg, Leslie Mann, Margaret Cho, Thomas Lennon, and Melora Hardin."
6911,"Underneath lies a subtle political message, because it is again "" the good guys "" killing "" bad Nazis "". The opening scene with Denis Menochet as farmer and Christoph Waltz as SS officer is best part of the movie. Michael Fassbender was great in role of British spy and his character adds some new layer of logic and realism in movie."
6912,"A powerhouse cast, that doesn't disappoint: Russell Crowe, Ben Affleck, Helen Mirren, Rachel McAdams, Robin Wright Penn, Jason Bateman, and Jeff Daniels Though it's Crowe and Helen Mirren as his sparring and quick - witted boss who shine the most, this is essentially an ensemble piece, and it's especially clever when Jason Bateman arrives on screen for a few pivotal scenes as a smug public relations guru who's too dumb to realize he knows too much. With fast paced, edge of your seat story lines, plot twists, political undertones and dramatic personal struggles with morality, nobody did it better than Emeric Pressburger and Michael Powell. Other than the superb cast, one of the most impressive things about State of Play is the script, which was written by Tony Gilroy, Billy Ray and Matthew Michael Carnahan and based on the 2003 BBC mini-series of the same name. She's been here fifteen minutes and she's got enough gear to launch a f *** ing satellite."
7622,"Anders & Wylde work brilliantly together & D. Kerry Prior's script is a great new take on the zombie genre which other film makers should take note of. You really buy into actors Chris Wylde and David Anders as friends and the conversations feel very real. D. Kerry Prior has taken a great concept and through the superb storytelling and visual aesthetics has brought this terrific movie full circle. The two main actors were superb, the storyline coherent, the situations hilarious and what's even bettr: at some points it has some sadness tones to it which makes it even a deeper, richer movie. Someone needs to pick this thing up, it's gold."
6913,"The film closes with a re-creation of the YTV interview with Clough and Revie sitting side by side immediately following Clough's dismissal. Clough had his demons and was a complicated man. He was essentially a dictator, and not always a benevolent one, often punching or slapping his players. While Morgan's script keeps up the dry wit and humour, and Hooper's direction carries the colourful scenery of 1960's and 1970's Britain, the film could have spent more time centred around the other players on the pitch, more specifically Clough's second in - command in Peter Taylor and the Leeds United side of the Revie era. Clough was one heck of a character and very much of his time and this is where' The Damned United' really succeeds."
6914,"His goal - track down psychotic criminal Johnny Vang, who is seemingly parading around Chelios's heart in a miniature cooler, and get it back, so old friend and medical expert Doc Miles (Dwight Yoakam in a returning role as the man who lets the audience know exactly what's going on) can put it back in. The first one managed to take an insane concept and turn it into an enjoyable, over-the-top action movie which would have had Quentin Tarrintino enjoying his QT pants! If this had been part of a trash spoof franchise like the endless Scary Movie / Epic movies etc then at least people could have hired this out at home and injected their heads with glue beforehand to prepare. Here's how funny it is: SpikeTV showed it and of course had to make countless cuts: not just the copious female nudity but the language and graphic violence and so on. Chelios escapes and discovers he has a whole new set of problems - his heart is connected to an external battery pack."
7040,"Some of the songs are genuinely enjoyable. Considering the fact that Rob Zombie has been talking about The Haunted World Of El Superbeasto since before The Devil's Rejects was released, there was some tremendous hype behind this little side project. Now it's not all bad, in fact the acting is quite entertaining and good, especially Tom Papa as Superbeasto, he's so over the top it's hilarious. There was the occasional funny moment here and there, but the excessive use of spoofs (his own films and MANY others) was way overboard. Yes, it's a Rob Zombie movie - meaning that he casts his friends in an overlong music video for a song that has only overstayed its welcome on the classic rock airwaves by thirty years."
6915,"While book racks are brimming with thought provoking, high concept science fiction, the movie genre tends to be populated by invading aliens, intergalactic wars, and adventure, which makes Director and co-writer Duncan Jones' Moon that much more of an oddity. Not since Steven Soderbergh's much overlooked 2002 rendition of Stanislaw Lem's Solaris has a movie firmly rooted in the sci - fi realm delivered reflections on the human condition, which Moon does deftly. It tells the story of Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), the only inhabitant of an automated lunar mining base extracting Helium - 3 from lunar rocks to be shipped back to Earth to fuel the energy starved planet. It takes some inspiration from such classics like "" 2001: A Space Odyssey "", "" Outland "", "" Silent Running "", "" Alien "", and others, but still manages to be unique and original, something which has become increasingly rare in the recent big - budget / massive special effects / quick fix - tradition of Hollywood nowadays. An excellent debut directorial by Duncan Jones, and clearly one of the 5 best sci - fi movies made in the last 10 years."
6916,"This film is the beginning of what will surely be mind - blowing visual effects at the movies this summer. That is not to say the film is entirely devoid of quality, but it is reduced to occasional fleeting moments (sporatic bursts of creativity during fight scenes, a promising African raid plot point, and an undeniably gripping if under - explored sequence of Wolverine going through the Weapon X program). While further focus on the Wolverine / Sabertooth dichotomy could have yielded a narrative volumes stronger, the film continually broadens its scope, seemingly attempting to bank on the in - jokey winks to fans of the comics by hinting at broadening the Marvel universe in further sequels demonstrated in 2008's Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk. Explaining the wars, the differences between Wolverine and Sabertooth, and doing it in a time line that the audience can accept and relate to. Some of the most touching and most moving moments is watching Wolverine trying to fit into a normal life."
8580,"The leads are nice - looking guys, easy on the eyes, but certainly not models. Plan B is a captivating movie about feelings and the struggle to be honest, at least to yourself about them. However, during the course of this film, he becomes very beautiful through the eyes of his friend who reluctantly falls in love with him. Because sexuality is complex by nature and societies made it even more difficult for them to express what they are feeling and Marco Berger knows that. Two other amazing films comes to mind after watching this extraordinary work of art; Alexander Sokurov's Mother and Son and the young and talented Romanian Corneliu Porumboiu's Politist, Adjectiv."
6917,Another noteworthy (relatively speaking) encounter is between her and some guy from L. A. with a wife and kids. Her relationship with her costumers and other professionals who are part of the escort world is built little by little in several out - of - order scenes.
7041,""" Whip It, "" which stars Ellen Page (Juno), Marcia Harden, and several other notable actors / actresses is a fun filled, action packed, emotional film that forces you to give an old fashioned thumbs up as you leave. Page is fantastic in her role, perfectly capturing the rebellious, curious character of Bliss Cavendar. Unlike most "" rise to the top "" movies, Whip It is believable. Ellen Page and Marcia Gay Harden are excellent and the mother / daughter scenes are very real. Ellen Page did all her own stunts - learning to skate which adds a lot to the movie."
6918,"There are great shots of border crossings and always the trains. Even amidst all the doom and gloom of the movie there are some sublime moments of beauty, humanity and yes even hope. Directed by the young talent Cary Fukunaga, a winner of the Sundance Film Festival Directing award, the film focuses on a combination of issues in South America, from involvement of kids and teenagers in Mexican gangs to what it takes for those who decide to leave South and Central America and seek greener pastures in the U. S. The voyage is gripping, showing in researched detail what immigrants go through to overcome this challenge. Something happens, and along with other locals, he tries to escape to America riding the tops of trains that move along the continent."
8543,"Its got a good story line, original songs (in the vein of a good musical are at the appropriate times), it has an excellent diverse cast, Choreography for several of the songs which is spot on for the number, humor (especially perfect in a lesbian tennis scene). Hes a wonderfully typical cute gay guy. The rest of the cast is very diverse and thats just brilliant and so refreshing. The songs were all original, and perfectly placed."
6919,There are just enough seconds truly funny comedy to fit into a comedy trailer. There are just enough seconds of great action in this film to fit into a great trailer.
7641,"So in terms of subjects he is on ground covered by many observational comedians but it is "" how "" he covers them that makes him very funny. He continues to have a great imagination and, while his on - stage wildness has been toned down a little, it remains in his writing and his phrasing."
8542,"All in all it's an entertaining story about that old gay clichÃ© about musicals. In a musical, singing and dancing should be first rate, the story should be engaging and if in fact it is based on clichÃ©, at least it could be original in scope and context, not the same tired venues and story lines that someone would expect from similar projects 20 years ago. The choreography blends a lot of trademark routines from hit shows of the last 40 years. However all the songs are good, everybody can sing and even the dancing is GREAT (the tap dancing angels were just incredible). As a film, "" The Big Gay Musical "" is passable entertainment."
6921,"4) Misleading Scenes and Redundancy: John Woo put his main focus on the characters of Zhou and Zhuge portraying their friendship and intelligence, which totally missed the point of the intricacy of their alliance. Acting is still good with some of their humorous face expressions. It is unique, different from other war movies. With the cast established, their motivations solidified, the stage set and the first volleys already thrown in the original, John Woo is able to just sit back, relax, and make the thoroughly indulgent epic action picture he always wanted in its sequel. This certainly is the best warrior based movie to come out of China, and even for the jaded director John Woo, the greatest masterpiece."
6923,"A lot of the important lines in the book (CERN, Maximilian Kohler, the scepsis of the Swiss Guard, the love relationship between Robert and Vittoria, the Hassassin, the relationship between the Camerlengo and the pope) are lost in the movie screenplay. (9) In the novel, the character of Hassassin was an unforgettable villain. Sound effects and sound tracks were very good. Recruit professional killer to kidnap and kill Cardinals; 5. McKenna is branded; a few seconds later he is giving orders, and a few minutes later, he is running (literally) around in charge of operations--in real life, he would be in shock."
6925,""" Fanboys "" is a movie about, well, fanboys. A valentine to "" Star Wars "" fans, perhaps, it's a film that pokes fun at its core audience without alienating it. There's a wealth of cameos, too, from the likes of William Shatner, Billy Dee Williams, Carrie Fisher, Kevin Smith, Jason Mewes and three (count 'em, three) roles featuring Seth Rogen. "" Fanboys "" has heart, and combined with a solid young cast and hundreds of "" Star Wars "" and other nerdy references, makes it a film worth returning to again and again. Most all of them agree though, that this movie provides some laughs, has decent acting, and is decently done."
7652,"This movie was certainly a movie that would be great to watch with someone you care for, as you will be crying the whole time. Because movies on Lifetime, even the best ones, always pull back from the edge. The film is a very good one as it especially comes to grips with the church's condemnation of the gay life style and the use of the bible to distort this way of living."
6926,"You can't accuse McG of copying Jim Cameron's first two flicks â€” or even Jonathan Mostow's goofy third â€” but you're left wishing he'd perfected his own style before tackling such an ambitious project and producing, as a result, a frustratingly passable action - thriller. Bloodgood is a great example of the movie's ill tendencies â€” sad to say, she personifies them. This future is populated by cute kids, blood - free deaths, supermodels with perfect teeth and goofball terminators that shoot themselves in the foot."
6927,""" Night at the Museum 2 "" sucks the magic out of the original and overdoses on characters as well as meandering sarcasm and awkward humor. Save some bright spots in character acting from a delightful and plucky Amy Adams and some bright spots from Hank Azaria and Christopher Guest, "" Smithsonian "" will disappoint most defenders of the first film--except kids and anyone else who'll bite on an outrageous premise. It might seem like loving Adams is the "" it "" thing, but she brings the imaginative spirit sorely lacking in the film as Amelia Earheart. Ben Stiller is slumming it here, on auto pilot so to speak, and everything just seems so crammed together with not that much heart or effort into it, but the effects definitely were. Hank Azaria is hilarious as Kahmunrah, he stole a lot of the scenes he was in."
6939,"If your someone who seen a lot of movies and get the parodies will find some of it to be very slightly amusing. It makes fun of classic dance movies. A lot of the quotes from the original movies that it was spoofing were kept the same or extremely similar, without much humor really added. Their sitcoms have been hilarious along with most of their movies."
8346,"The way, he created voice impressions of people, including Walter Cronkite, Bill Clinton, Jimmy Stewart, Popeye and others here were amazing. "" Robin Williams: Weapons of Self Destruction "" is a great addition to any fan of either Robin Williams or the stand - up comedy genre in general. Looking back at it, Robin Williams: Weapon of Self - Destruction show early signs where Robin William was heading. "" Robin Williams: Weapons of Self Destruction "" is a hoot. In five minutes, Williams amusingly and thoughtfully discusses wildfires, marijuana, tornadoes, and hurricanes, making easy transitions into each topic."
6934,"The film introduces a very important idea: mentally ill people do better if there is someone, whom they trust, who takes an abiding interest in them. You will have to think out that question yourself, keeping in mind that different people have different reactions to the same medication. P. S. Schizophrenia has absolutely nothing to do with having multiple personalities, or of dichotomies (apparent contradictions). Different states, provinces and countries have different laws concerning this."
6936,"ask Bruce "" Ash "" Campbell and now the lovely A. Lohman). One of the best Horror movies of 2009. It has an idea, a concept, but never is fully developed, unless you think the old fashion, standard cop - outs work), good acting and most importantly, characters that you care about. If you're into Sam's other works, you will greatly enjoy this film as it hits all the right notes and contains many of his trademark moments and nods to his early films. While the majority of the movie is kept on a serious and foreboding level, much like the original "" Evil Dead "", Raimi can't help but throw in elements of the absurd and slapstick during some of the more horrific scenes, thus reducing the tension and echoing the latter 2/3 of the "" Evil Dead "" trilogy."
8164,"The dramatic and creepy story is supported by good performances and worth watching this Hammer film. This is a great wee story with all the trademarks of what made Hammer films so spellbinding in the first place. The tale twists and weaves, there's a number of interesting plot twists and fantastic performances all round especially from Spall who puts more proof in the pudding he is one of the most versatile British actors around. Must obey the rules and do everything correctly or extremely dangerous unspecified results will happen. This inspires the pair, Patrick (Aidan Gillen) and Louise (Eva Birthistle) to start a new life, deep in the Irish countryside, at a village called Wake Wood (what a great name)."
6937,"There's a dog who's the leader of his pack and in menacing beyond measure, until he opens his mouth and gets one of the movie's biggest laughs. The film builds up Carl's backstory heavily in startlingly moving moments that surprisingly were surprisingly kept rather secretive in the marketing for the film. Viewed at the Festival de Cannes 2009 The opening film of this year's festival, and the first animated film ever to have this honour, Up is truly a film for all ages. Great story, great voice talent, great timing, great for all ages. It's nice when a movie hits on all cylinders and elicits such a range and emotional reaction people who don't know each other in a packed room all gasp, laugh, cry, and applaud together."
8147,"Enough good cannot be said of the amazingly honest and heart - wrenching performances of the two lead actors. Another interesting fact is that there are no frequent computers, no cellular phones, it almost makes the story timeless. This film is real just like pure emotions. There is a wonderful tenderness between the two that is communicated simply through body language and fleeting glances. What makes the relationship between Lars and Jimmy even more striking is by having it take place against the backdrop of the intolerant Neo-Nazi organization that both men belong to."
8116,"The characters are very likable and you do identify them from the get go, the women especially the titular character are really beautiful especially. The story is great and does a great job showing wonder womans interaction with the "" real "" world and her relationship with both her amazonian sisters and men. The story also does a good job introducing the mythology of the Amazons. However, on the straight - to - DVD universe, an excellent animated version of Wonder Woman was made. Like some other animated movies made straight - to - DVD (like Justice League: The New Frontier and Superman Vs. Doomsday), Wonder Woman has been made with little resources but a high level of creativity and fidelity to the original comic."
6941,"Kudos to the casting agents for this one--it's fun and lively and moves along steadily to the predictable happy ending, but along the way the dialogue is snappy, witty, and oddly believable. Hard to believe, but it was the great chemistry of the two bromantic leads! They play off each other perfectly, and because they're sharply versed with each other, it's instantly believable that they're also sharply - witted with others. This film is basically about two popular high school football players that have the bright idea to attend cheerleader camp. A good cast who can carry this off with panache and a definite sense of sporting fun - it is part pastiche of sporting movies - all help the time whiz by."
8108,"The acting is terrific (Malik's face tells many stories), the sense of humor is spot - on, Cardinale is simultaneously the scariest and best mother a gay boy could ever hope for, and the whole movie is beautifully directed, especially the scene where Bilal comes to Malik and humbly asks to borrow his shoes, because his own outfit isn't classy enough to get him into a trendy club. This is a loving, wise, subtle, witty, sophisticated, erotic, almost Utopian vision of how life should be, a tonic to all those well - made but often dreary movies about gay life outside the urban gay Meccas of the West. As her gay son, Atonin Stahly, too, is wonderful. As his love interest, Salim Kechiouche seems perfectly fitted for the role."
6942,"Watch it to get out of the rut and repetition of Hollywood, and into some beautiful bayou through some French eyes with the ever enjoyable Tommy Lee as captivating guide who pulls off some good small town tough sheriff moments. TLJ hits Dave Robicheaux on the button. The characters he meets in trying to solve the murders are so true to life that you wonder if the people playing the parts were really actors. While a good old fashion murder mystery awaits you, what is more important, as it is in the novels by James Lee Burke, is the story of Robicheaux. Now if only another movie could be made that also includes Clete Purcell, one of the best sidekicks ever written in a mystery novel series."
8058,"Viewers can expect great action and comedy like the television series. The plot takes place sometime after the Straw Hats pirate crew left Thriller Bark but before arriving at Sabaody Archipelgo just so you get an idea of when is the best time to watch this movie if you're reading the manga. They still do stuff important to the plot, get some funny lines in here and there and them having a few minutes of fighting is better than no fighting at all. Shiki's kingdom is just pure eye candy. Shiki, the only pirate to escape from the underwater prison Impel Down is the main antagonist of the movie."
6943,"Having said that most of the females in the audience also enjoyed it; kind of an equal opportunity movie to offend all sexes equally. Up to that point, Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Justin Bartha, and Zach Galifianakis carried the movie briskly and with real chemistry. Zach Galifianakis, in particular, was brilliant. The acting wasn't very impressive either, particularly that of Zach Galifianakis."
8014,"This lacklustre disaster flick should have been so good: it features tremendously good special effects scenes of 100 - metre high waves tearing through a city, laying waste to anything and everything in their path. Some fade - to - black - at - opportune - moments also came to the rescue of the film, and cheesiness reined comical supreme needlessly as well, though no efforts were spared in others especially the one involving the little girl left in the hotel room, providing that edge - of - your - seat thrills in what would be a literal roller - coaster ride in the last half hour. The director is comfortable using the wide screen format, and does a very good job handling scenes with large crowds of people on screen. The director of this film, J. K. Youn, has been notorious for literally copying American comedy hits of the past and' translating' them into Korean for quick bucks movies. Disaster movies have are part of a big tradition, and any number of them have been effective in their own ways."
6944,"They are amazing and deserve Oscars. Given that the acting was by no means sub par (Dafoe was very good as a husband / psychiatrist torn between his professional disposition and the demons of his relationship with his wife; and Gainsbourg was nothing if not committed to the role of a postnatally depressed lunatic) and the cinematography was at times excellent, it should give you some idea of how bad this movie was. The gory scenes, though sickening, are always important in some way to the main themes of the movie. Of course its scenes of mutilation and have a visceral power, but this is cheaply achieved."
6946,"Though its payoff scenes are as predictable as could be, this entertaining romantic comedy is an effective vehicle sure to please Renee Zelweger fans. Led by a warm & funny supporting turn by Siobhan Fallon Hogan (who channels the local persona even better than Frances McDormand's Oscar - winning stint in Fargo), as her local assistant, a tapioca pudding whiz who spends equal time on scrapping (making scrapbooks) and religiosity, the very cute cast of hayseeds play off hard - bitten Zellweger quite well in a time - honored clash of city smarts vs. folksy wisdom. RenÃ©e Zellweger, Harry Connick Jr. and J. K. Simmons are a pleasure to watch as always, and the lesser known actors such as Siobhan Fallon are excellent too. New in Town is not in the league of the great old movies of Riskin and Capra, but is genuinely amusing and a fine platform for Zellweger to display both physical & romantic comedy skills. Actor J. K. Simmons is under - appreciated, his performance as the wise - cracking Stu is proof that it's only a matter of time before this man gets nominated in the near future."
6947,"This film has the best tag line ever: Ein! The director Tommy Wirkola first got famous in Norway with a movie called Kill Buljo: The Movie, which is a Norwegian parody of Kill Bill. Norwegian director Tommy Wirkola took his cast & crew high up north, for a splatter film in a beautiful and isolated snowy setting. Tommy Wirkola is a clearly talented director and hopefully a promising long career awaits him."
7838,"5/5 This is as close as you can get to perfection, everything was amazing, the only "" flaw "" is the ending but its just so clichÃ© Redline really only does one thing--epic action--and those looking for anything else will probably be disappointed. Added to the story is a nice relationship with JP and Sonoshee, a female racer. The art style, sound effects, animation, story line everything is just so spectacular. The place is just as anarchic and badly - managed as one would expect; upon arrival, JP is accosted by a gang of knee - tall aliens who look like Tweety's sketchy, mutated fugee cousins."
7799,"A small budget, short film, well acted by all, the film puts the story across as a' Fly On The Wall' real life drama and is really put across so very well, that this kind of person: Low life, no connections, loner could so easily do this kind of crime and get away with it, very easy without being ever getting caught. A rather short feature film that was chock full of fine performances and ideas. Peter Ferdinando gives a brilliant performance and carries Tony, realistically, through a wide range of scenarios, from unprovoked arguments, to awkward job interviews. But it's Peter Ferdinando who really stands out here, creating a character that deserves to take pride of place next to other famous filmic serial killers such as Henry, Patrick Bateman, Dr Lecter and Ezra Cobb from Deranged, with a pitch - perfect tone that would, in all honesty, creep you out if you ever met him on the street. Given that the film originated as a short film, these scenes seem like filler meant to bring it to feature length."
6948,
6950,"As for the rest of the cast, James Gandolfini, playing a New York Mayor, is good comic relief, getting jokes about Giuliani, subways, and the Yankees but Turturro and Luis Guzman, playing a disgruntled MTA employee working with Ryder, don't get much to do. Denzel also did a great job as this poor man who just coincidentally was having an average day and now all of a sudden has the added pressure of having lives depend on him. It's easy to watch with actors of Washington and Travolta's caliber at work, but Scott's direction is pretentious and throws out some obligatory action scenes that seem to exist for the sole purpose of padding the time on the way to an expected climax. Gandolfini, Guzman and Turturro all do the good work you would expect from them, although again all are limited by the material. There is a great scene where Ryder puts Walter on trial for the bribe and it leads you to think that these two are going to butt heads in dialogue - driven scenes all day long, exposing each other for who they really are."
6951,"The writing was first - rate intellectual, snappy sparring, even throwing in some literary references in the put - downs. The 1st 45 minutes is WELL worth seeing. BTW, this film was actually shot in Boston and (the Alaska scenes) in Manchester by the Sea and Rockport on the North Shore with digital effects adding snow capped mountains. With characters that are both attractive in personality and looks, this movie stays on the track of the plot - line and has loads of character development. The movie is in no way slow, and compliments it's attributes quite nicely."
6952,"It's f-ing hilarious and you'll really enjoy getting the opportunity to laugh out loud for 90 minutes then go see this. The film keeps itself from being too thoughtful by focusing on the pop culture knowledge of history and blending it with modern societal norms to create comedic situations. There are plenty of scenes that will give you laughs that pass as abruptly as they come and a few that are longer lasting. The Holy Grail, Office Space, Borat, Austin Powers, Happy Gilmore."
6956,"This movie is an instant classic, uncompromisingly inviting the viewer to fill in the blanks while being enchanted and entertained. The Limits are a very different animal: Visually, the potent use of color alone, sets it far apart (Theories on the use of dark orange, anyone?) A laconic buff control freak in service to wise guys methodically inspect, and then eat, the coded messages that arrive at his patio table in matchboxes? The film follows a mysterious man around Spain, where he meets with even more mysterious contacts and exchanges secret messages. "" The Limits of Control "" plays with a lot of established film clichÃ©s, and it teases you with your expectations."
6960,"Allen's return to Manhattan after three stays in London and a wonderful stop - over in Barcelona is yet another niche film. In the jokes department you'll find old standards mocking the French and suggesting kids should attend "" concentration camps "" for the summer mixed with modern humor about the Taliban and Viagra. Sure, there are times when Boris' diatribes run a few lines too long, or when the film stops dead when he is not on screen, but for the most part, this is Allen doing what works best for him. No other director can call himself out on all his personal pratfalls and annoying quirks yet still find a way to endear himself to the faithful who are ever patient with him and his films. This is Woody Allen's best film in years."
6961,"The successful fashion photographer Connor Mead (Matthew McConaughey) is a womanizer without feelings that has casual sex with every possible woman and worships his deceased wolf Uncle Wayne (Michael Douglas). Matthew McConaughey is hilarious in the role of a cynical bachelor and shows a great chemistry with Jennifer Garner. Connor Mead (Matthew McConaughey) a famous photographer that has pretty much slept with a lot of women, some are clients. Now Emma Stone is pretty much a scene stealer as the ghost of girlfriends past, she got some laughs. After being the root cause of his kid brother's wedding being called off, Connor Mead (Matthew McConaughey), a noted womanizer who sees male - female relationships as a strategic game to be enjoyed without becoming ensnared, is visited by the "" ghost "" of the first girl he ever had sex with."
6962,"Depp has oodles of charm and charisma, but he plays Dillinger solely as cool. He was generally considered a hero among the public, as this was during the years of the great depression and Dillinger was seen as someone who steals from the rich man. Many of the scenes are well paced, but in its running time the film feels like a very rushed overview of the final years of John Dillinger. Also, songs from the 30s are played throughout, and most of the time they manage to fit into the story's many montage scenes very well. Then he meets Billie (Marion Cotillard), and they fall in love."
6963,"So, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is entertaining and enjoyable, but certainly not the best animated movie of the year. And if you find a theater near you that has it in digital 3D, go and watch it in 3D, because the action and adventure will excite you even more than it actually does. "" Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs "" is a wonderful and entertaining tale of love and friendship, with adorable characters and witty situations. Manfred and Ellie, the two mammoths, are expecting a baby, and Manfred, who is really happy to become a father tries everything to make his wife more comfortable and happy. The love of Manny with Ellie is very beautiful; the triangle of love among Scrat, the acorn and Scratte is hilarious; the love of Sid with the three dinosaurs is funny and also heartbreaking."
6964,"It wrapped everything up real nice and had a moving ending. For 4 years, Prison Break was the smartest, grittiest, best casted, and best written show on Television. The movie was a return to the shows beginnings and was terrific! The amount of work Michael put into his plan of breaking Lincoln out was brilliant and the way parts of his plan came together was what really made season one a great series. But The Final Break will ruin everything loved about the show and destroy that perfect, yet sad, ending they gave it."
6966,"Everyone did a great job as far as performances are concerned. The performances are good from everyone. Evan Ellingson is also very effective as Jesse, the keeper of Anna's secret and silent presence of strength for the family, watching everything fall apart, trying his best to stay sane and hope it all works out. Cassavetes paints a wonderful scene as fireman Brian watches Anna spend dinner with the other firemen at his station. But, there were also some funny moments, making the movie slightly uplifting."
6968,"Tom (Joseph - Gordon - Levitt) is a wanna - be architect turned professional greeting card writer whose life is thrown for a loop when he suddenly falls for the "" new girl "" Summer (Zooey Deschanel, Almost Famous). Zooey Deschanel is absolutely wonderful in her portrayal of Summer and her quirky personalities. Summer, played by Zooey Deschanel, is fun, beautiful and selfish. Joseph Gordon Levitt is so prime here, the chemistry between he and Zooey clicks perfectly and not only that but since every woman, man and child is in love with the knee bending powers of Ms. Deschanel it must be said that JGL gives such a strong performance that he clearly owns this movie all the way till the very end. In 500 amazing days Tom will learn about relationships, reconciliations (a good Ex never dies), Love, Lose and most importantly about moving forward."
6970,"For many, it will definitely be more shocking than Borat, given the shamelessly explicit content that exploits every possibility for jokes concerning men making out. It will once again lead to lots of controversy and imitation at thousands of workplaces around the globe. But packed into those few minutes you will find all the best scenes from the film, and there's very little worth watching in the remainder. Baron - Cohen has always looked for comedy in breaking the boundaries of social convention, and with Ali G and Borat that was often to great comic effect. There were funny moments, of course, Cohen is a funny man, but this movie lacks the bite Borat had."
6973,"At the end of the movie the audience should be lamenting Dumbledore's horrific death, but the movie moved so fast it was hard to truly wrap your mind around one scene before another began. In short, this film is great if all you took out of the book was the romance and funny bits. So, basically, the movie was more like a 99 percent Ron - and - Lavender - and - Hermione love triangle than a Harry - and - Ginny or a Harry - and - Dumbledore - and - memories sort of thing. The last 30 minutes, like the 5th movie, is the best part, IMO. A rock concert tribute to Dumbledore."
6977,"Like Brazil, Adventures Of Baron Munchausen, Fisher King, Fear & Loathing In Las Vegas and Tideland (even Time Bandits really) there is so much going on here that expectations or reputations get in the way and make it hard to digest and appreciate on a single viewing. The fact is the film is at it's best when galloping around the fantastical worlds of the Imaginarium, with Ledger's character Tony now played by Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell. She puts a lot of professional actresses (no Keiras named!) Like DiCaprio in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? And yet on further viewings Bridges' performance seems superb, Willis' perhaps the best of his career."
6980,"If you were still interested or if you're a horror fan that is able to look past some clichÃ©s and logical jumps in exchange for horrific chills, you'll have a fun time. Too many people now enter the film trying to figure out the "" secret "" before they normally would have been surprised), but rather to see a well - acted (extremely well acted by Vera F.) slow - building suspense story with excellent direction and cinematography. Where the problems come in is with motivation and plot depth. The movie also has several sub-plots that work very well in the movie and add some complexity to the whole thing."
6981,"His callous nature and unwavering ability to say exactly what is on his mind breaths life back into Abby's show despite the trepidation of lowering herself to the kind of television she has always abhorred. She agrees to his helpful advice and if he can get her the man she wants, proving his theories on relationships, she will work happily with him, but if Mike fails, he agrees to quit; he successfully guides Abby to be exactly what Colin would want. And Katherine Heigl is once again perfect doing comedy. That said, the cast is really delightful, for Heigl and Butler make a most attractive. Acting is great, story is great and the chemistry between Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler works very well on screen."
6984,"Does "" Aliens in the Attic "" have content the parents would enjoy? All of the kids do a great job, and the voice talents behind the aliens bring a lot of personality to those characters in only a few scenes. "" Aliens in the Attack "" is an underrated and funny family entertainment. There are a handful of moments in this film that had the entire audience laughing uncontrollably. Probably most of the criticisms one can read in the other reviews have merit."
6985,"particularly in the earlier scenes in the film, which feel rather rushed, and seemingly at odds with the realistic documentary feel it was going for. Thank you Jackson and Hollywood for finally producing the best Sci - Fi in years. After seeing his masterful Lord of the Rings saga, anyone can see that he knows what he is doing. Neill Blomkamp brings to screens a fantastic, gritty, realistic piece of science fiction with District 9. but Sharlto Copley (in his debut performance) is a revelation and one of the most memorable aspects of the movie."
6986,"Twenty years after writing her best screenplay so far, When Harry Met Sally. In the meantime, combining it with her writing talents, she has directed a string of movies, including her commonly most acclaimed film Sleepless in Seattle, as well as seriously under - appreciated, though oddly amusing lineup of eccentric characters, brought together in the movie Mixed Nuts, remade from its French original. Ms. Streep's acting is great as always, this time even aided by the physical grandeur of her greater - than - life on - screen persona, undoubtedly achieved by means of never visible pair of platform shoes, providing that she's impersonating genuinely tall person, as real Julia Child apparently was. humor was one of the driving forces of the film, but that didn't take away from some more serious moments - rather, it accentuated them and made them all the more poignant and even heartbreaking. Ms. Adams, likewise, was superb as Julie Powell, a government worker who decided to tackle Julia Child's 500 + recipes in her groundbreaking cook book in a year's time while documenting online the whole process in a blog."
6987,"However, if you take the movie for what it is, you'll see that it's truly the beautifully crafted action - adventure every kid longs to experience and captured within the mysticism and excitement of a good space story using just enough cgi to compliment the film, without overpowering it's actors as so many movies do today. You know, Aliens are good, men in black are bad, action, chase, environment message, yada yada. Hollywood has enough dough to continuously churn out effects laden science - fiction movies, and most of them are big budgeted action fests like Independence Day and Men In Black, which don't exactly paint a good picture of the extra-terrestrials. Dwayne Johnson (formally known as the Rock) takes over Eddie Albert's part as the earthman who befriends the two young aliens, the difference is that Eddie Albert could act a lot better! Race to Witch Mountain being Disney fare means the toning down of practically everything to ensure that it is safe for the entire family to experience together."
6988,"No more are the soldiers "" Real American "" heroes (though that iconic phrase still managed a mention), and a more inclusive (but still token in a way) United Nations type best - of - the - best elite troopers get invited to this highly classified unit blessed with unlimited budget for high tech weapons and toys. Forget the excuse of a story just to link up the big set action pieces, and it is precisely in the action that Sommers understood when to show restraint, add in a dash of humour, pepper it with proper camera angles, though of course still unable to buckle the trend of slowing things down just before any impact. G. I. Joe was much better than expected as pure entertainment, and you really shouldn't give this a miss as it might just restore your faith in big - action summer popcorn flicks that takes a huge leaf out of their cartoon counterparts. Basically, if you like the aforementioned movies you will probably enjoy this one. Enter Stephen Sommers, who had a couple of box office successes with the action - adventure genre in The Mummy movies, so this guy obviously knows what he's doing, and it shows."
6989,"Nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at this year's Sundance Film Festival, Cold Souls is a unique take on the human soul. This film is one part Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, one part Being John Malkovich, and one part originality. It's an interesting story with some nice solid performances by Giamatti, Strathairn, as well as Dina Korzun (the soul trafficker) and Emily Watson as Giamatti's wife. Everything is presented in a deadpan comic way. The souls stored in their foot long glass jars vary greatly, some looking like creative sculptures and others like, well, a jelly bean."
6995,"This type of layered comedy is known from Anchorman, Caddyshack, Step Brothers, Super Troopers, and Chappelle's Show, so if you liked those then you will be able to appreciate all of the funny lines and jokes from the varied and great cast and all of the humorous details carefully interwoven into this film. Will Ferrell was amazing as a character more crass than ever before and veteran actors Alan Thicke and Ving Rhaymes surprise with their character - breaking roles. Ving Rhames plays his role with audacity, as do both Kathryn Hahn and David Koechner, all three exceptional comedians in their own right. One of the funniest sequences, however, concerns a crowd rioting when Eric Bice (brother of "" American Idol "" contestant, Bo Bice) fails to show up at a concert and Ready tries to take his place. First off this is a great role for Jeremy Piven, very much in Ari Gold - form as Don Ready, a car salesman - for - hire who travels around America with his crew helping out lackluster dealerships."
6996,"There's an excellent introduction using the story of Le Petit Prince (The Little Prince) by Saint - ExupÃ©ry as a metaphor. People associate mental disability with physical impairment, and because there is none with Asperger's (except sometimes clumsiness, or "" gangliness ""), for a lot of people it just doesn't register, even though there are defined and recognisable developmental symptoms. The adjectives used to market "" Adam "" include: romantic, funny, delightful, poignant, uplifting, humorous. "" Adam "" is a tumultuous romantic relationship story centered on a young man with Asberger's syndrome. This is one of the most complete films in terms of quality of writing, direction, and overall superb technical film - making."
6998,""" The Time Traveler's Wife "" never makes pretenses to the science behind it, rather it centers its focus on the story. At the heart of this film is a love story and the complexities that people bring to their relationships. The scenes between Henry and young Clare were especially moving because they took literally the notion of feeling like you have known someone your whole life. It's kind of like when you share stories from your past with friends and significant others, retelling them time and again until your experiences are indistinguishable from theirs, except in the case of Henry and Clare, the experiences are real if not linear. Other than that, the two leads were solid and the movie is entertaining."
6999,"So on one hand, you crafted some mindshare into the object of your desire, and on the other, you've made a slew of enemies ever ready to bay for your blood. So it becomes one crazy night for Denis Cooverman (Paul Rust) and his best friend Rich (Jack Carpenter) who has to battle his school reputation of being gay, while getting acquainted with Beth (Hayden Panettiere) and her posse Cammy (Lauren London) and Treece (Lauren Storm) when they turn up for his un-happening graduation party, before proceeding to show him and Rich what could possibly be the wildest night of their lives, especially for the nerds. Panettiere would be familiar to fans of TV series Heroes, and her cheerleader is sans powers except that her Beth drives her car like a maniac and managed to stay alive at such throwaway recklessness. When a geeky high - school valedictorian throws caution to the wind by expressing his love for a popular cheerleader during his graduation speech, life finally starts to get interfering for Denis Cooverman who may have brains to spare; it's guts that he lacks, or at least, he did until today. But Beth's meat head boyfriend Kevin is none - too - pleased that his high school prize is mingling with the biggest dweeb in school, and when Kevin shows up at his house and tears the place apart in a fit of rage Denis, his best friend Rich, Beth, and her friends Cammy and Treece all pile into Beth's car and flee for their lives."
7001,"Whatever it is, G - force is fun with 3 - D. Kids would like the cute animals coming near them. They want to see the funny guinea pigs do funny things. But as usual, Disney movies now are getting haters around the world due to its popular teens and live - action animals - talking movies. The guinea pigs are drawn to be very cute and lovable, and the audience is effectively drawn to root for them. The storyline was fast paced, the animation and effects superb and the guinea pigs were generally funny."
7007,"She always had good grades in school and in College, and now that she is graduated, she is certain that she will get a job as assistant editor in the publishing house Happerman & Browning, in L. A. 1/10 with 2, 128 votes) is an evidence of the foregoing statement. Alexis Bledel, from "" The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants "", is one of the most beautiful actresses of the younger generation and the role of Ryden Malby seems to be tailored for her. The Brazilian Rodrigo Santoro and the unknown Zach Gilford have good participation as romantic pairs of Alexis Bledel. This movie is harmless enough, but the only thing that makes it more worth your time than something from the straight - to - DVD bargain bin in the supermarket (or maybe this WAS one of those films) is a crazy and admittedly pretty funny performance from Michael Keaton as Bledel's doofus father."
7009,"The winding pathways through the side venues of jewelry, art, a class for this and a political table for that. Building a sweet coming - of - age comedy around a major American cultural event of the Sixties,' Taking Woodstock' is lodged on the periphery of the legendary half - million - strong August 1969 "" peace and love "" rock concert held on Max Yasgur's 600 - acre dairy farm near the hamlet of White Lake, in the town of Bethel, New York. , the event "" voice "" echo'd in the acid trip of Demetri Martin, the young son who blunders into inviting the event to White Lake."
7010,"One sequence has Dr. Loomis appearing on a talk show alongside Weird Al Yankovic, with the famed disc - joker lampooning the doctor and Michael Meyers (making puns about whether this is the same guy who starred in Austin Powers) until Loomis finally explodes with anger on air at the hosts assertion that Meyers is a shark. As well, Meyer's is followed by his deceased mother, himself in child - form and a gigantic white horse, seemingly all figments of his imagination."
7011,"Clocking in at a brief 79 minutes (72 minutes if you take out the end credits), "" 9 "" will take your imagination and put it into a world that will make you want for a sequel. Imagine, if you will, a strange but beautiful lovechild of The Borrowers, Voodoo, Alien, Corpse Bride and War of the Worlds; and you have 9. This movie reveals new surprises every time you watch it. And it would be hard to create nine full - blooded personalities with back - history involved in a complex plot in only 80 minutes. It is haunting, thought provoking and beautifully animated and would have scored a 10/10 if it had just been written more towards older viewers."
7020,"The support cast is perhaps a bit too full of well - known faces but everyone is good, working again with the approach. Coming to it on its own terms however this is an engaging story told with a comic air that works and makes the film as entertaining as it is interesting. STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning The true story of Mark Whitacre (Matt Damon) who worked for a giant firm that produced lysine chemicals in products to be consumed by humans. While some of the darker elements have been left out and the film is undoubtedly lighter than its source material, Soderbergh stayed true to reality, keeping the events mostly accurate to what Eichenwald described in his book, and hence, to what really happened; in fact, on a side note, after seeing the movie, the real - life Mark Whitacre commented that the film was "" very accurate "", which is a bit of a surprise considering Soderbergh made the decision to not consult any of the people involved in the actual 1990s investigation. Even though he had not met the person he was portraying before filming, he perfectly captures Whitacre's personality, mannerisms and attitude, making him seem larger - than - life but at the same time, completely and utterly human, while many other actors might have made him too much of a caricature."
7013,"The acting is spirited, especially with Chris O'Dowd and Marc Wooton who both show a lot of spontaneous boyish charm that make their characters appealing. Even though just about one of the three central actors has had major exposure on British TV and more recently, cinema, the performances are pitch - perfect. With some spot on performances and a tight script, Frequently Asked Questions is a smart and very funny take on the science - fiction genre that mixes situation with character humour effectively. Anna Faris delivers a great performance as she sparks the silver screen with her natural abilities of a comedian and all the other actors such as Chris O'Dowd, Dean Lennox Kelly etc. both interacts realistically with each other, forming brilliant chemistry."
7014,"Haneke's Dorf, whilst having an individual character, is a relative of Von Trier's Dogville in the sense that it stands for a larger set of national values. In this respect Haneke seems to be diagnosing German society in the run up to the' Great' War as one of authoritarianism, religious doubt, intolerance, and fear. One of the most moving scenes in The White Ribbon is when a young child brings his father, a Priest, a caged bird he has nursed back to health. As might be expected, love in this town is restrained and uneasy, while incest and affairs are overlooked by villagers. Haneke observes mostly psychological, educational and religious roots of Nazism while leaving economic aspects mostly in the background."
7016,"If you liked Aliens and Resident Evil. It had some nice "" seat jump "" scenes, and had moments where it was surprising funny. And lots of nice twists too - don't see that enough in movies in general any more! Echoing such luminous sci - fi classics as 2001 and Alien, Pandorum is a terrific psychological thriller, although it does struggle at times to be coherent and original. As with the best deep - space movies, the context is mental illness, what the Professor on Gilligan's Island called, oddly enough, "" island madness . """
7017,"The cast is fun but reeks of pre-sales needs. Audiences will be able to see it again in years to come with more objectivity and appreciate it much more. The Men Who Stare at Goats is a very hilarious movie, with many quotable lines and excellent acting by the entire cast. As far as the comedy goes - this film was primarily marketed as a comedy - there are some genuinely funny moments! Men Who Stare at Goats is absurd, odd, hilarious, amusing, definitely original, possibly good and not at all what you would expect."
7019,"It plays off of the emo trend to create ironic humor, and the laughs come in when you least expect them. It's a great throwback to the cheesy, yet fun 80's horror films, only with a bigger budget. Amanda Seyfreid's geeky, yet undeniably dynamic performance often made many highlights for the movie. It's a deliberately cheesy and darkly comic movie that definitely harks back similar movies from the 80s. The performances of both are worthy of accolades."
7039,"He has also been greatly influenced by classics like ROSEMARY'S BABY, WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE and near - Cult Classics like IT'S ALIVE! Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en EspaÃ±ol, are most welcome! When a car accident takes the lives of her husband and Grace, she is still determined. A dark, dramatic tale of horror, "" Grace "" is a creepy, understated ride rife with social commentary, Black Humor, and excellent performances. Also notable is the subversion of motherhood-most movies look at the idea of having a child as a joy, yet here in horror tradition, it is a burden, but not the type one would be used to in horror flicks involving infants."
7021,"If you can view this without any expectations you may find that is a quite remarkable film and definitely deserves a rating higher than 7. Still, this is a slight recommendation or at least a rental and it is still worth seeing because it's still far better than some of the other comedies that are coming out these days. Ben Affleck's character, an obvious rehash of Deidrich Bader's character from the same movie, is the one saving grace, and even he isn't good enough to stop this from becoming nothing more than a mediocre comedy that's best saved for a DVD rental. the cast is very good, story is not boring or cheap; comedy is neither vulgar nor downright stupid; at ~ 90 minutes it doesn't bore anyone and it has a happy ending! The plot itself isn't as interesting or ambitious as "" Office Space "" or "" Idiocracy "" respectively, but the terrific casting and low - key performances keep "" Extract "" charming even when its story falters."
7022,"What this movie is really about is killing young, attractive individuals in a manner which will compliment the 3D. FD1 had Seann William Scott & Kerr Smith, FD2 has Ali Later & FD3 had the immensely talented Mary Elizabeth Winstead. While the very first movie had a spectacular, and some say too realistic for good taste in having witness from within a plane break up and explode upon take - off, this one had an adrenaline pumping race that got enhanced thanks to the latest gimmick in town, 3D."
7023,"C. Hall is a hoot to watch and the singing and dancing scene was hilarious and genius in a movie like this. The movie being "" abstract "" worked very well for everything besides the slayers sequences, but those were surprisingly short."
7024,"Entire illustrations are recreated for the movie with stunning nods to Ron Barret's artwork. Anywho, in a desperate attempt to prove his worth to his father, he invents a machine that turns water into food. It had an ADHD spirit with wonderfully over-the-top characters. Regardless, the animation was stunning, combining a tribute to Ron Barret's amazing illustrations in background with pleasantly cartoony characters. It was creative, extremely fun, and paid reference to everything from "" Independence Day "" to "" The Twilight Zone ""."
7026,"If you love real art in horror, or are a fan of Oldboy - don't wait for the video, see it immediately. If you have seen Wook's previous works / movies you know he is very visual (in a good way) and it shows again here. ' Oldboy' director Park Chun - wook returns with what must be one of the yuckiest and at the same time most serious vampire flicks in movie history. Nevertheless, that is offset to some point by the interesting story, the perfect control Park has over his actors and the visual style with which he creates attractive images and moments of an intense emotional strength. Park Chan - Wook has incredible style, but his movies don't all share the SAME style!"
7031,"World's Greatest Dad is a comedy for adults: insightful, original, uncomfortable at times. "" World's greatest dad "" is one of the best movies of the year. They amplify each characters ego and traits to the point it is cartoonish but it works very well in this film, as well as South Park. So when, as in this movie, he plays someone who is sweet and kind and weak and crawling through moral quicksand, the resulting conflict you feel has you laughing out loud and wringing your hands with anxiety all at the same time. The plot is original and comes with a couple of unforgettable twists."
7034,"The story of the movie moves along at a good pace, and you never really guess what is going on until it happens. Just go watch it with this notion in mind that it is a Rajnikant style action film but made in Bollywood with Salman Khan taking on whatever comes in his way and you shall then be entertained. this look suits salman very well. is a story that will not be new to most regular bollywood movie watchers the twist is very good. Salman Khan has suited the role very well and it makes it a change to see him in action after a long time, though he does remove his shirt, while Ayesha Takia, has improved once again."
7035,"You will find all those dolphins you love are not happy. The film was made with great risks involved and all who took part in making it have to be commended for their courage and desire to show the truth. This film opens your eyes to the truly devastating fates of thousands of dolphins, who are slaughtered without remorse. What also added that emotional weight to the film, is the inclusion of Richard O'Barry, who could be infamously credited with sparking the interest in dolphin - aquariums and shows around the world, simply because of his involvement in the Flipper television series, where he had responsibility in capturing and training 5 dolphins used for that successful series, and henceforth spawned an industry of sorts where dolphins are captured en masse by confusing them and leading them into man - made traps, then allowing trainers around the world to come and choose those with potential. 23, 000 dolphins are due to be hunted and executed starting in September, what will you do to stop it?"
7036,"**** SPOILER ALERT ****** Several reviewers have commented on physics representing logical certainty. Modern physics strikes at the very heart of faith, mystery and law The dybbuk! She believes that the world is filled with mysteries, and her faith in this leads to decisive action--saving them? In the example Schroedinger published in 1935, a cat is in a box with a "" diabolical apparatus "" which kills the cat if a random subatomic particle decays. Even the friggin' parking lot is a divine miracle!"
7037,"But there's a surprisingly strong current of emotion too in a finale that argues secrets are probably best revealed when you feel least safe in doing so. As the writing behind the big finish shines through, so does the believable mix of fluctuating emotions exhibited by the cast. A few too many "" dems "" and "" dose "" may lace his New York accent but he is funny, sincere, frustrated and perseverant in a wide panoply of scenes with actors who have either been TV - type cast (Juliana Margulies), indie - film type cast (Emily Mortimer) or not yet had a real chance to really strut their stuff (Steven Straight, Dominik Garcia - Lorido, and a promising Ezra Miller). The plot was funny and moving, although you could see most of the punchlines and dramatic moments coming from a mile away. It has the feeling of comforting familiarity, and yet is surprising at EVERY moment, taking your expectations and turning them in the most interesting and unique ways."
7038,"This is far better than anything at the theaters now a days and was so well done in every aspect of it. It's not a masterpiece, but it's really quite well done, despite some fairly weak acting (in some places it's downright cringe - worthy.) It was all add - libbed during post-production - amazing considering you couldn't tell at all during the film. A very ambitious project for such a low budget, it has a large cast, many locations and very effective visual effects. More importantly, it has an interesting and inventive story line, memorable characters inhabited by capable performances and a great pace to the editing."
7042,"And those moments are worth the price of admission alone. The film does have a one of the more sweet and quietly powerful scenes where Mark creates an alternate afterlife for his mother. All in all, not a classic movie, but a much better way to spend one's day than many of the other movies out there today. If one were to score this movie on a category - by - category basis, some of the categories might be laughability, cinematography, acting performance, direction, originality, script writing and social impact. The funny parts are really funny, and the sad parts are really sad."
7044,"Second is the way the movie creates this amazing - looking world of a future inhabited mostly by surrogates. All in all, SURROGATES is one of those good sci - fi movies that will simply entertain those who are fans of smart sci - fi movies. If you allow yourself to buy in to the bizarre concept of living life through android duplicates, then the film works on a few levels. They work, play and travel via their surrogates, from the comfort of their home. "" Surrogates "" is the latest of these concepts and surprisingly one of the more well thought - out ones."
7045,"None of the character are able to catch your attention and involve you in the story, although Omari Hardwick (playing a drug dealer wanting out of business) does his sincerest best to bridge the script shortcomings. As can be expected it is a mix of unabated comedy with brutal gangsters, fast talking criminals and crazy sequence of events ending with a grand showdown finale to tie all the separate plots and characters together. Some may enjoy this sort of comedy, but it just tries to show more of the black foolishness similar to Tyler Perry's movies, but at least Tyler Perry's movies are sometimes funny this is not. And yes, of course director Benny Boom tries to elicit the most realistic or "" believable "" acting performances possible from such film veterans as Mike Epps, Mos Def, and Debbie Allen, all of whom appear in NEXT DAY AIR. The best thing about "" Next Day Air "" is that director Boom doesn't wear out his welcome."
7046,"After dropping you in the action right from the start, the movie keeps coming with constant laughs and good action. Jessie Eisenberg's nerdy, insecure' Columbus' character and Woody Harrelson's redneck zombie - killing' Tallahassee' play very well off each other and provide plenty of memorable moments. There is also one unforgettable cameo that had most of the audience rolling in the aisles. Indeed, if you go to this movie expecting a lot of plot twists and surprises, you're going to be severely disappointed. There will no doubt be a lot of comparisons to "" Shaun of the Dead "", which is nothing to be ashamed of, but this is truly a one of a kind movie experience that holds its own with any not only any zombie movie in recent memory, but with any comedy so far this year."
7047,"It's worth a watch on Telly or DVD that's for sure, it passes the time well. and ORLANDO, FL Here's a sure bet: Out of millions of IMDb NF users, only a handful have ever been to Antarctica! A hostile environment provides a great backdrop for an Action / Crime / Drama / Thriller (IMDb genres) such as WHITEOUT. 2 completely different audiences and intents, but both great movies that deliver what they try to deliver. Any comments, questions or observations, in English or EspaÃ±ol, are most welcome!"
7048,"Back to a time that maybe didn't even exist quite like this - well - composed, carefully picked colors, spotless suits and vibrant jazz joints. The heroine, Jenny, swept into the mess, is played with predictable delicacy by Carey Mulligan, and in a surprise she is really a great supporting role, of sorts, for Sarsgaard, even though she is the star. There's a squirmy pleasure in observing her scenes with Peter Sarsgaard, and David is a good role for him. The two lead characters are played with perfection by American indie star Sarsgaard (Kinsey, Jarhead, Garden State and Orphan) and newcomer Mulligan, however it is the latter that steals the show. - It shows that even people with a higher education can have completely absurd views."
7058,"This movie had all the historical ingredients to be a great film, and it instead falls back into the same old bland dialog and formula plot that sinks so many biography movies. Offers no real interesting insights into this extraordinary woman - not even her mysterious disappearance. As an aviation spectacle, the film definitely works because this is a love story of one woman with flying, not one womans love story with George Putnam or the other' chap'! Amelia Earheart clearly flew at a time of aviation transformation and full credit to her for what she did in her life, whether she was foolhardy or not, she died doing something she loved. Plenty of biographies have been written about Ms. Earhart already, the facts belong there."
7050,"Joey (Favreau) just wants to get off; Shane (Faison Love) wants to pretend he's young and also avoid the pain of his divorce; Dave and Ronnie (Vaughn and Akerman) go along because they're good sports. One minute there are mature, real life moments that firmly fit into the "" funny because it's true "" category, the next there are gags revolving around untimely erections and masturbation that would be right at home in American Pie. Have you ever had the feeling someone is trying to lecture you on something you have a far deeper and better understanding of? The storyline is as tired as old leather, but there are just enough witty remarks to keep this trite comedy drifting along. A few good laughs in an otherwise mediocre script and a movie that isn't quite sure of its target audience."
7053,"One who greatly admires filmmakers will wait especially for a filmmaker who takes his time in creating something after years of speculation. If you don't know the story by Sendak - and to be fair it's only several pages long and its story was * loosely * used for this film - is about Max, who, not entirely pleased with his life in the real world ventures into the world of the' Wild Things', a place where he can be king (or rather makes himself one) and tries to create a paradise with his fellow creatures. As soon as you can open up yourself to these being real beings, not just animatronics, the whole emotional core of the film opens up as well. Eggers and Jonze add so much depth to the tale, creating a world and life for Max, (Max Records), to take for granted. The art direction is phenomenal and the use of practical effects meshed with CGI, (mostly in the faces), provides a sense of realism that fully computerized beings never could."
7059,"Mary & Max is one of these films that comes as a complete departure from all the others, both in visual and storytelling style, and sticks in the mind because of it. The way the film handles his Asperger's Syndrome just feels different to how you'd normally see such an issue handled on screen. The use of gray colour with a splash of red when showing the scenes with Max, was very effective, and give the audience the sense of what Max was feeling. After 5 years in the making it is definitely worth watching This amazing claymation touches upon an unlikely friendship between two pen pals: a young girl living in Australia and an aging Jew from New York."
7060,"The interviews at the end with the people who lost their jobs explaining that it was family and support that brought them through bad times hit a perfect note for bringing both parts of the story together. what a great idea for a film (based on the book) but everything you'd want to see in it, they leave out. Surely such move deserves accolade because it's quite uncommon element of Hollywood movies when love story line ends tragically. Along the way, he and the recent college grad, of which the boss loves due to her budget slashing game - changing idea, Natalie, played by Anna Kendrick, both find out what has been lacking in their lives and how to become better people, opening up to love, heartbreak, and the need to grow up. Every single actor is unforgettable â€” even the bit parts like Zach Galifianakis and especially J. K. Simmons as two corporate employees who's jobs have been eliminated."
7061,"The vocal performances were all good as well so there's certainly no problem here. between this and the film, the film is a very unpredictable script to it, but this is far more interesting, Mutant pumpkins from outer space! Part homage to the movie Gremlins, this half hour special has lots of quirky humor and thrills as well as references to adult classics (think theme from Halloween and Psycho) that keeps the pace zipping along. The characters are still as likable as they were in the movie, and the writing is witty and funny, right from the dialogue, the physical jokes to the references to adult movies, making it accessible to adults as well as children. It tells how people prepare for Halloween, and the plentiful Halloween themes and decorations make the short animation appear very festive."
7062,"Here, directors Yoshihiro Nishimura (who tread similar ground with Tokyo Gore Police) and Naoyuki Tomomatsu have crafted both an emotionally - charged teen love story and a hilarious satire of popular trends, the film elevated by the over-the-top absurdities rather than reliant on them. The characters at their best, particularly Monami and Mizushima, are surprisingly fleshed out, likable and quite funny; at their worst, over-the-top caricatures that are usually funny and always interesting. If you enjoy state of the art effects and CGI, then you should not be watching the Japanese gore movies. Naoyuki (STACY) Tomomatsu and Yoshihiro Nishimura, the man responsible for 2008's high - octane action / splatterfest TOKYO GORE POLICE, return to their signature pressurized blood sprays with VAMPIRE GIRL VS FRANKENSTEIN GIRL - a markedly different but equally entertaining romp that provides nitro - fueled action, over-the-top humor, and piles of gore that look like they belong in an early Peter Jackson flick. The plot is goofy, yet endearing, as sweet young vampire Monami falls for Mizushima, "" the only acceptable boy in school . """
7063,"Thinking back, it's actually quite surprising that it took five sequels to get to a trap where loan sharks are forced to contend with Shylock's infamous demand of "" A pound of Flesh "". Longtime series editor Kevin Greutert moves to the director's chair for this entry and his experience with the franchise shines through. The sets still look like those of a movie made for about a million dollars, the actors are mostly second rate and the logic is tenuous within a real world scenario. As far as VI goes, there are SEVERAL twists and turns, and its exciting to see the spirit of the first trilogy back in the last film of the second trilogy. Longtime series editor turned first time director Kevin Greutert has recharged the series and injected something these films have lacked since the beginning: humor."
7064,"If the rehearsals could be this good and engaging, one could only imagine what the concerts would've been. The intimacy of this footage makes you feel, not like you're in a concert, but like you're witness to very private performances. That will say more than anything else about how well done this movie is. The talent, from the dancers to the musicians to the lighting and effects crew were just first rate all the way. His voice and his dance moves are top form and timeless."
7065,"None other than JK Rowling was a big fan of this series so comparisons to Harry Potter were made very soon. One day he and his best friend Steve go to a real freakshow, where they meet vampire Larten Crepsley. While a good bit different than described in the books, his portrayal of Mr. Crepsley was at least entertaining to watch. Because when Darren, Crepsley and Little Creature Harkat travel to Vampire Mountain, that's when the real fun begins! Reilly really delivers in the role, being witty and slightly scary in the as Crepsley."
7066,"Various aspects of the movie are entertaining, amusing, or saddening, depending on how one views them. It's also interesting to see a "" hair show "" where hair stylists have these crazy elaborate, very entertaining demos of their skills. His search brings him to a hair convention in Atlanta, a barbershop in Harlem, a temple in India and many other interesting places. "" Good Hair "" is like a Halloween ride of shallow caricatures of people who has no sense of reality."
7067,"one of The Last Great Movie Palaces). The film features a cast full of what's his faces. This film is a throwback to the 70's, with the classics of Blaxploitation. It will provide more laughs than a good majority of the comedies released this year. The deliberate continuity errors and goofs are hilarious."
7068,"The only problem with this is that the real world can be boring, and without the direction of Darren Aronofsky to help bolster it, Big Fan occasionally slips into this category. He is probably best known as Eddie on TV series Grounded for Life, but he has also popped up in movies like True Romance, Goodfellas, The Departed, and more recently Superbad and Pineapple Express. The acting is surprisingly good, with both Oswalt and Corrigan turning in great performances. Patton Oswalt plays Paul Aufiero, a man who loves his New York Giants. The good thing is that Paul Aufiero is neither a caricature of sports fans in general, nor does he stand - in for, for instance, Giants fans or anything like that."
7069,"The visuals are excellent and on a par with the latest computer generated movies, the story is heart warming and touches on philosophical themes often related to more adult titles like Blade Runner or even Ghost in the Shell, the action is well handled and true to the cartoon origins of the title and ultimately there is enough depth and charm in this movie to satisfy both kids and adults. Also, the movie moves along at a brisk clip, never becoming boring at any moment. Most of the funny moments came from them. Visuals are great as the sets are vibrantly composed, making every scene a joy to watch. Well, Astroboy IS well produced and IS very entertaining."
7071,"It is beautifully and strangely directed by Wes Anderson and is meaningful not just for kids, but for adults too. As a result, Fantastic Mr. Fox shines, choosing to pick traditional animation techniques to allow the viewer to relate to and communicate with the film in a way few films are able to do anymore. Fantastic Mr. Fox has the childlike wonder, the modestly dazzling sets and production design (art - Anderson is basically the way to put it by now with his films, from the title cards of species identification to maps and chapter - headings), and an original sense of perspective when it comes to action scenes and simple little camera moves that comes off extraordinary in this setting. By using a more traditional method, Fantastic Mr. Fox is also able to provide very specific quirks and personalities to each character, something often lost in newer animation. The film is lovely and insane, smart and silly, lovable and (for a few moments) a little scary, with a kick - ass soundtrack straight out of a record collection (and musical store) that connects just right right this spectacular place of someplace - England."
7072,"The cutesy versions of A Christmas Carol (The Muppet Christmas Carol and Disney's own Mickey's Christmas Carol for example) have little in common with the classic, and sometimes very scary Charles Dickens story. The truth is that this is one of the most beautiful and faithful remakes of the Dickens classic. The scenes featuring the Ghost of Christmas Present are worth the price of admission alone. It's exhilarating to see Zemeckis at a mastery of this particular shot, and in the full scope and awe in 3D it's even stronger to watch and wonder' how did they do it (?) ' He puts a modern spin on a classic tale, makes it approximately dark and mostly uncompromising for all ages - adults will jump possibly more than the kids at the WHOA effects - and Jim Carrey is nothing short of astonishing."
7073,"It concerns where babies come from before the storks deliver them: from clouds, it turns out, who shape them from their own material. This is not a complaint though because it is only a short film and as such it does do the job of being amusing by delivering these solid laughs in a short time. Throughout the short it shows clouds that create infant humans and animals of all kinds and have the storks deliver them to their new families. As with all Pixar's work, it is beautifully animated, the clouds may occasionally have a slightly cotton wool look to them, but the characters are well modelled and the colours and backgrounds are gorgeous. There is no need for a long build up, it only delivers funny moments every 10 seconds."
7074,"GREY GARDENS with Drew Barrymore and Jessica Lange is a beautiful and deeply moving tribute to a couple of women whose lives might have been forgotten if it weren't for a couple of documentary filmmakers. The direction by Michael Sucsy moves the story along at a perfect pace and Rachel Portman's music score beautifully complements the entire production. Finally, about three years ago, the material was turned into a Broadway musical that was one of the best things that year in the New York stage. First there was the magnificent documentary by David and Albert Maysles of the same title that made a great impact because it dealt with two eccentric women that had abandoned their life of privilege and society and were living in squalor at their dilapidated East Hampton home. Pieces have been filled in--but there are still empty pieces that abound--the role Little Edie's brothers had or didn't have in their lives, how the wealthy relatives so completely ignored or were unaware of their living conditions--why the Edies so completely retreated from the "" real world "" when people with much more heartbreaking situations (and much less of a moneyed background) cannot only cope but overcome --- these are all still mysteries which will probably never be answered--can only be speculated upon--and which will allow "" Grey Gardens ""--both the documentary, and now the film--to retain an enduring mystique and fascination."
7075,"You DO expect thrills and suspense and surprises in this kind of movies - you don't get them. The very moment they run out of fuel they discover that the Asian continent has moved 2500 kilometers in their direction (!) Furthermore, despite the appearance of realism thanks to some technically flawless CGI, there is no blood or gore - there should be body parts raining down from the sky during the destruction of LA, but somehow no one seems to be on the streets. The fear, analysis, curiosity, and everything else you've ever wondered about this new mysterious year that is quickly approaching is almost entirely removed from this film. The effects are good, but there are very few scenes with actual destruction and hi - tech effects."
7076,"This echoes the countless bizarre reports of children at Disneyland striking hapless costumed characters for no apparent reason and why most movies, especially war movies, deindividualize the Other in an effort not to implicate their audiences. Richard Kelly's "" The Box "", which can be divided into three sections, deals with these themes, but goes a bit further. If she will push the button, Steward will give the family a staggering 1 million dollars in cash BUT someone, somewhere in the world will die. So far so good, the first 30 minutes of this movie are good and interesting, and you will wonder what will happen if they press the button."
7077,"The movie has a lot of good tense moments with good acting but kind of start to fail with some ideas in the middle of the story, there are some flaws that make it less credible but still scary. Go get the DVD and watch the "" original "" scenes. Some movies are done just to provide entertainment."
7078,"One aspect of the film that deserves all the praise in the world is its cast, specifically the performances of its lead actresses and the surprising and unexpected quality of these performances considering the particular thespians involved. It seemed the logical climax to the movie as the mother is confronted with the evils that happened to Precious at her hands and at the hands of her boyfriend. Gabourey Sibide looks and sounds a lot like the late Hattie McDaniel; if a biopic about McDaniel is ever made, Sibide should star. Mo'Nique's performance is revelatory on multiple levels, down to the bone of the human condition and certainly up to the highest screen standards. The excellent supporting performances include a pleasing turn from singer Mariah Carey as a down - to - earth social worker with a playful personality; it's an inventive characterization."
7079,"Cage is better in this film than he has been in anything in years, maybe a decade or more, and his frazzled, unravelling, wide - eyed glee is used by Herzog in a way that renders it human and real, where it would be scenery - chewing in the hands of almost any other filmmaker. Herzog's most entertaining film to date and Cage's best performance in ages. Nicholas Cage aside, Val Kilmer doesn't probably manages to do much, but Mendes and Dourif deliver convincing performances."
7080,"The score was likable, and a couple of scenes were artistically shot, but even so it was nothing that would deserve a best cinematography or best director nomination. There were, however, a few welcome releases from the snail - like dialogue. Alice and the other Cullens throw her a surprise birthday party; while opening a gift, Bella accidentally gets a paper cut. The other well - needed break from the awkwardness came in the action scenes. Yes, the CGI was good, the Wolves were pretty great."
7081,"No morals are offered, and this is the true strength of the work as a whole. And the writing (by Camon and Moverman) acknowledges the fact that reasonably intelligent people might be watching. Oren Moverman - accomplishing this so beautifully, accurately and subtly in a small - budget film - is to be congratulated. It has a very slow pace, but it has some incredibly powerful scenes and some amazing acting. It is a rare gem in mainstream contemporary U. S. film making."
7082,"Watch out for the opening scene and the police station scene because those scenes are epic awesome. It must be noted that the extremely graphic decapitations look great though. Your suspension of disbelief will be pushed into overdrive but in the end, a movie about Ninjas doing Ninja things is always going to be at least decent. Oh and the movie gets an extra point for playing Being Boiled by Human League during the end credits. What the film does explosively well is decapitate, disembowel and explode it's victims across it's blood soaked screen."
7083,"The story is squeaky clean, and can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Other highlights include the gang trying to deliver gifts and the first house and its accident is certainly funny. This is only 26 minutes long but well worth it and a valid addition to the Madagascar movies. At just around 20 - minutes the film moves along well enough and is worth watching during the holidays. Shrek and Madagascar was some of those that survived it."
7084,"A quick note, Sheridan the director makes great use of the two daughters as comic breaks in otherwise terribly tense situations. There are a few climaxes, some extremely tense family dinners and finally a final gripping scene where Sam is pushed to the brink, he distrusts his wife, assumes his brother is sleeping with her, and no longer can see the humor in his elementary aged children, can he hold on? Both signs that the movie was enjoyable and touching. The growth of Gyllenhaal as the ex-con who is on the rise, adjusting to life on the outside and acting as a surrogate father in the absence of Macguire is nicely juxtaposed with Macguire's devolution into post-traumatic stress ridden torment. The complex relationships among the three principal players - along with Sam's Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder - are dealt with in an adult and thoughtful fashion, with a minimum of melodrama and nary a hint of sensationalism."
7087,"It's a study in how important environment is in the life of kids and teenagers, and how it can make a huge difference. It is well known that real life Michael Oher was very displeased with this film, and how it portrayed him. It was really one of the most amazing career rehabilitations since Travolta in "" Pulp Fiction "". This was a well made film, perfectly filmed, and great performances by everybody. Leigh Ann Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), seems to have the life most women would envy, a wonderful supporting husband (Tim Mcgraw), and two great kids (Lily Collins and Jae Head)."
7090,"Intricate character development, superb acting, deep and very well though through screenplay and dialogues, makes this movie a brilliant and yet simple unique creation. It is definitely one of the best movies in the past year or so."
7091,""" Warm and fuzzy "" scenes look contrived and phony, "" comical "" scenes are about as funny as having your teeth pulled out with a wrench and no anesthesia. Evidently, John Travolta, his wife, daughter and siblings needed an excuse to take a working family vacation with Robin Williams, and this cinematic open sore is the result."
7092,"Behind the apparent stillness of the film there is a torrent of emotions and Colin Firth is at the very center of it. A day of grieving for a man who lived his life within a perfectly color coordinated world, coordinated in every sense of the word until death comes unexpectedly to turn everything upside down. Yet the emphasis centers on their good times together - almost too good to be true. Colin Firth creates a character that contains a doses of his D'Arcy of Pride and Prejudice and a pinch of his Adrian LeDuc of Apartment Zero but the rest is totally inedited. Love without other implications, because love is all there is."
7093,"The bizarre but at the same time beautiful world of the in - between, the pain of the family members over the horrible loss and their unique ways of, not necessarily dealing, but rather living with it, even the sick mind behind the murder - it all works together in creating that viewing experience that is deeply touching through its countless layers. Movies based on novels are, after all, often difficult to put together in a way that is satisfying to readers yet visually engaging. There are straightforward, A to Z movies that tell their stories step - by - step from beginning to end (plot - driven), and then there are movies that weave a tale around the emotions and struggles of their characters (character - driven). A very unconventional movie that crosses many genres (murder / suspense / thriller / drama / fantasy), defies normal expectations and is an intense emotional experience. More than anything else, this film is unique."
7094,"It really is a true story of epic proportions yet it's told with an intimate feel, and it is at least 98% accurate to the events of the time. After the match millions of South African - of all races - celebrated. Nelson Mandela is the greatest and most beloved of all South Africans. When he was President he brought hope to all South Africans, white and black. South Africans would be crazy to miss this excellent film, but it deserves to be a hit all over the globe."
7095,"While CGI has produced some good hits, it isn't the same as 2 - D. It seems like "" Enchanted "" really did bring a lot of new ideas to the Disney creed, and it completely shows in the way they tackle their archetypes in this refreshing rendition. It's amazingly put together, and all the trademarks you expect to see (animal sidekicks, creepy awesome villain, amazing soundtrack, knockout visuals, strong heroine) are there in full. It marks Walt Disney Animation Studio's return to 2D animation, to recapture the era of amazing movies like The Little Mermaid, Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast â€“ timeless tales that have reached audiences across the world. Randy Newman has provided an array of songs, from bouncy piano songs to gospel to Broadway."
7096,"The truths, he finds, are more painful, than he could ever imagine. There are some very inventing and innovating twists, that are merely unpredictable. That said, this is a beautiful, heart - felt, and sometimes painful story of a father recognizing and coming to grips with the reality of his parenting and his lack of control over his children's lives. While the supporting cast turn in good performances, this is Robert DeNiro's movie. It is his best performance since Awakenings (he deserved that Oscar, and not just the nomination)."
7098,"Seeing the extra features on the DVD helped, as it's obvious that the cast and director were having a lot of fun making the film. Yes the plot follows the same formula as of all romantic comedies, but it is enjoyable and fun. A beautiful mix of country and southern - rock fits perfectly into this film with tracks such "" Mdnight Rider "" from The Allman Brothers. OK, it might not have you rolling on the floor but it definitely had enough funny moments to make it enjoyable."
7099,"When his boyfriend Nathan's holiday plans fall through, Nathan (Adamo Ruggiero) surprises Gustav by showing up on the Gunderson home to spend the holidays. Despite the fact this is a comedy and everything will probably turn out for the best, Jordan manages to make the "" what if "" fears seem real. Make the Yuletide Gay is fun and light - hearted with a few good laughs. Her wicked laugh and affection makes for plenty of interesting scenes. The script doesn't provide a big plot - like in so many other comparable coming - of - age movies - with complicated misunderstandings, plot - shifts and all kinds of side - stories; no, it just sort of strolls along on it's basic theme and in this way gets a nice and quiet development."
7100,"You have most likely met Cameron's previous work (s): Aliens, Terminator 1 & 2, The Abyss, Titanic (!) Finally there's a Robo - suit vs Navi fight and it is admittedly pretty good. It is literally "" Dances with Wolves "" in space, right down to having a "" Wind in his Hair "" character as a foil to the "" new guy "". The Na' vi inhabit a part of the moon under which lies a large deposit of valuable minerals, and the humans are trying to get them to relocate. This is the post - modern era, and originality is rare, but if there is any technical progress to be made in the world of movies and entertainment, there is one name that dwarfs all JAMES CAMERON, and after ten years hiding from the Hollywood mainstream, he is back."
7101,"Many of the film's comic scenes wouldn't be as funny without her. But when attending their son's college graduation, Jane and Jake find that everything is as simple as it once seemed. She got a taste of it in last year's "" Mamma Mia, "" but with this film, she gets to do some scenes that are openly funny. Baldwin is equally good in the comic scenes as well the dramatic scenes, and so is Martin (surprisingly. Successful Californian food store owner Meryl Streep has been happily divorced from her former husband Alex Baldwin for the last ten years, but on a trip to New York to attend their son's graduation, she starts an affair with him."
7102,He gives several summations of his observations and deductions that brought Holmes to life in an almost unparalleled way. The cinematography of the movie was special because it showed parts of the film as Holmes' future logical deductions. There were many humorous antics and displays of ingenious traps. It comes with sparkles of spontaneity and fun. This is one of the most entertaining thrillers of the year and the fantastic Downey Jr. and Law are a big part of the reason why.
7103,"Snapshot: Brilliant acting by Jeff Bridges and some solid performances by others hold up a movie that has an incoherent, low intensity albeit realistic story. The story is loosely knit by a few incidents that follow the life of a very talented country musician who is also a raging alcoholic and a chain smoker. That's the other thing: the music is actually (and this is coming from a not - big - fan of Country music save for some exceptions like Cash and Williams) quite superb. All of the songs are charged either by a real drive to bring the house down with the joy of playing live, or by the tender moments such as the "" Weary Kind "" title track, which may, along with Bridges, get T - Bone Burnett his first Oscar nod. The music is one of the things that makes Blake's journey wonderful to watch, even if, sadly, the story is lacking in ways that other movies (not just The Wrestler) do much better."
7104,"It was always enjoyable watching Alvin and Britney going at it, while the other 4 tried to keep them out of trouble. None of the characters besides the main trio are interesting, the jokes fall flat, and all the high school "" trauma "" the chipmunks deal with is about as real as an episode of Saved By the Bell."
7105,"Lets put it another way, King Eric will always be remembered and respected in this country by all supporters for his great ability and the respect he had for the game and his club. Yet the ending is so well written you are guaranteed to come out of the cinema smiling at the way just desserts are dished out. And yet Loach still manages to construct and set out these moments and these characters to tell a coherent natural story with a beginning, middle and end. The film is brutal in places and the language strong yet the excellent acting keeps it watchable and Monsieur Cantona himself seems very comfortable in front of a film camera (although sometimes his accent makes his dialog a little hard to understand). Authentic, well observed, raw in places, this film puts people first and is faithful to both Northern life, and the enigma which is Cantona."
7106,"See how all the characters turned out ten years after high school and what hilarious scenes could unfold if they all end up really drunk at their reunion? Pretty much what you'd expect from yet another straight - to - DVD attempt at capitalizing on the already thinly - stretched "" American Pie "" name. But what this movie has compared to the other American Pie movies is the fact that the writers actually try to press the sensitive button, telling horny teenagers that showing love and respect for women will get you further in life. The makers even seem fully aware they're making crap, but all they do to solve it is adding more frighteningly plastic boobs. At least there were a couple of funny lines and 3 or 4 funny scenes on that one."
7108,"This also happens to be the only movie where parents are the unknowing consumers of illicit narcotics and it is actually funny. The dialogue between the two leads is interesting and enjoyable. Nick's girlfriend Sheeni (Portia Doubleday)'s fascination with Belmondo, chanteur Serge Gainsbourg, and the existentialists,--and the general innocence of the behavior--would suggest earlier days, but in the movie, people have cell phones, and a prevalance of' shrooms and blunts makes this post-Breathless (francophile Sheeni's favorite movie). Young Canadian actor Michael Cera, the star of Miguel Arteta's adaptation of this movie, who's now twenty - one, was already a TV veteran before he was ten. This is as good a time as any for some lighthearted teenage adventures."
7109,"The special effects and action scenes are top - notch also, particularly a gruesome set - piece near the film's climax. Breaking with recent trends however, Daybreakers is by far the best of the bunch; high concept and high reward. The Spierig brothers have done an exceptional job of taking the conventional vampire film and turning it into something new and fresh. Ben Nott's sweeping cinematography and crisp editing by Matt Villa helps fulfill their vision of a dark world in which the protagonists are often difficult to identify. Plenty of action â€“ including some cool car chase scenes â€“ and at least 10 jump - out - of - your - seat moments, Daybreakers delivers on bringing a bloody good story packed with severed limbs, chopped off heads and (of course) the burning of vampire skin when exposed to sunlight."
7110,"In general the voices of dissent come from the mouths of those directly affected, and indeed it is the human face of these stories that is one of the film's engaging strengths. To put this in perspective, An Inconvenient Truth opened in 2006 on just 18 screens and a typical UK - wide release spends around Â£ 650, 000 telling people to go and see their film. The Age Of Stupid has just opened on 78 screens across the UK - a remarkable feat for a genre - defying independent feature made on a shoe string, funded by ordinary households and distributed with a launch budget of just Â£ 130, 000."
7113,"Thumbs up to the cast, especially Noomi. And it brings the trilogy to a satisfying conclusion when, for the first time, Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) utters the words "" Thank you "" to Michael Nyqvist (Mikael Blomkvist) for the favor he has done her in saving her life. Mikael and Lisbeth work separately again to clear her name and keep her from being either imprisoned or committed. Like coming to the end of an exceptional book, you'll hope for more, surely another way to eke out a Lisbeth Salander film to enjoy. The film once again stars the beautiful and stunning Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander (the title role) and Michael Nyqvist as Mikael Blomkvist."
7114,"It has to be, Audiard knows this and has created yet another great piece of cinema for his fans. A newcomer with a little bit of TV experience, his performance carries' Un ProphÃ¨te' with amazing vigor. Niels Arestrup is also outstanding as the brutal and demanding Luciani, as is Adel Bencherif as Malik's one friend from prison who serves as both a positive and a negative influence on the young man. Add to this the sophisticated editing already present in Audiard's last film' De battre mon coeur s' est arretÃ©' (2005), and you have the best European film of 2009, in spite of a story that you will most likely have seen dozens of times already. One of the biggest surprises of 2009, Jacques Audiard's' Un ProphÃ¨te' is the best French film in a decade, garnering strong critical and word - of - mouth support and winning the Grand Prix in Cannes (which for years now means that it's the actual festival winner)."
7115,"There are brief scenes of intense gore, but you can close your eyes for a second. A septic tank cleaner Sully (Hawke) wants his unborn child to have a genius IQ; a mobster boss Tarzo (D Onofrio) wants to become truly famous; and Jasper (Cassel), a deaf mute butcher, plays the horses and does dirty work for Tarzo. Great performances from all of the main cast; Ethan Hawke plays the dumb Sully Halverson with great aplomb, Vincent D'Onofrio is perfect as Parmie Tarzo and Seymour Cassel is superb as Jasper Sabiano. Minor quibble because of excellent acting from all leads, & equally good supporting cast performances. Seymour Cassel proved once again why he is a great character veteran, able to express his whole role with his face and eyes."
7116,"Supremely confident, hardened by decades of facing scoffers, deeply angry, Ruppert by nature skates on the edge between prophet and crackpot. So did Cuba, but people pulled together there, raised crops locally in every available spot of land, and soldiered through so well they're now eating better than ever."
7118,"Indeed, there are some (two, exactly) long, outrageous fighting scenes that may generate mild excitement. The absolutely funny thing is, with so few actual people watching this and voting correctly, the astro turfers have managed to keep the IMDb rating artificially high. BLOOD The Last Vampire is a fun adventure with good visuals, cool styling, and great fight scenes. Alice, for example, seems quite at home with the concept of demons after just a few minutes and has surprisingly few questions about the phenomenon."
7120,"This matches most interaction with Brad in the film, he is intense, makes no sense and his anger is often as sudden and unjustified as the moments that give him peace. Willem Dafoe and Michael PeÃ±a are bizarrely and beautifully caricatured Lynch - style detectives for whom the unusual is just another day's work. Foreboding, intriguing, smooth at times, and critically dissonant at others. After scanning the scene for the basic details, Dafoe and PeÃ±a are made aware that the main suspect, Brad McCullum (Shannon) is across the street. On a more positive note, the film looks great and has quite a lot of moments of the surreal, often humorously so."
7121,"Soul Kitchen is Akin' highly anticipated first attempt at a genuine comedy. In a recent interview he revealed he was curious to explore a more varied range of film genres which sounds like an interesting plan. Akin described how he studied classical sketches by Charlie Chaplin and also looked at his method of working. Akin makes use of a couple of his "" regulars "": Adam Bousdoukos, Moritz Bleibtreu and the great Birol Ãœnel but also introduces fresh unknown blood with the two female leads Lucia Faust and Nadine KrÃ¼ger. A nice change of pace by Faith Akin and a movie, whose flaws shouldn't hinder you enjoying it."
7123,"This guy is incredible, and if given the chance, he could be the action star the genre has lacked since the heyday of the 80's action heroes. His love story with Mika Hijii isn't anything groundbreaking, but it's moving enough. The finale is a bit over the top with the dramatics, but it does the job Final Thoughts: See it for some of the terrific action scenes. He makes some great action flicks with a very limited budget. Watch Undisputed II as well, even better than Ninja."
7128,"Much of it is a comedy, but it also has many poignant moments (keep the Kleenex nearby), some existential moments where they explore the meaning of life and work and it's also a tender film about friendship. As the journey starts off, their college life and old memories of their friendship, with a unique free - thinker Rancho who inspired them and changed their lives, are unfolded through flashbacks and followed with some twists and turns. Many of the situations / characters have resemblance or inspiration to "" Five Point Someone "", blockbuster novel penned by Chetan Bhagat. Both humour and emotional quotients are amalgamated in the right proportion, full credits to Raju for that. Film offers lots of quality rib - tickling moments throughout."
7135,""" Triangle is a very good movie about Melissa George's perfect legs, and how they. Melissa George is excellent as usual and the cast has good performances. If you're open - minded, attentive, and ready for something slightly different, chances are that you'll love this movie. Triangle is actually an effective, intelligent, layered horror / thriller (starring Melissa George's perfect legs). Her friend Greg (Michael Dorman) invites her to sail in his yacht on Saturday morning with his friends Victor (Liam Hemsworth), Downey (Henry Nixon) and wife Sally (Rachel Carpani) that unexpectedly brings her friend Heather (Emma Lung)."
7136,"After years of being a wonderful father and husband he confesses to his wife that he's gay. The love story between Jim Carrey and the astonishing Ewan McGregor is a first for the screen. Miles away from the wonderful Brokeback Mountain because here their love is public without borders. When a movie pushes your preconceptions out of the window, surprises you, enlightens you and on top of that it entertains you, you have a great movie. Much more than in "" Man On The Moon "" or "" The Truman Show "" The character allows him to be the great funny man that he is and at the same time there are layers and layers of new inedited brilliance."
7139,"From start to finish, the film is littered with classic horror references. West atmosphere is perfect, his camera work was great, the suspension was brilliant but nothing ever came from these very few moments. The suspense just keeps building, West keeps on adding more fuel onto the fire until finally he runs out and the credits starts rolling. If you particularly enjoy watching people do nothing for a hour and 10 minutes, then this is highly recommended The House of the Devil is a fastidiously detailed, pitch - perfect homage to 80's horror, that adheres to genre conventions while at the same time transcending them."
7140,"Mia is quite content to carve out her own double life, f*ck you very much! Each jaw - dropping new scene surprises yet seems the result of inexorable momentum. Fish Tank will lift you out of your seat and on an unstoppable flight, ricocheting against confines of circumstance and imploding a dysfunctional family with its head of hormonal steam. Mia's big dream is to become a big time Hip Hop dancer & is always practicing her dance moves. One of the loveliest scenes is when Connor carries a drunken Mia from the living room and puts her to bed, gently taking off her clothes while Mia, pretending to be asleep, sneaks an occasional peak and is obviously enjoying the moment."
7147,"Mikael's initial impetus to investigate one of the biggest breaking stories of sex trafficking trade in Sweden amongst those in high office is soon taking second place, when here hears of the accusations of Lisbeth being accused of murder â€“ and he then embarks on a mission to clear her name. Mikael and Lisbeth are effectively after the same goal, but they are coming at the solution from two different directions, Mikael through dogged determination and legwork, and Lisbeth a very talented computer hacker, coming from a more "" involved "" viewpoint in a savage world where rules and boundaries don't apply. The more the intriguing story unfolds, the more you find out the secrets from Lisbeth's past â€“ it's like unpeeling an onion only to find more and more hidden underneath â€“ each additional layer building her into one of the most fascinating, multi-dimensional lead female characters for many years â€“ a role brilliantly played by Noomi Rapace. Sure, Nyqvist's work is fun to watch, and the supporting players do their job well, but Rapace towers above all of them with her harried, mesmerizing portrayal of a rebellious yet strangely vulnerable woman who just won't take any crap from anyone. Secondly, the depths into Lisbeth's past were also revealed very well."
7154,"Great fights, stunts and a good story which lead to a satisfying ending. Few years later, Parkour is popular the world over and it's because of films like this and Casino Royale. Good performances, especially from the two leads, who have the right chemistry for this action comedy. Both Belle and Raffaelli are chief pratitioners in the art of Parkour, but also show that they're pretty adept at acting too. Where in B13 David Belle looked fresh and omni - competent, you can see that five years has taken its toll on his looks and his skills."
7155,"Among the standouts, Andy Bichlbaum made an appearance on BBC, posing as a executive from Dow Chemical, making the announcement that Dow is finally taking responsibility for the 1984 Union Carbide chemical lead disaster in Bhopal, India (which of course, never happened, but it did cause Dow to take a major drop in their shareholders on Wall Street), as well as their posing as members of HUD (Housing & Urban Development), appearing in New Orleans, just after Hurricane Katrina, with the promise that HUD was finally going to do something about rebuilding there. They might be crazy but the people they meet during fake presentations are sick, and they are powerful people. In other words, the Yes Men are a group of socially conscious activists who engage in pranks. Both films also fail to properly / intelligently explore that which the Yes Men rally against. The two are dedicated and funny satirists and the Yes Men is a valuable movie."
7164,"They have some really nice costumes. Drab lifeless lighting throughout the film managed to make some beautiful sets and costumes look flat and uninteresting. Surely the warmth of candlelight would give someone in the lighting department a bit of inspiration, a chance to increase the sensual feelings necessary for a lot of the laughable debauchery scenes? Watching a person drink, smoke, do drugs and engage in orgies with highly unattractive women while everyone around him wonders why he still looks the same isn't horrific, yet that seems to be the entire crux of what passes as horror in the film. The relationship between Dorian and Sybil, for example, from initial meeting to marriage proposal, to break - up and suicide is covered in the space of TWELVE MINUTES."
7166,"It's surprising how well the film comes off with the elements, and they are ALL familiar: the cop just nearing retirement (Gere), on his way out, who has to shepherd a rookie through his first days on the; a corrupted cop (redundant mayhap) that is scrounging for any money he can on raids (Hawke) needs it for a slightly noble cause, a new house for his growing family; a cop undercover (Cheadle) has to choose promotion or loyalty with a criminal takedown on the horizon. But where Fuqua sets himself apart, as he did to a good if not great extent on Training Day, is to imbue importance (not pretentious but just enough for serious effect) in the direction of scenes, and in casting. With his role as the on - his - way - out cop, he gives one of his best performances, worn and weary, but strong and good as a cop whenever he can see fit, who at one point makes a mistake that he won't cop to (watch Gere when he's interrogated about his rookie's mishap on a convenience store scuffle and it's something of genius work). All the performances were excellent; in particular Richard Gere as the world - weary Eddie, Don Cheadle as the street-wise Tango and Ethan Hawke as the up - tight Sal. The performances are great and there are some really superb visual moments too."
7168,"Clinging to his old moral values, disciplined and always wearing a tie, he is an example of the post war generation who are becoming fewer and fewer on the estate. "" Harry Brown "" is not a pleasant film to watch, but it is certainly an experience which will pull on every one of your your emotions and is impossible to ignore. Harry, who is now very emotionally upset and frustrated by the polices lack of help decides that justice must be served and he takes matters into his own hands. The night scenes are beautifully lit as well with a good balance between just enough to see what's going on and making the lighting realistic: the night scene in the pub with the lights out, for instance. This isn't an easy' first - date' film but it is a superior Brit film, one of the best for many years."
7171,"To take 8 years of American history on his shoulders in such a funny, awkward, shocking, detailed, eyes - opened, over-the-top, superb, state - of - the - art way is just a great pleasure to watch and a relief that the real life of Mr. Bush as a president is finally over. It's crazy and smart satire with more hits than misses. Now keep in mind, you don't have to have been very involved and alert regarding George W. Bush's eight years as president of the United States, you can still laugh your a ** off at the material presented to you by Will Ferrell's great comedic mind, because the show is not all references of his two terms in the White House. If you take it as an attempt at political satire then it is a total fail because there is almost nothing clever in here; considering the Daily Show ate well for years off the Bush presidency and produced constant material that was as funny as it was cutting. There are some truly hilarious moments - the Condi Rice scene was great, as well as some of the Dick Cheney reflections - and even a more or less serious moment, when Ferrell's Bush reflects on those who've died as a result of the war in Iraq."
7174,"Some famous names in the bunch, and everyone delivered good performances. All in all, a nice film with a bunch of dark twists to it. Finally, in a tragically but necessarily brief role, Richard Dreyfuss is hilarious as a respectable Tulsa philanthropist with several shady ties to the less respectable underbelly of the community, making his few scenes shine with shrewd hilarity. With the same charming, powerful yet slightly kooky tone which pervades many of his acting performances, Nelson sets up his film in a wonderfully askew fashion, taking delight in veering right when the logical narrative progression would suggest left, and offering a fair share of surprise twists, including several jarring or downright uncomfortable bursts of serious intensity discordantly changing altering the generally breezy mood. It is fascinating to see certain movies that achieve a specific balance between the familiar and the unique, a particular dynamic perfectly representative of writer / director / actor Tim Blake Nelson's Leaves of Grass."
7175,"There is a lot of comic relief in it: Holly, the "" dumb "" sexy girl provokes a few good laughs, e. g. when she asks whether she's an immortal whore, while meaning immoral. Overall, this is a movie that not only sports a few sexy looking women but also is quite entertaining bringing up a few real - life situations (mother - child relationships, adultery, responsibility, trust, truth and porn). There's a cute little satirical interview with the "" porn stars "", conducted by Joseph Gordon - Levitt."
7179,"Some elements are surprisingly good, while others are just clichÃ©'d and melodramatic. The acting is adequate amongst all the principal characters, the direction choppy in places, the look of the film is beautiful. And both Renee Zellwegger as the passionate and trapped social worker and Jodelle Ferland as the adorable but mysterious child are quite amazing. There are some scenes, like the woman in the hospital room that turns into a kind of large oven, that are chilling and really well done. This being said, the common devices director Alvart chooses for the film still work, and Ferland (Lilith) does a good job in a demanding role for a girl who was twelve or thirteen years old when the movie was completed, on 2007."
7180,"Aside from the usual gorgeous cinematography featuring schools of dolphins in motion, and plenty of synchronized swimming, with creatures big and small ranging from the giant whales to the newly hatched turtles struggling to make it to the waters before being picked up mercilessly by their predators, this is one documentary that allows you to go up close to these creatures since cameras were planted into the depths of all the oceans of the world. Nature documentaries are no longer made for the small screen, but have some mighty budget to be able to bring quality to the making of such films, serving to entertain and to capture beauty so rarely seen. Disney bought the film, cut 20 minutes (much of it critical of human activity endangering the oceans and animal habitats), junked Perrin's spare narration, which lets you wonder at the sights on view, and substituted a gabby but emotionally chilly commentary by Pierce Brosnan. Even the occasional facts stated remain unexplained - e. g., you learn that most species of large whales travel distances of several thousand kilometers twice a year, but you get no idea why, let alone why some feed near the poles and others in warm waters, just to provide one typical example. Undescribable movie about wonderful creatures living in the oceans and the surroundings."
7181,"As directed by Kevin Heffernan (who also appears, alongside his fellow Broken Lizard writers and actors, as one of the waiters), "" The Slammin' Salmon "" is not the most sophisticated or highbrow comedy you'll ever see, but its breezy style and high - energy performances go a long way towards making something uniquely unhinged and genuinely fun out of the material. In The Slammin' Salmon the waitstaff of a high end seafood restaurant compete against each other to win $10, 000 for selling the most food in one night. And, as others have indicated, Michael Clark Duncan's performance is classic--just awesome. While people are going to INSTANTLY compare this to Super Troopers on how it doesn't reach that standard (easily the funniest and most quotable movie of their repertoire) and while it is slow in the beginning, the movie easily has you laughing with the absurdness. So yes, it is an improvement on Beerfest; the Slammin' Salmon is just straight up funnier."
7183,"In many ways this is the natural, and equal, follow - up to Memories of Murder. There is a scene (without spoiling anything here) where Kim Hye - ja asks the other' retarded' kid if he has a mother and it's one of the most complex and heart - rending scenes in cinematic history. This is suspenseful film - making, from the overall arc of finding out the details of the crime, to little moments that are just suffocating. Bong throws light on that extraordinary capacity of some women to totally subjugate their own lives to those of their children, who live for the pep that they get seeing often unappreciative family members troughing their way through their latest offering."
7185,"Farhadi's cast is uniformly excellent, especially Farahani, who compellingly registers Sepideh's shock at how her seemingly innocent matchmaking has taken such a tragic turn, as well as the way her character, like others in the film, is revealed to not be what it initially appears. The most remarkable thing about this Berlin Silver Bear directing (Asghar Farhadi) winner is that despite all the suspense and tension, what it is about is so ordinary daily life that it could easily happen to anybody, anywhere. The acting is excellent although the cast is unknown, with the exception of Golshifteh Farahani who acted opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in "" Body of lies "" (2008) as the charming nurse his characters falls in love with. The brilliance of Farhadi's script and direction becomes most apparent in the latter stages of the film. All the actors here are superb but special mention must go to Golshifteh Farahani, Shahab Hosseini and Saber Abar."
7186,"When you think of revenge movies you generally picture a guy with a gun taking a swift and direct action against everyone who has ever wronged him. This adds an underlying tension to the fairly subtle story as Bazil, out of work with nowhere to live, finds comfort with a group of fascinating sideshow style vagabonds who eventually become his allies in his battle against the greed, murder and manipulation of powerful arms dealers. Aside from a truly riveting series of sly, witty and purposeful acts by this band of revengers, the film is also striking in its beauty with every scene presenting an intense array of colours fusing with incredibly intricate and detailed backdrops. These prevail particularly with the' sideshow' who recycle scrap in to wonderful creations fresh from a fifties cartoon short. This depicts the correlation between the real world here and an animated fantasy - land with the epic and extremely clever revenge plan played out in much the same way that Sylvester chases Tweetie Pie or Wyle E. Coyote stalks Road Runner."
7188,"Finally a "" superhero "" movie you can relate to, instead of everything being all high and mighty on morals and super powers. What made this movie unique was the blend of genres which works really well. Hats off to Woody Harrelson for his marvelous performance as Arthur / Defendor. The story told in "" Defendor "" easily picks you up and keeps you tight. Such astute genre awareness combined with the wonderfully imaginative collection of Defendor's makeshift crimefighting weapons (including the most inspired use of marbles seen in ages) could easily have assured for an hour and a half of lighthearted, enjoyable cinematic fun."
7190,"Also some of the filming is superb, and is recognizable also for director Oliver Hirschbiegel and his work on Der Untergang (Downfall) describing the last days of Hitler. This is an excellent (fictional) drama centered around just one of many single acts of mindless violence, and its aftermath during the notorious "" troubles "" of Northern Ireland. In Giffen's perception, Little is living it large, spouting platitudes for fat pay cheques while enjoying classy hotels and associated' luxuries' - in short Giffen believes Little enjoys a' rock star' lifestyle on the back of a callous murder. In this grand location, the balcony is the only place anyone can smoke, both Joe Giffen and Vika take this opportunity and her empathetic / sympathetic words begin to eat into Giffen. This film is a fiction inspired by two men who bear the legacy of one of those killings."
7195,""" Valhalla Rising "" is a strange movie that will split the audience into lovers and haters like you can see in the comments here. If a movie goer sees a movie like this with breathtakingly beautiful and artistic cinematography on a low budget and still rates it with one or two stars, its either pure ignorance or something was struck that resonated in a negative way. The imagery is stunning throughout, the most simple shots like a close up of knifes being washed in a river look like a beautiful painting and the constant difference between the beauty of the cinematography and the cold colors, raw violence and the dark droning soundtrack are as captivating as Mads MIkkelsen playing the cold expressionless "" One Eye "" like a force of nature. That being said, if judged in terms of cinematic and visual experience, it was beautifully shot, and the much vaunted fights scenes (especially the ones in the beginning) were awesome in their brutality. The director sets great scenes in some awesome locations, so your eyes will be in for a treat."
7198,"It is a hypnotic trip that displays brilliant originality and borderlines pure insanity. What if you could be the master of your own universe, able to make everything to your own specifications and liking? A stunning allegory about the evils of totalitarianism, "" Dogtooth "" is somewhat reminiscent of M. Night Shyamalan's "" The Village "" in its basic premise and setup, only here the guiding principle seems to be less about protecting the young ones from the harsh realities of a modern world and more about this one man's finding a way to achieve a kind of apotheosis for himself - making himself a god in the eyes of his children."
7199,"While Detective Jobson seems to be having a change of heart and starts digging in to the case wanting to do the correct thing, which some of his fellow officers begin questioning. The sprawling plot brings together all the pieces (child abuse, serial murders and police corruption) to put them as one; as every little detail, lead and revelation about this deeply crafted and intelligent crime story comes to a conclusion. Tucker is a master at his characters' catharses and at carefully observing and commenting on the infinitely heartbreaking human characteristics of revenge, redemption and atonement. Tucker concludes Jarrold and Marsh's films in this way: he extracts Jarrold's poignancy from "" 1974 "" and Marsh's intelligence from "" 1980 "", mixes them and adds his own masterful touch while tying the loose ends of each film's plots."
7203,"Unlike great horror movies, this film literally has nothing to say about modern culture, gender roles, human fears or scientific hubris. : D If you see it, make sure you have the option of fast forwarding through 90% of the movie and just getting to the perverted fecal - eating scenes that the movie's creators probably got a good, decent sized erection by creating!"
7227,"The actress that played Dren was also strong and had the perfect mix of human, alien, and innocence. If there is anything wrong with the film, it is the final act. The various creatures that appear during the film, specifically the differing evolutions of the spliced together science project nicknamed Dren, are the true marvel of the film. While some look a whole lot better than others (the early renditions of Dren suffer the most), all of these nightmarish beings look excellent and for all intents and purposes, a lot better than they ever should have looked. Great care and detail went into creating these effects, and even more went into some of the makeup used on Delphine ChanÃ©ac and Abigail Chu to make the look of Dren become increasingly more believable."
7230,"The statement of there only being one question which can only be seen through two layers of glass with only two people wearing glasses in the room. "" Exam "" is a wonderful psychological study of eight people who are the top candidates for an important job with a high - level corporation. Tensions rise as the clock steadily descends towards zero, and each candidate must decide how far they are willing to go to secure the ultimate job. The candidates find the sheet in from of each of them blank. One of the candidates has the disease."
7238,"There isn't much more to the action than that, but it's all in the details as Ade spins out one scene after another in which Eidinger and Minichmayr run through a range of emotions together. The parameters within which any relationship must be set are still evolving and fluid in the case of Chris and Gitti, and this leads to much pushing of the boundaries and behavioral experimentation on the part of the couple throughout the course of the film. But when the calibration is subtle, as with Jane Austen, little matters like buying a dress or deciding what to carry on a hike become matters from which much is to be learned. chris is given a far greater inner life than gitti, and if she is a borderline psych case then so are many other girls who simply want some attention from a slightly hidebound, professionally insecure intellectual whose lone thoughts tend to his self rather than theirs. Birgit Minichmayr and Lars Eidinger's unrestrained and authentic interpretations of the quarrelsome lovebirds who becomes clouded by the shadow of doubt upon meeting a steadier and more established couple, makes this hot and picturesque contemporary romance an atypical and thoughtful movie experience."
7239,"It was challenging notions of true love in a way that was actually challenging - if you met someone and fell in love, would you give up true love for them? She and her sister's love interest both have timers that sync and they are roughly the same age. Sure, science - fiction concepts and love stories aren't exactly bread and butter, but "" TiMER "" opens up infinite possibilities for discussion about what true love really is while remaining lively, entertaining and sharply written. Although her story is the main thread, there are numerous subplots that explore the various possibilities of the implications of such a device. With an interesting premise - that people can get timers telling them when they will meet their soul mate - the story follows Oona and her sister Steph, who are both nearing their thirties and have yet to find their other halves."
7260,"Anyone interested in an engaging, thrilling and gripping emotional roller - coaster should enjoy Cherrybomb. Cherrybomb is a great film for anyone who likes, drama, comedy, a bit of romance, and a burst of reality. The storyline goes like this: Two 16 - year - olds, best friends, fall for the new girl in town. Grint brings a touching sincerity and warmth to the role of Malachy, a boy who falls in love with a girl for the first time, and is willing to risk everything just to be with her. Instead of flashy special effects, they opt for an imaginative use of real - life sets, unusual camera angles, lots of close - up shots, expressive colours and clever editing."
7264,"The climax of the film is the Winnebago Man speaking at some "" hip "" SF show, which shows viral videos. This documentary is worth watching due to the vigor and articulate nature of the subject, Jack Rebney. Mr. Rebney clearly is lonely, despite his solitary endeavors, and wants to share his mind with others. While Jack's opinions may or may not fit in with whatever narrative Steinbauer's trying to construct, to filter them out of the film is disgraceful and disrespectful to Mr. Rebney. It's amazing what an interesting person Jack Rebney is and how much he represents."
7265,"Mr Nobody, Nemo Nobody, is now 100 years old, the last mortal on earth in 2092, and he is about to die. Exceptionally imaginative, acutely funny and startling, this production reeks of intelligence and craftsmanship, breaks down linear storytelling into bits, only to shuffle the whole thing in a brilliantly orchestrated masterpiece. In practice, it means that this is a very non-linear experience in terms of time and space, real and imaginary, showing you results of important choices either way. There's also lots of food for thought and should provoke very interesting discussions afterwards especially on what might have happened if choices in your life had been different. Each fragment represents a choice, each choice represents a series of circumstances and each circumstance represent the possibilities which this person is subject to, in his life."
7270,"It is a sensitive but sexy movie about a woman in her forties and her post-divorce encounters with different feelings like hatred, low self - esteem, domestic problems and her personal life. Not only does it star two great actors, Catharine Zeta Zones and Justin Barber but there are also two amazing young kids that add to the humour and inspiration behind the story. Zeta - Jones and Bartha, who seem an odd couple at first evaluation, give nice performances as the afflicted twosome while all other cast members do a nice job, too. It makes you smile in places with some witty and amusing scenes and also imparts some wisdom about life and any relationship. Not just because she is beautiful but the emotions portrayed by her are extremely believable and life like."
7273,"After - show delights from fans (including a girl trying to climb a cottage and failing) and artists (who are fans, of course), people arriving to the resort, history, gigs, snippets of Patti Smith, Sun Ra, Iggy Pop and others from different eras explaining how they feel about music are included, as well as the place in itself. But because the whole thing is made up of fan footage, as well as some camera - work by the bands themselves, it's very disjointed and jarring in places but, for the most part, it's plain impressive."
7277,"Intelligent, moving, sometimes shocking and occasionally funny this is an engrossing and enjoyable piece of work that gives food for thought as well as an entertaining ghost train of a ride. Jamie should rebirth as a Phoenix without his birthmark, provided he meets the Weapons Man (Eddie Marsan) and vandalizes and brings chaos to Papa B. Jamie becomes self - confident and when he meets Tia by chance, he dates her. However, the Weapons Man visits him and tells that he must collect a heart and leave it on the stairway of a church. The performances are top - notch and the conclusion explains the bad trip of Jamie; who are the demons; who is Belle indeed; and why he has met and dated Tia. Now, without the physical disfigurement Jamie attracts a pretty delivery girl Tia (ClÃ©mence PoÃ©sy) and seems to have found his wishes come true - with Tia and Charlie as family."
7279,"An upper middle class (or, let's face it, upper class) family of four - the Joneses, Steve, Kate, Jenn and Mick - move in to a very nice new house. It's a wicked little game made up so that all of the relationships of the Jonses with the outside world are of a shallow, synthetic nature by design. Kate (Moore) is the leader of the unit, making sure everyone is up to par on their sale percentages, especially Steve (Duchovney) a failed golf pro turned car salesman who is on shaky ground. Demi Moore hasn't been this appealing (perhaps ironically so considering her cold business - like character) in years; Duchovney does well as a genuinely good person who happens to be working like a con - man; Amber Heard is the newest hot girl on the block seemingly genetically engineered between Kiera Knightley and Kristen Stewart's good looks. The chemistry between Duchovny and Demi was explosive, and Amber Heard was even hotter."
7304,"With an interesting enough story about the beginnings of internet commerce, the film probably gets enough facts right to be able to say, "" based on a true story "". However, if you can get past that, you might find the movie fairly entertaining and at times hilarious, thanks to some quite original plot twists and turns. They practically create the cash and demolish everything skillfully. Giovanni Ribisi overacts, but here it works. While this movie had its really funny moments its also dramatic throughout."
7344,"It is truly one of a kind, one of the treasures of the art world. The modern museum gives art much more space to breathe, and scholars and curators can and do illuminate art by arranging it, and juxtaposing it, in new and different ways. Blockbuster exhibitions are not merely money - makers for museums, but are opportunities to see art in a different context, and for scholars and curators to advance the study of art by combining pieces in new and different ways. Allowing the work to travel, and to be arranged differently, and to even move into a new building, is reasonable (over centuries, a dozen different curators and scholars might bring their era's thinking and aesthetic to the collection). Each generation produces new scholarship, and artworks of genuine cultural importance should be available to the finest scholars and curators of each generation."
7349,"Awesome performances by actors who had characters written as real people, not effen cardboard cutouts like most slasher films. He manages a momentary escape, before being chased up a tree by Lola's father in his Kingswood and having rocks thrown at him by Lola, which causes Brent to fall onto the car below, knocking him out so they can tie him up once again. While it provides a bit of relief from all the torture scenes, and Mia's revealed to be connected to a previous victim of Lola's, it doesn't really amount to very much. The movie is from and based in Victoria, Australia and when it comes to bat s ** t crazy movies the Aussies really go all out. Lola (Robin McLeavy) is a seemingly shy and meek girl who gathers her courage to ask her crush Brent (Xavier Samuel) to the prom."
7352,"However, stylistically, Bunny and the Bull can compete with the classics in eccentricity; stealing nuggets of genius from directors such as Gondry, Gilliam and Burton. With the plot holding the potential to get an audience gripped and engaged, the acting seemed rigid and confused in places. However, the film takes the much loved quirks from first series of Boosh and manages to restrain them; connecting its celebrated vivid imagery with the real world, which allows viewers to connect better with the narrative. All elements, be it emotions, performances, sets, character development, or animation, are well - controlled and contained as a proper English would have it; yet it's radical, outrageous, bold, and sometimes uncomfortably daring. Reminiscent of Michel Gondry's work, Paul King has created a fantasy world that is both beautiful and unique."
7371,"Most compelling is the sense that Ellsberg gives of a man motivated by an extraordinarily strong inner moral compass; while the likes of Nixon would do anything to hold onto what they had, Ellsberg risked a life in prison in the hope of ending the war. Terrific movie, the qualities embodied by Ellsberg should be encouraged in anyone seeking public office. Judith Ehrlich & Rick Goldsmith co direct this well documented film, with testimony from those who were there, both currently still living, as well as those who have passed away over the years, from a script written by Judith Ehrlich & Michael Chandler. Featuring: Daniel Ellsberg, John Dean, Patrica Ellsberg, Bud Krogh, Tony Russo & Hendrick Smith, as well as the voices of Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger, and others involved in the dirty dealings of war. Four years in the making, this got Ellsberg's participation as narrator and having the final word after publishing his best seller "" Secrets "" and subsequent book tour of "" Secrets ""."
7395,"The artiloect war, according to De Garis, will take place right before machines achieve consciousness. A lot of folks are reluctant to watch this documentary because they feel like Kurzweil is "" just wrong . "" com) Regardless of what you think of Ray Kurzweil, his predictions, or the singularity, they certainly make interesting subjects for a documentary. The subject of this documentary, Ray Kurzweil, is an accomplished inventor and futurist whose creations include a reading machine for the blind. The film focuses on Kurzweil's ideas about "" The Singularity "" an event in which humans will be able to incorporate machines into their bodies, including their brains, and augment their intelligence."
7397,"The visuals are breathtaking at moments. The film does give you breathing space with lighthearted interactions between characters and humor and thus makes it less heavy overall than NGE and EOE even though it certainly is more gruesome and still has it's moments of pure nightmare fuel. 0 is a much bigger departure from the original series than the first movie was, and it's an incredible anime feature, as a result. The interactions of the characters are becoming more believable, and individual personalities are being better exposed and explained. It varies from beautifully orchestrated racing score to sweet and engaging J - pop and Anno sure makes the out - of - place songs fit as well as he did in the show and EOE."
7398,"The film pays special attention to Jack and Meg's famous free side - shows that occurred in a wide variety of fantastic settings, from a city bus in Winnipeg to the Arva Flour Mill outside London. Audiences are treated to intimate back - stage interviews with the band, comedic interactions between Jack, Meg, and their fans, and never - before - seen coverage of some of the most action - packed, breathlessly amazing concerts ever to come to Canada. It was simply an amazing experience, the moments captured in this documentary are priceless along with the the many unusual and interesting setting and venues that they played! Powerful live versions of the songs, great moments with Jack and Meg that make you love them both even more! The camera work, the editing, the use of black and white and other filters, all made this an absolute joy to watch."
7411,"This series is triumphantly successful at doing just that, partly owing to the care that has been taken with the script and partly due to the outstanding performances of the leads. If it did, perhaps, labour the point a bit at the beginning, there were superb contrasts between where Emma's life was full and empty. It's beautifully shot, all the characterisations are incredibly detailed, even minor characters like John Knightley and Mrs Goddard are fully realised and Garai and Miller hit their top notes reliably again and again. Romola Garai does play Emma very well. Romola Garai is a youthful, vivacious and expressive Emma Woodhouse."
7416,"NYPD has (had) a history of making the crime' fit' the criminal, and, as the two defense attorneys of Rand point out, a lot of the evidence (in the Holly Ann Hughes trial) was circumstantial. Zeman and Brancaccio do a sterling job of piecing together all available evidence and reports involving Rand, including interviews with family and friends of the missing children and the detectives who worked on the case. Considering their budget, and resources, the film - makers made a valiant documentary, using archival news reports, and interviews - both past and present - with NYPD detectives, family members and others connected with Staten Island / Cropsey, examined and retraced these events."
7422,"The story begins with a math genius high school boy Kenji and his secret idol Natsuki going back to her hometown Nagano to celebrate her great grandmother's 90th birthday. One night, Kenji unintentionally helped crack the security code of a second life net community called "" OZ "" where billions of users communicate and live. Here the voice acting by the experienced actors or actresses enlivened all the characters, especially the great grandmother's affectionate yet dignified voice was just awesome. In 2006, Mamoru Hosoda proved himself a promising animation director in "" The Girl Who Leapt Through Time "". As Kenji, a high school student, takes on a job for the most popular girl in school, Natsuki, stuff is quickly spiralling out of control for him."
7434,"In a genre that is quickly becoming based only on graphic, grotesque, shocking blood and gore sequences and predictable horror and grisly effects, this thriller is actually attractive for all the right reasons and should be enjoyed highly by those that appreciate true horror / thriller films as opposed to the blood soaked hacker / slasher movies that are being pumped out monthly. Creepy and frightening film with fantastic events, thrills, chills, suspense and nail - biting scenes. It's certainly worth a rental if you like slower paced psychological horrors rather than the type of movie where everyone runs around attempting to avoid crazed killers. Considering the amount of inferior horror films that hit theatres in mass each month and contain equal parts bad acting and routine slasher kills, The New Daughter is above the meridian. The actors playing the children are fine, even if they don't exhibit a lot of emotive moments and simply go from A to B as required."
7448,"The film consists of interviews with Hicks' family, associates and childhood pals, but the dialogue is sculpted such that the film plays less like a documentary and more like a moving 3 act tragedy. Directed by Matt Harlock and Paul Thomas, "" American: The Bill Hicks Story "" is an excellent documentary which has the hard task of making Bill's childhood years interesting, and chartering his long, lonely years on the road. One of life's many contradictions is that the country that spawned a genius also spurned him, most notably David Letterman scrapping his final (of many) appearances on the late show. Over the years, numerous other comedians would borrow from and be influenced by Hicks. The plot is fairly simple - it starts off with his early years & ends with his death from cancer."
6783,"Newcomer Kodi Smit - McPhee is just as good, and together they carry the entire film on their shoulders, and they do it effortlessly. This is probably due to the medium but Viggio Mortenson did a fabulous job as the Protagonist (the unnamed father) and his son was also great. The acting of the two leads is superb. All you need to know going in (if you're part of not - read - book camp) is that a father and son, after becoming on their own after the mother of the house exits, are traveling together across a true post-apocalypse landscape to a coast. And, more importantly, the acting and chemistry between the two leads is incredible."
7276,"Perhaps your biggest mistake in assuming history of this movie is your statement: "" Then comes the fight scenes and complete absence of interesting Roman tactics, when attacked and flanked on a long narrow path they simply form a 1 man thick shield wall and wait . "" Her backstory is a powerful device that explains all the hatred she has for Romans and the length she will go to exact revenge. Where Marshall is more effective is in the portrayal of the Picts. Although the structure of the film firmly puts the Picts in the "" baddies "" slot, there are several hints and a lot of subtext that, on the contrary, showcases the Roman empire as bloodthirsty invaders, plotting backstabbers and savages themselves. The picture deals with historical facts about confrontation between Romans and Picts."
7491,"It's not "" The Godfather "" or "" Shawshank Redemption "", but it's a good old fashioned action movie that keeps your attention. It follows a group of criminals who are good at what they do. Their rule for jobs is to wait at least a year to lay low. All the movie ends up doing is trying to be Heat but with a more "" hip "" and "" modern "" crew of criminals. Takers has all of these scenes as well just mixed around a bit, and they literally do the armored car heist scene from The Italian Job."
7278,"And women's breasts and butts are constantly being shown on screen. And Richard Dreyfuss does an amusing bit at the beginning (Remember "" Jaws ""?) The concept seemed like a lock: the titular creatures with the razor - sharp teeth and unquenchable thirst for blood go ballistic on a couple dozen hardbodies during spring break; and to sweeten the deal (for those who prefer gore and boobies in their lap), the project would utilize 3D, the current industry standard for inflated ticket prices and deflated expectations. Some movies come close, others fail miserably, and others deliver a different experience entirely. Piranha 3D is the rare film the delivers exactly what the trailers, synopses and every ounce of marketing promises â€“ buckets of blood, campy humour and boobs â€“ lots and lots of boobs."
7631,"The movie' The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya' was excellent. The screenplay itself has a lot of depth and successfully portrays the uniqueness that is The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. For example, the scenery and atmosphere is a little different from the anime, but it is for the better. This movie is approximately 2 hours and 40 minutes long. Given the fact that the Christmas celebration isn't the focus of the finale and hardly plays into the story other than some minor motivation for Kyon, it's strange that the movie focuses so much on the minutiae of it all."
7280,"The movie was fast - paced, overall enjoyable to watch, the main character is motivated to fight, while sadly this is found lacking with the other tekken fighters. With fast - paced action, brief dialogues and some dazzling fight sequences, one can easily get taken away by the Tekken action, even if they are ludicrous and downright incredulous. It helps that it makes at least an effort to keep some of the story and characters from the games, while offering frequent decent, if not great, fight scenes. The movie had brilliant fight scenes, however, being a huge fan of the original story line, it was quite a disappointment for fans all over the world due to the huge amount of changes from the original story line. The writers of this movie did the best they could to pick out the story of Tekken."
7282,"The assassin is determined to do one last job before giving up his nefarious profession, but two women are complicating his intentions: fellow shootist Mathilde, played icily by the Dutch Thekla Reuten, and a local prostitute Clara, the beautiful Italian actress Violante Placido. The American (2010) Like many George Clooney movies, this one is cinematically superb. What this means is he is more than an actor, he's an influence behind the scenes. And he's good for the movies (the industry), even if sometimes he pushes his movies into a slickness that is dulling. There are aspects that make it one of those films that will view really well fifty years from now."
7283,"All the cast performed to expectations and that was very good. jen aniston was perfect as was bateman. It's a vehicle for two popular stars playing characters in their 30s who are, despite good looks and basic social skills, single and childless. His interactions with the boy of six or so are terrific. But it is Aniston and Bateman together that really make the movie glide along and make you smile."
7284,"How it is possible to change the current mindset of greed, privatisation and consumerism into one more caring towards humans, wild animals and the Planet is a challenge but it must happen soon. Those in control of these Global Corporations are so morally corrupted by greed that some Governmental regulation is needed to control these rabid pillagers of the Planet. Fox's intimate approach and genuine stake in the issue is "" GasLand's "" greatest asset. Debunking sites, debunking threads and 1 star reviews on IMDb have begun before a wider audience can get a chance to see this film. People with education & common sense (which seems to have been killed off by greedy politicians or bankers whatever you choose to call them) need to stand together & act."
7286,"If anything, it's a clever film with a lot of great action sequences, intriguing characters, many interesting subplots, and a good story at its base. Two great movies from two fantastic directors with some hilarious fake trailers thrown in there for the price of one. If you like silly action movies with fantastic actors and a surprisingly good plot, then look no further than Machete. There is an interesting mix of the usual Rodriguez players (Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin, Jeff Fahey), really good actors (Robert De Niro), notoriously bad actors (Steven Seagal, Don Johnson), and talented players that have made some bad film choices over the last few years (Jessica Alba, Lindsay Lohan). It's why Machete is such a great film for the times, and will be looked upon as one of the culturally relevant films of the last couple years"
7287,"But what made it a good movie was the fact that, for all the genuine laughs, it quite simply rang true. You grow weary of hearing the profanity - if it were in the service of genuine comedy and laughs it would be one thing, but there's at most two laughs to be had in this entire misbegotten film. While this is not a movie for small children, the tenderness with which the central relationship is played and the integrity and genuine caring portrayed by each half of the central couple wouldn't be a bad lesson for teens to learn. But Garrett's eccentric roommate Dan (Charlie Day) and Erin's sister's personality quirks add real spice to most scenes, and the very real chemistry between the main characters (Barrymore and Long have had a real life on - off - on relationship) transcends the simplicity and makes Going the Distance something more. Long, perhaps best known as the "" Mac guy "" on those infamous Mac / PC commercials, proves an able partner."
7289,"If you must, just rent it on DVD that will inevitably come out a month after the film is released. With pop references that were almost extinct by the time this movie saw the light of day, you wonder who was supposed to laugh at those scenes. VAMPIRES SUCK will surprise many people because it's an improvement over the previous spoof films directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have been churning out for the past couple of years. EPIC MOVIE switches scenes every 5 minutes however this is acted like a real movie, with one story line which makes sense and follows up the whole way through, even taking some lines from the original twilight movie. In fact, all "" Vampires Suck "" really had to do was recreate the first two Twilight films pretty much scene - for - scene, tweaking here and there to make the scenes only slightly more ridiculous than the originals."
7290,"Oh, and probably the most important question of all, who in the right mind hires composers under the name' TomandAndy' to compose a movie like this? Make up: Character been through the' wars' covered in mud and guts, blink and perfect makeup is reapplied and hair in perfect condition."
7291,"Even if it were just a "" movie about Facebook "", why is such subject matter off - limits? Good, very good and Andrew Garfield, the most recognizable of the characters is a victim of sorts and he'll be destroyed no matter how much money he gets. In the real world, what is interesting is not what happened with a girlfriend or some jock twins. Adapted from Ben Mezrich's book "" The Accidental Millionaires "", the framework for the fascinating narrative is not one but two courtroom dramas or, to be more accurate, pre-trial hearings (both resulted in out - of - court settlements which tells you a lot). The outstanding acting, style and direction, as well as the great script armed to the teeth with sharp dialogue is what people are likely to miss by dismissing it as a mere' Facebook movie'."
7292,"There's no doubt that if "" The Town "" becomes a success that studios will seek out Affleck for some more high - profile projects and it will certainly be interesting to see how he handles material not rooted in Boston sub-culture. As long as he continues to get such memorable performances out of his actors, he'll be doing things on the other end of the camera for a long time to come. The action scenes are handed pretty well and the car chases through the minor roads of Boston are really exciting to watch. The entire cast are all fantastic even when given smaller roles, for example Chris Cooper and the late Pete Postlethwaite steel the scenes that they are in. As a crime film, it is important that the action doesn't turn the whole film into an all guns blazing film."
7293,""" Easy A "" is a welcomed throwback to earlier teen comedies: risquÃ©, but heartfelt. In Emma Stone you have a Molly Ringwald for a new generation: relate - able, sexy, funny, sarcastic and lovely shines as Olive, a girl who leads her best friend (Aly Michalka) to believe she wasn't a virgin. There are many pluses with this film: A cast of young actors who are true actors who can convey the humor and uphold the tone of the film; a truly funny, vibrant script by Bert V. Royal in which not only the teens get to be smart and fully fleshed out characters but the adults (Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci as Olive's wry and whimsical parents are a joy; and Thomas Haden Church whose character is a new spin on the "" hip teacher "".) What makes this film special--aside from a script to die for and a superb portrayal by Stone, showing no strain whatsoever under the burden of dual duty, that is, both acting and doing a first person narrative, like Bogey in a filme noire--is the simple fact that Stone will not be reprising this role (or anything similar) in either her lifetime or yours. Writer Bert V. Royal's script delivers an intellectual and comedic look into high school life."
7294,The Naples presented here seems out of the mind of someone who's never been to Naples. Also Javier Bardem is worth the price of the very expensive ticket.
7295,"Acting is fantastic - David Straithairn, Jon Hamm and in a one - scene keeper Jeff Daniels - Franco keeps things moving so well with his performance, and the poem is given it's best context in personal and social history. At the same time it's a quasi-biopic on Allen Ginsberg, who was a real free spirit, but also a shy Jewish kid from New York city who lost his mother as a child and worried about writing poems that might irk the ire of his father (he even considered not publishing Howl for that reason). The filmmakers bring together the poetic readings - done by James Franco, one of his real 'em bodiment' performances like Saul in Pineapple Express that is basically stunning - from in front of a live audience (where one sees how Ginsberg at first has an audience patient and waiting and then is full of life and looking forward to every next thing he says) and in animation. Acted out interviews illuminate many things and the trial itself is extremely involving to watch. It's well - done and well - acted, and no excuses are made for anything about Ginsberg or his work."
7296,"The primary "" conflict "" in the movie is Joaquin's discomfort with the pressures on him and the risks he is taking in the face of so many expectations to keep producing the kinds of movies that won him accolades. Comparisons are easily made to works of Sacha Baron Cohen and Christopher Guest. Of course, the sad truth is that so many fine performers have indeed self - destructed in similar fashion. But if J. P. can deceive so many so easily, it is all the more a masterpiece. It is one of the best movies of the year and Phoenix's performance is probably one of the best and most interestingly inspired acting jobs as well."
7299,"It has everything you need for success. All of this happens at a snails pace and makes you wonder if Stone has seen the first film in 20 years. One of the most objectionable scenes was the appearance of Charlie Sheen as Bud Fox, the playboy, with a model on either arm, boasting about how much money he made when he sold Bluestar airlines, and completely betraying the important life lessons he had discovered by the end of the original film. The writing is fairly unpredictable then everything seems to be tied into a nice bundle near the end. In "" Wall Street, "" the scenes of trading and the under - handed behaviors were intense and fast."
7301,"There is a great amount of detail in the film, especially on the owls, you can see every feather, every movement they make, every gust of wind that brushes that pass their feathers. The owls look painstakingly well - rendered and they don't look too - clichÃ©d - cartoony or too - frighteningly - realistic. Director Zack Snyder (finally using his talents for the kids) puts his signature style to terrific use here, using the "" ramping "" (frantic slowing down and speeding up repeatedly) technique from his "" 300 "" and "" Watchmen "" for the action sequences, that will make one forget he is watching an animated film, let alone a movie that has talking owls. People go to the movies to be entertained, especially families, and with that this film delivers in spades. The visual designs are awesome and the music is beautiful, it is a great story."
7302,"Although his parents (Lauren Graham and Jim Gaffigan) are nice, they are a mildly over-achieving duo who try to gently push their teenage son in a certain direction. Fortunately, he soon makes friends with an affable patient named Bobby (Zach Galifianakis) and casts his eye on a lovely young female Noelle (Emma Roberts), who bears telltale scars on her wrists. Galifianakis, Roberts, Davis, and especially White, do great work too, as do all of the lesser actors. Comic relief provided by the excellent Zack Galifianakis. This is a good 2010 movie, with a low budget, low commercial expectations but with great feedback."
7626,"Human trafficking, especially if it involves a trusted world organization and its sleazy contractors, is an extremely important subject to cover and make films about; therefore, be ready to adjust uncomfortably in your seats as you watch downright disgusting and brutal activities perpetrated against teenage girls. The specific victims were fictionalized, but the overall story of what was happening and what Rachel Wiesz's character went through are true. Very quickly, she discovers the word monitor means turn a blind eye as Serbs, Croats, and Bosniaks abuse whatever power they have to continue a sort of undeclared war on each other. Nobody in any position of authority ever raises their hand for a scandal, so all of Kathryn's investigations and findings are swept under the rug and she is ostracized from the rest of her compatriots who are either not interested in obtaining justice for the girls or believe so much in bureaucracy and paperwork that they sometimes send the girls right back to their rapists. The director let the impact of the story itself, and Rachel Wiesz's fine acting, carry the movie."
7259,"Fear and shock are powerful emotions, and films are a safe and entertaining way of experiencing them. It may leave permanent scars in your mind that will ruin some of the best experiences of your life, such as witnessing the birth of your child or lying in bed caressing a son's hair. What's insane is that this movie is REALLY well made; Some very impressive camera work, disgustingly sharp and mean spirited dialogue, a believable cast and some serious nailbiter scenes. A man is shown violently anally raping (onscreen) a young child - his own son, after he is injected with massive doses of a powerful sexual stimulant. The cinematography is well done and there are some nice, dark and creepy moments here."
7307,"While the remake seemed to take a greater interest in the horrific violence, the original had the perfect blend of genres (thriller, romance, horror, fantasy). The child actors, Chloe Moretz (Kick - Ass) and Kodi Smit - McPhee (The Road) were both excellent choices. The acting by Richard Jenkins and Elias Koteas was spot on and authentic, as could be expected and cannot be overlooked. The orchestral music furthered the intensity and seriousness of Abby's need to feed, and protect, but the classic rock tunes from the era echoed the universal teenage experience of social rebellion and awkward sexual curiosity. The acting in LMI is award worthy, especially Chloe Moretz as Abby, who's acting is amazing and makes the film's most complex character work."
7249,"As with the best family films, though, adults will love this story as much - if not more - than their little ones. The nepotistic supporting cast from Saturday Night Live (even Jack McBrayer works for Tina Fey) is fantastic. One pleasant surprise was from Gru's minions: they did not steal the show. Nestled in between the easy laughs however is ample heart and if you are prone to do so, you may very well shed a tear or two. After a fresh - faced rival villain Vector (Jason Segel) outdoes Gru by stealing a pyramid from Egypt, he devises a plan to obtain a shrink - ray from a government testing facility and use that technology to shrink, and then steal the moon."
7308,"The movie is so safe and there wasn't anything safe about the facts that surround this horse and his rise to be the greatest race horse that ever lived. Again, it is a good movie with some interjections of great cinematography, yet Secretariat was a GREAT horse and deserved a GREAT movie. With the success and quality of production that came with 2003's Seabiscuit, it was perhaps inevitable that someone would turn their hand to making a film about a horse that many agree is the greatest American horse of all time. Every masterpiece must have its extreme contrasts to fulfill the emotional needs of its audience. The photography is bracing, often putting the camera right by the prancing hoofs or mid-level close to the steed's haunches."
7243,"The actors were dismal, with the exception of Dev Patel as Zuko and to a lesser extent Shaun Toub as Iroh, who wasn't an accurate portrayal of Iroh visually but at least captured the character's wisdom much better than many of the other actors on board for the movie. And it's an incredible primer for Eastern spiritual ideals and mythology. So beautifully wrought is this story that the fun, action and struggles are adeptly punctuated with moving poignancy."
7310,"All in all, this is surely not the best of Shyamalan's movies but way better than the last stuff he has done before this movie. Every character has a very unique and special behaviour and something interesting to hide even if the characters could have been more developed if the movie had maybe twenty minutes more running time. All of which is too bad because not only is Devil a compelling, riveting bit of movie making, but Shyamalan's involvement was limited to writing the story and co-producing, which, given his recent track record, was probably for the best. The acting was surprisingly consistent and good throughout by all the actors involved (tough for a low budgeter to achieve), the screenplay didn't indulge in unnecessary Boo moments to propel things forward, the script was solid and everything tied up well at the end. He concentrated on the script and preferred to let other people direct the movie and so you might expect that this first part of Shyamalan's renaissance must be a well elaborated and twisted masterpiece."
7311,"Sigourney Weaver, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kristen Bell and Odette Yustman all shine on - screen in their own ways, yet complement each other so well. If you're looking for a fun, positive family film with lots of laughs, you've found your movie. But Marni bucks up and uses the bullying she experienced as a goad toward achievement after graduation. Marni's mother (Jamie Lee Curtis) is sympathetic, but tells Marni that high school is in the past and she needs to move on. Despite the happy occasion that has gathered the family together, Marni is less than thrilled."
7312,"The two leads are charming, believable and goes well together. Josh Duhamel and Katherine Heigl were good eye candy throughout the movie, and the baby (like most) was absolutely adorable. This is a lovely new entry into the world of romantic comedies, for all of the genre's dedicated fans. Heigl and Duhamel are perfectly wonderful as the main couple, although both are such pros in this type of film that they should probably try to "" branch out "" in their next projects or be stuck in this kind of thing forever. Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel are awesome, and have a natural chemistry."
7313,"With the authentic camcorder cinematography and relatable cast of twenty - something - years - old New York guys who share the common human vice of an over-curious mind, one might also assume the film would be the long - anticipated, non-supernatural version of The Blair Witch Project or Paranormal Activity. Like most people, most of your excitement stemmed from the two - minute masterpiece of a preview or maybe the ambiguous two - sentence synopsis dangled in front of your noses. Yaniv will send pictures to Abby, and is told Abby paints them with remarkable talent. The gradual rationing of information and the introduction and unraveling of the central mystery is surprisingly well handled. Some scenes are fiction, but somethings are authentic."
7314,"Hopkins and Bandiaras are playing variants of role they have played many times before, which suggests that, if nothing else, you are better off watching those performances, not these. Conveyed with such fabulous performances, particularly from Gemma Jones, and as is often the case with Allen, one heck of a script, Allen creates the perfect atmosphere. His favorite and constant themes of lives and deaths of the relationships, of growing older and refusing to accept it, of trying to postpone the inevitable meeting with a "" tall dark stranger "", of struggle to find the reason in a tale, "" full of sound and fury "", are all here. Most of the performances are excellent. Their lives change when Helena meets a widower that is her twin soul and Alfie finds that he is a cuckold and Charmaine is pregnant."
7315,"Within 5 short years they went from picture perfect to poverty, the only success stories probably laughed about over drinks and cigars. The production of it was crisp, clean and too the point following a well thought out introduction and ending, but you sure do end up hating capitalism by the time the ending credits start to roll. Then bring back the stringent regulation that gave the industry forty years of reasonable corporate success before Reagan era deregulation. Various economic professors who are brought from institutions of higher learning to "" advise "" the government and then return to their teaching jobs aren't â€” for baffling reasons â€” prohibited from making profit off the policies they recommend. Many major players appeared on camera to their detriment."
7333,"It has some good action scenes which look great in 3D but if not, you aren't missing a lot. Really love to see how people can still come up with good and original stories that still have a happy ending, much like the latest Shrek movie. The animation is great but what gets this film 4 stars is the fact that while the animation adds to the movie, it is only one aspect of the film's appeal. At some point he reasons that if he is treated like a bad kid, that he might as well be a bad kid, and "" MegaMind, incredibly handsome criminal genius and master of all villainy! "" Megamind is also pretty even handed."
7316,"While there have been plenty of valid comparisons made between this film and last year's sci - fi hit District - 9 (due solely to the fact that the two films share an admittedly similar global concept; that of aliens landing and being contained within a restricted zone as a forced but entertaining allegory for racial disharmony. It is essential that the two leads be well crafted in order for this method to work. Thankfully then, they are; Hitting that perfect ratio of realism, stereotype, flaw and likability. They are the kind of characters that you would happily follow within the comparatively banal confines of a drama and so here, in this realm of heightened stakes, they become doubly interesting. While you don't see much of the monsters, you can always feel their presence."
7317,"What's more, it's seamless, from the superb performances by Carey Mulligan, Keira Knightley, and Andrew Garfield, to the near perfect direction by Romanek, to its gorgeous cinematography with muted color palette, to its precise wabi - sabi production design (the beauty of worn and broken things). If you enjoyed Todd Haynes' lovely melodrama, Far from Heaven, or Oren Moverman's powerful movie, The Messenger, or Tom Ford's poignant film, A Single Man, you'll love this picture. The story addresses themes of love, longing, jealousy, betrayal, courage, atonement, and perhaps most important "" acceptance . "" One final note: Keira Knightley and Andrew Garfield are excellent in their roles, but Carey Mulligan is the standout--she shows a wisdom and weariness far beyond her years, and handles difficult emotional material with a sublime restraint that makes the whole thing work. The film opens in the 1970's, focusing on the lives of three school children in an English private school."
7318,"The film follows the travels of a French Illusionist from town to town looking for work while performing his artistic magician craft in small shows. The animation is 2D brilliance with every image on the screen having deeper meaning of some sort. Contemporary film seems to be all about glamor, special effects, and money leading to the creation of hit or miss films. Your eye was skilfully drawn to the right places by use of colour placement. The film is directed by Sylvain Chomet, the man probably best known for his 2003 animated art - house feature The Triplets of Belleville."
7320,"It's a stylish (with vivid colors you can eat with a spoon), funny, sexy, college - set CLUELESS - on - acid that morphs into a cross between Sergio Martino's ALL THE COLORS OF THE DARK and THE WIZARD OF OZ after a horny, existentialistic film student begins to realize he may be at the center of a global conspiracy with cataclysmic consequences. The liberal, mixed sex scenes were both interesting and fun and the attitude that good sex is just that, refreshing. In the end it's very hard to care about who does what and why, so basically you'll just end up waiting to see who's going to have sex with whom, (basically everyone seems bed down with just about everyone else in this movie despite their gender differences) and yet, none of the sex never has anything to do with the story. Some great performances to be fair, but a bad film that isn't bad enough to be worth recommending. The photography is great, the colours seem like over-saturated, giving everything a very intense and almost surreal aura, which is exactly what it's supposed to have."
7321,"The real star of the show is Stephen Spinella as Lieutenant Chad, the world weary law - man who is convinced it's all a show and that the movie would be over if the audience just went away. Pay very close attention to every scene with the bystanders on the road and you will realize that the killer tire story is not the actual plot at all. They get creative when shooting scenes with the tire, they make the killer tire really seem to have a mind of it's own. This film will take you on a journey through an unimaginable, inexplicable, but fantastic life of a tire that goes by the name of Robert. Also, on second viewing, you can revel in the brilliant personification of the killer tire (Robert)."
7322,"While watching it you will go through a whole case of emotions, from anger, distraught, disgust to the feeling of love a father has for his daughter. This movie hits you like a tonne of bricks and keeps you on the edge until the very end. Claude Legault (Bruno) and RÃ©my Girard (HervÃ©) did an incredible job with the acting. There is one scene in particular that showcases the raw talent Legault and Mallette have. "" 7 Days "" may not be the cream of the crop of revenge flicks, but it does succeed where others fail."
7323,"Oh yeah, he's also wearing roller skates. (The 3D definitely sold the film.) Indeed, when a prosthetic sex toy flies in slo - mo through several different iconic landmarks and finally shatters a glass of milk, the joy of seeing it in the additional dimension is enough to convince you that "" Jackass "" was meant for 3D. Jackass 3D is notable as well for its use of stereoscopic 3D cinematography. The set piece stunts are in bright and crisp 3D that really adds to the effect of whatever they are trying to do."
7324,"If you see it on DVD, don't miss the interviews shown under special features. The mix of soldiers is a bit different than it was when there was a draft, but "" Restrepo "" shows that American forces still bring a wide range of backgrounds and reactions. What Sebastian Junger & Tim Hetherington have captured with this doc may be the final word about soldiers in combat & their thoughts afterword. The interviews interlaced among the field footage are as riveting as the fighting. It is filled with interviews, but the bulk of the movie is truly documenting the lives of these soldiers."
7387,"But then two figures, who are kind of blobs with eyes and noses and mouths, appear as the day and night fill up their bodies? Best is when the' Night' figure looks on at' Day' as a bunch of girls in bikinis (and one just sunning herself) are by a pool, but then when he / it looks on him / itself, the pool is closed. Therefore, they enjoy watching various scenes, for example building's illumination, watching movie, which is road show, flying show, fire works and woman bathing swimsuit. First, they fought with, but they found good point of each other and enjoyed watching scenes as if they are children. If you have been following the story, Pixar gave the rights to Toy Story sequels to Disney as part of the original deal."
7325,"The test scores from other countries, particularly Asian countries, are skewed since they are used as tracking for academic and social class for life. For a detailed explanation, please read Tamin Ansary's article "" The Myth of America's Failing Schools . "" The vast majority (90%) in most schools are dedicated and diligent professionals who do the very best they can with the circumstances they have. They were educated, lived in nice, clean, and well maintained apartments, and did homework with their children each night. This stirring documentary sends out shock - waves of injustice and even a bit of a sense of futility when it explores the state of America's public schools."
7326,"Throughout the film he maintains a carefree poker - face, as though he's done this so many times over the years that he can afford to be relaxed. There are valid attempts at making Willis seem more normal, and these can be quite amusing. The action scenes are really good but it's the characters and actors that makes this film worth seeing. If you miss the classic Bruce Willis Action Comedies this one makes up for all the bad ones in recent years. But what really makes this film worth seeing in theatres with an audience is John Malkovich!"
7327,"The trailer was pretty clever in only showing the audience's screams and members hiding under their coats and covering their eyes. The family starts to hear noises and see items fall or move on their own. There are some genuinely creepy moments, one of the biggest being when Kristi is sitting in the kitchen and BAM (!) The film starts with a close nit family, a new born baby and of course the house pet, the family suffers a break - in and install cameras in case it happens again. Here was an audience, who expected the new film to be with a new family, to have new scares and to have a whole new perception on watching horror films alone."
7328,"Eastwood has the assured hand that allows long segments in French with English subtitles and a juncture with two disasters and such a touchy - feely subject, and yet it works. And with Hereafter, it seems that all Mr. Eastwood wants to do is share a story. Instead, Hereafter deals with its subject with great integrity and subtlety. Although, despite said subtlety, it features a few moments which are, by contrast, incredibly intense and shocking (in a non-scary way). CÃ©cile de France is really impressive, she plays her part with great dignity and empathy."
7329,"Medieval scholars will probably find substantial problems with the film's depiction of the Middle Ages, but to a non-historian it certainly feels closer than many other period movies: buildings are mostly squalid and insubstantial, the weapons and armor of the soldiers are crude and ill - assorted - Ulric (Sean Bean), the bishop's envoy, has the best of everything, while his followers are progressively less well - equipped as they descend the social scale - and it gives a good sense of the unwelcoming, sparsely - populated landscapes of medieval Britain. Even his soldiers are not one - dimensional brutes, but have their own personalities, with subtly - sketched human traits. Any film - maker who wants to truly convey the feel of the Middle Ages - brutal and squalid, and at once alien and familiar - should watch "" Black Death "" and take notes. True enough to say that following a chainmail clad Sean Bean and his grungy band of "" mercs "" traverse the land, fighting off bandits and the plague along the way, is good formulaic fun, but it's when they happen upon the marshy set village, greeted by a ghostly Carice van Houten and a unnervingly smiley Tim McInnerny, that the film really hits its stride. Eddie Redmayne does well in the central role of Osmund and manages to make his character's personal journey both interesting and believable, whilst Carice van Houten is also memorable in an important role during the second half of the movie."
7330,"The 3D was pretty poor to be honest, was way too gimmicky and just involved chunks of bone and flesh fly at you. The traps continue to be inventive, although some â€“ like the face trap â€“ make welcome returns. Overall, the only positive thing about Saw 3D is that the franchise is finally over. On one hand, it is without any doubt, the standout sequence of Saw 3D. Instead of focusing on any of these characters for longer than a few seconds at the time, the film pays attention mostly to Flanery's character and a new detective, Gibson (Chad Donella)."
7331,"Another example of such a role being done to perfection is Jack Lemmon in The Out of Towners. Given Downey's well documented real - life problems, his statement in the movie couldn't help but make the audience compare the character to reality, thus serving to knock down the "" 4th wall "" in the process. As Steve Martin, John Candy, and Jack Lemmon proved, superior comedy and deeper laughs come from brilliant acting and comic timing. But thanks to a bag mixup with a fellow traveler named Ethan Trembley (Zach Galifianakis), Peter finds himself stranded in Atlanta, placed on the national No Fly list (minor misunderstanding, of course). Downey, Jr. and Galifianakis give it their best shot, and to tell the truth they're not bad."
7332,"But everything leading up to Aron's life - altering decision is absolutely amazing and the stuff of pure filmmaking magic. They work rather brilliantly as asides, as mere stylishly and crazily edited set pieces (a naked party in the back of an SUV is a particular standout). They are among the film's few scenes of character interaction, and help the audience adjust deeper and deeper into Ralston's mindset. Not many actors are able to drive a film by mainly interacting with themselves and the static objects around them, but Franco delivers in spades at every turn. It is authentically emotional, and in a year merely punctuated with a handful of amazing movies amongst a sea of filth, it more than just stands out."
7334,"With competition arriving in the form of new dancer Lily (Mila Kunis), and the demanding desire for perfection from both Thomas and her overbearing mother Erica (Barbara Hershey), Nina begins a journey into dark uncharted territory. He builds up rather slow, but right after that first moment of off - the - rails insanity, he delivers one hell of an incredible piece of cinema. Even the scenery and set design is in plain black and whites, always making the audience guess the true motivations and intentions of both character and creator. Rather gracefully, Aronofsky manages to balance the goal of Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin's script to blend Nina's tale with the story of Swan Lake itself, and never loses sight or direction at any instance. Portman, who has shown her acting merits before in the likes of Closer, delivers a startlingly intense and beautiful performance as Nina."
7335,"One of the major events that President George W. Bush will undoubtedly be remembered for in history will be his decision to declare war on Iraq in 2003. "" Fair Game "" places itself right in the middle of these controversial events between 2002 and 2004, and is told through the eyes of CIA Agent Valerie Plame (played very convincingly by Naomi Watts) and her husband, United Nations Ambassador Joe Wilson (played fiercely by the always great Sean Penn). As the film starts, Plame and Wilson appear to be a very loving couple with a very strong marriage - they even have 2 small children who live with them in the D. C. area. Watts doe a very good job with her role portrayal of hard shelled Valerie Plame. She is able to create the stubborn exterior of Plame while showing her emotional side deep within."
7337,"Based on the real - life story of an unmanned train that went careening down the tracks in Ohio after a railroad employee failed to set the air brakes while switching tracks, this dramatization of that little incident amps up the thrills for a white - knuckle 100 - minute non-stop roller - coaster ride - just think of it as an adrenaline shot that pretty much grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go from start to finish. Tony Scott and Denzel Washington's latest collaboration is pretty much the definition of high concept - a runaway freight train loaded with thousands of gallons of diesel fuel, eight carriages of a highly toxic chemical and a worryingly curvy track ahead of it, versus two train operatives armed with little in the way of stopping impending disaster bar a one - car locomotive and their vivid imaginations. and you have all the ingredients required for an edge of the seat action thriller There are very good acting performances also by the supporting cast, namely Rosario Dawson as Connie Hooper the senior train dispatcher who does an admirable job in keeping the tension up and she is the "" glue "" that holds all the dialogue, characters and plot lines together Choosing to film the high - octane action sequences in a more straightforward realistic manner than his usual flashy visual style (i. e. jump cuts, shaky camera, zooms and colour - correction) also lends the proceedings an authentic and an altogether genuinely riveting feel, further underlining the gravity of their heroic act. Unfolding at a breathless pace, Tony Scott makes the most of a simple premise to deliver a relentlessly exciting action movie that plays like "" Speed "" on tracks."
7338,"Rachel McAdams is what makes this movie so likable and cute. As the story progresses she has countless obstacles she must overcome and a high amount of stress that comes with the job. There are many comical scenes as the producer is practically at wits end during the main duration of the movie. Adding to the mix and a lot of credibility, Jeff Goldblum, Dianne Keaton, and Harrison Ford, looking every bit his 60 + years, but still has a boyishness to his demeanor that hearkens back to Star Wars and Indiana Jones. Patrick Wilson is the rom in "" rom - com "" and he holds his ground against the whirling dervishness of Rachel's character."
7339,"If you have seen Under The Olive Tree, Kiarostami's master piece from 1994, you might find Certified Copy to be the continuation 25 years later on a different continent. Kiarostami's film looks beautiful and uses it's location to great effect, without becoming a postcard travelogue. You might think that, with the supposed paucity of good female roles in movies, that there's not much left for Binoche to cover that she hasn't before, but here she gets to explore some new territory to Cannes best actress award - winning effect. It's a very simple film on the surface, the plot made up almost entirely of a day - long conversation between an author (William Shimell) and a woman (Juliette Binoche) showing him around town. William Shimell was the perfect choice for the distant, simple author."
7340,"There are a couple of especially good moments. Very entertaining all the way through from start to finish with no gaps which is always good for a film that exceeds 2 hours in duration. There didn't seem to be any implausible leap in logic apart from maybe towards the end but everything just connects together so well. The Next Three Days The best films are those where you are introduced to characters who do the unpredictable believably, or people you think will be key players die in the opening scene, someone you least expect turns out to be the murderer, these are the films that keep you guessing and keep you involved. So in summary, this is a top thriller with an exhilarating edge of the seat 3rd act, enriched by beautifully touching moments and thick underlying subtext of undying love."
7341,"He also displays an uncanny knack for milking suspense out of scenes - in particular, Harry, Hermoine and Ron's daring raid on the Ministry of Magic and their subsequent visit to Godric's Hollow, Harry's birthplace and home to Bathilda Bagshot, a magician and dear friend to Dumbledore. Speaking of adult actors, Nick Morran's Scabior is a delightful character - he's slightly perverted and he has a bit of a Jack Sparrow vibe going on. What happened to the great choices Harry has to make, like does he go after the Horcruxes as Dumbledore instructed or does he get sidetracked looking for the Deathly Hallows? It is a movie that has characters with the same names and faces but they are in an alternative universe, one created by David Yates starting in movie 5. "" Deathly Hallows Part 1 "" follows the book closely, but misses out on a few interesting scenes, and then makes up a few additional scenes that are poignant and incredibly welcome."
7342,"Geoffrey Rush, Helena Bonham Carter, Derek Jacobi, and Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill, all turn in excellent performances. Mr. Firth gives one of the most poignant and affective performances ever by a male movie star. Colin Firth in the role as King George VI is really good, and he is completely convincing as a man who struggles with different things, such as his temperament, memories from his childhood and of course: his stammering. His undeclared needs reflected in Colin Firth's eyes are a prodigious acting feast. They got access to Lionel's diaries and correspondence and managed to incorporate some of it into the script."
7343,"The 3D is worth going to. There is enough silliness, adventure, and romance to allow boys and girls of almost all ages to love this show. There were some funny lines in the show that kids would not understand, but adults would enjoy. Repunzel is your typical Disney princess style character: sweet, funny, etc. . This movie is an instant classic, and a near perfect example of what animated fairy tales should be like if they want to appeal to a wide range of viewers, not just tween girls."
7603,"See it if you can, its definitely a hauntingly beautiful film that makes you think long after the credits roll. Regardless of how you feel about the inevitable outcome, the struggles presented on screen is one of the more complex modern love stories. The cold, stark and stunning set locations are as much a part of the story telling as the dialogue is, serving to enrich the feelings and situations conveyed by the characters."
7345,"It's not really his fault, David O. Russell packed the film with a lot of talent. In terms of boxing films, it works. Thank goodness the film makes up for this with the performances from Bale and Leo. The Fighter features great music, engaging performances and a predictable, yet true story. Just a wonderfully well made film with terrific performances."
7346,"And, Anna Pacquin, who is so good and fiery in True Blood, is left with little to do except be a bitch. Film keeps you interested in the proceedings - and it is surprisingly well shot for a first time filmmaker--several lovely scenes of the characters outdoors here. Performances are fine, but not spectacular, apologies owed to the supporting actors who don't have characters to hang a portrayal around. The great conflict at the middle of the picture is a love triangle between Katie Holmes, Anna Paquin, and Josh Duhamel, but you care so little about these three people that you'd just as soon see them end up alone."
7241,"All this saga was calculated on 12 - 15 years old teenager girls, which love to watch Crap like this. The werewolves have got some excellent CGI going for them and at first glance you wouldn't be able to guess that they aren't real. , they actually had fun with the script and that's what picked up the film as well as better action scenes."
7348,"Although Tillman was certainly a hero, the moments leading to his death did not involve him fighting off Taliban soldiers like the government had said, he was actually killed by friendly fire."
7499,"It is certain to receive high praise from those who enjoy psychological thrillers. The Perfect Host is a little film that slips under the radar, but if you enjoy good thrillers, want a different take on the home invasion genre, just enjoy watching David Hyde Pierce (and he is most watchable) being creepy, then it's well worth a look. With that said, THE PERFECT HOST is sadly going to get overlooked with all the blockbusters out there but hopefully people will give the film a chance as it's certainly a good little gem. His character does so many odd things but Pierce makes you believe everything you're seeing and the amount of charm, charisma and personality that he brings to the film really makes this character his very own. If you like David Hyde Pierce in Frasier then this character is much darker but just as funny."
7350,"Farrell plays Mitchell, fresh from prison and determined to go straight, within half - an - hour, he has been offered a choice of two jobs. This film was brimming with potential, an adept cast, some stylish directing & gritty yet beautiful set locations. The movie had promise - directed by The Departed's writer William Monahan and starring an eclectic bunch of British stars Colin Farrell, Keira Knightly, Ray Winstone, David Thewlis and Anna Friel."
7351,"While slightly more successful in causing some injury to the aliens, their ultimate futility is seen when what looks to be an incredibly agile stealth bomber dances and dodges its way through aerial combat to release the Hail - Mary tactical nuke missile even as it is finally shot down. The actors best moments come when they convey the despair and frustration of seeing every soap - bubble of hope unavoidably popped. Earth is a rich and rare cache of resources presumably not found in many places in the vast, cold reaches of space. Basically the aliens and each confrontation against them are generally exciting and save the film."
7594,"Quite an interesting movie, set in kind of an origami environment which is quite unique, has some shiny action moments. Watch it and enjoy the art of making movies as moving pictures. It's beautifully made, switches visual styles, languages and mood a lot and does so convincingly. At its heart is a rather simple story of hero - strangers who roll into an oppressed town to start trouble with the oppressors. GACKT has some background in martial arts, and it is easy to see as he fights - he has a certain grace and precision, while Hartnett is a brawling powerhouse of Western dime novels."
7237,"It is a special movie, one of the best movies of all - time. What is so masterful about Shrek is its ambiguity. Despite the film's pessimistic outlook, it is studded by moments of joy, beauty and emotional truth. The characters that populate the "" Shrek "" universe remain as endearing as ever in principle, but after four movies there is little that can be done to keep them animated, so to speak. The original gang all return along with Shrek and Fiona."
7354,"In the end the film works better than others of its genre and its worth a look (probably not for a first date) but if you are already on a relationship it will give you something to think and talk about. Love & Other Drugs is a feel good film that's enjoyable it touches emotions leaves you happy and you don't feel any side effects only love in the end. Both forces are hard at work in this film, but the tipping point goes in favor thanks to the leads, Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway. Most of all it proves that sex and hot passion can easy lead to strong emotions of feeling and yes you guessed it as this film proves love. The absence of Anne Hathaway's character Maggie in the first segment of the film is the first suggestion that this will not be a routine paint by numbers romance and Maggie's introduction sets the scene for the complex character she successfully portrays."
7355,"Sure Ben Barnes was great eye candy in this movie but other than that there wasn't anything to enjoy. "" Voyage "" is actually a very enjoyable film for both kids and adults alike. The adventures were really great and breathtaking and should be a good way to take people's spare time. Its story is understandable for young kids and its characters are enjoyable and fun to befriend with especially the mouse, Reepicheep. "" Voyage "" is also powerful in exciting action scenes."
7356,"Dunham is very talented and there are great scenes in this movie but the rave reviews are waaaaay over the top. Two years ago she graduated from Oberlin College and then floated around producing her own small - time web shows. She then writes her first screenplay, raises $25K in cash from friends and family, conscripts her mother and sister to act in the film and shoots a good part of it in her parents' apartment. The film begins with Aura returning from college where she created some artsy videos that made a small splash on campus. The two men are pretty basic caricatures, much like herself - Jed (Alex Karpovsky), who has achieved moderate internet fame thanks to his Youtube videos and Keith (David Call), who works at the same restaurant Aura does."
7357,"The director, German born - Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (Director of the Academy Award winning film The Lives of Others) also was a replacement and who he himself dropped out at one point, only to resume his directorial role later on. The plot was your typical action movie: Someone's money gets stolen, they want it back, someone will get killed if it isn't returned, there's some romance, good guy wins. They must have thought "" a big Hollywood movie with Jolie, Depp and the director of "" The Lives Of Others "" what a break! The Tourist stars Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp in what appears to be a very promising plot. Lives, a sober but suspenseful crafted work dealing with the dreaded Stasi in drab East Germany was everything this sloppy escapist drivel isn't."
7358,"The movie is very enjoyable to watch and easy to recommend to families to watch (families who have kids at least 13 years old). The acting is great, especially Pietari's (Onni Tommila) performance is great. With a couple of good twists and a sprinkle of humour thrown in the mix. Very creepy in parts, but with a very enjoyable streak of black comedy, this movie is a must see. com / 2010 / 12 / rare - exports - Christmas - tale."
7360,"The strength of the movie as a story lies in its focus on a web of characters and their relationships to one another, rather than on the crimes themselves. Since much of the real life story is still a mystery, Jarecki does a nice job in assembling pieces from the trial records. The film relates incidents that began in 1972 and end in 2003 and at this time the truth is still unknown."
7361,"Carter Burwell, whose previous work for the Coens is simply sublime, gives yet another stellar score, creating just the right mood and tempo. Accents are also very important â€“ the harsh Southern drawl that the Coens have always been attracted to is very prominent and plays a very large role in the film. You will enjoy it as long, as your expectations aren't too high. Hailee Steinfeld is quite engaging, and Matt Damon develops an intriguing complexity that makes one wish he had more screen - time. Though the original has the classic, big, sweeping score by Elmer Bernstein that many westerns of the day were accustomed to, it just didn't fit the story."
7362,"A science fiction movie made by Disney seems interesting enough especially when it's live - action and targeted for kids (Disney targets its movies for kids, right?) everything a good movie should be. The Lightcycles in the film and all the things in the world of Tron, displayed in 3D were awesome. It's a real treat for the eyes, and it's even better in 3D which is splendidly used to flesh out the dimensions and graphics of the cyber world bring you even deeper into the world instead of things merely flying out to you and post-production conversion like in SO many 3D movies (Note that in the 3D version, there's a disclaimer before the film starts, saying that parts of the film are filmed in both natural 2D and 3D as they way they should be. But the ultimate piece of symbolism that outmatches anything else in the movie, is the final attempt of CLU to get Flynn's disc."
7363,"Mike Leigh's latest film Another Year follows the story of a happily married couple approaching their retirement years. Their friends and family, by contrast, all struggle to some extent with unhappiness, and a sense that their best years may be behind them. Rut Sheen's role as Gerri is superb. Jim Broadbent's Tom is charming and self - effacing, confident in his own happiness yet nonplussed at the failure of his friend Ken â€“ Peter Wight â€“ to come to terms with growing old. and film goers are the benefactors of his daring."
7364,"Moving on, as said above, this is not a movie to make you lol or rofl, merely a movie to be enjoyed from watching these character's journey of self - revelation's throughout. For a similar story line, but far superior film, go re-watch When Harry Met Sally for the eighteenth time. Terms of Endearment, Broadcast News, and As Good As it Gets are all insightful dramadies that bring real life into relationships. This is a worthy addition to the very short list of great romantic comedies, and one which will grow in reputation through the years. but she has such a big heart that she bakes and labels multiple dinners for George."
7365,"The film does not hold back Barney's flaws as he is very foul mouthed, speaks his mind (whether you want him to, or not), drinks, smokes cigars and a lot of the time is an ego centric jerk. Barney's Version is a revelation of a film, packed with a great story, excellent dialogue and even better performances. Giamatti's character--although a cad in some ways--manages to also be quite endearing, and character development in the whole movie is excellent. If you want to give yourself a chance to be introspective about your own path and the choices you've made in the various parts of your life you'll find this movie to be very moving. Giamatti has got to be the plainest looking leading man out there; yet, his acting ability transcends his anti-matinÃ©e idol physiognomy by a significant amount."
7366,"This is a solidly entertaining and believable film about professional men (and women) who lose their identities as they lose their jobs in corporate America economic decline. Bottom line: Solid entertainment with very few explosions. Plus McClary is a very conflicted man he's stressed plus he's cheating on his wife with a company employee the sexy and elegant Sally Wilcox (Maria Bello). Overall good film that captures the reality of the corporate and economic recessions of the last few years it's so true of how companies do downsizing of their men which alters and changes lives forever. While the story is difficult to watch, the performances by this exceptional cast are excellent, not only among the Oscar winning stars but by the finely wrought cameos by Anthony O'Leary as Bobby's son Drew, Cady Huffman, and Eamonn Walker (so well remember from the TV series OZ), among many others."
7236,"Winter's Bone is a stark, almost documentary - like movie about a poor teenage girl named Ree in the Ozarks who supports her near - catatonic mother and two younger siblings during her meth - cooking father's many brushes with the law. This effect was heightened by some excellent performances; especially from Jennifer Lawrence and John Hawkes (Teardrop). The sparse, beautiful winter settings are a perfect backdrop for the story. The moments of happiness are small, fleeting, and poignant; like a gift of generosity from a neighbor who knows you're in need, or the quiet assurances of an older sister to her younger siblings. The performances, likely coaxed by this great director, stun you silent."
7368,"There is nothing pleasant or "" cool "" about these scenes; they make the viewer uncomfortable, they unsettle, they bring one's mind into very dark places. Beautiful cinematography contrasts the stark, dimly lit scenes where the murders, or gritty fight scenes, occur. They compliment each other very well, and play off of each others strengths effectively. Lee's character experiences a profound loss at the hands of Choi's character, and in the process of seeking revenge begins to resemble the man he so hates. Lee's character is quiet and much less expressive, but he does very well in showing immense amounts of emotion through just his eyes or subtle movements of his body."
7369,"Even the title' Little Fockers' would have been a good indicator that the main objective and jokes would have centred around the kids but the truth is they have very little screen time in the film. Back in 2000, Meet The Parents was looked upon as one of the funniest movies ever. The gangs all here again to perform a series of unfunny sketches unfunnily and leave the audience paralysed with laughter. Contrivances and predictable story lines litter "" Fockers "" and damper the occasional moments of humor."
7370,"Some of the fun scenes with the tiny Lilliputians really work. It ain't pop culture references heaven but definitely delivers the goods (also some Avatar references were funny). Gulliver's Travels is fun, a fantasy, not taking itself seriously light comedy. You will spend an hour and a half watching an enjoyable family film that doesn't pretend to be anything more than a fun adaptation of an age old tale by Jonathan Swift. Turning Gulliver's Travels into a 3D movie seemed like an excellent idea"
7556,"It goes from warm, joyous, and simple with its pallet of vibrant colors, to cold, dreary, and a pessimistic tone with its darker pallet as time goes on. The Myth Of The American Sleepover is an honest and affirmative coming of age film that resonates. "" Myth of the America Sleepover "" is an independent drama that won a Special Jury Award at the 2010 South by Southwest Film Festival for Best Ensemble cast. It's dark, yes, but even the darkest of comedies have their moments of wit and passion."
7372,"There is a nice touch of comedy here and there from Alan Cumming, Stanley Tucci, and a very cute and well done scene between Aguilera and Gigandet that involves a nice shot of Gigandet's bottom and another mishap in that scene that will make anyone crave "" the box of cookies "" at that exact moment. Moving on, another aspect is the movie has got excellent, sparkly costumes during some flashy, risquÃ© sequences that could possibly make anyone have a seizure who was not thoroughly prepared. All the participants turn in great performances. It set out to be a fun romp with some sexy outfits and entertaining song numbers and it delivered. Stanley Tucci certainly steals the show while Cam Gigandet provides some delicious eye candy."
7374,"It just seemed to get everything pretty much right. The visual artistry was quite beautiful, with a great deal of invention in the scenes where the little Borrowers navigate through the wide expanses of the house they live underneath. And these images and sounds were combined together into a simple narrative that had an enormous amount of heart to it. "" Kari - gurashi no Arietti "" is a beautiful and melancholic tale of friendship between different ones. The conclusion is open despite the message of hope, since the fates of Sho and Arrierry and her family are inconclusive."
7375,"While the films it's ripping are pretty foul, T+D still manages to have a lot of heart, and Labine's character is so adorable! The acting is excellent, the story is awesome, the special f / x are spectacular, everything about this movie is just Awesome! Also, the direction of the new, but highly committed director Eli Craig shines as he directs the film he co-wrote and has been trying to get made for 4 years, and that love of the material shines. Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk are the "" Hillbillies "" in this hilarious tale of prejudice and paranoia and they deliver performances that are grounded and authentic. How can a brilliant movie like this not make it to the big screen, yet movies like Season of the witch, Skyline, and Gulliver's Travels do."
7376,"So, please, people that come to criticize, please, go find a movie where you find something interesting for yourselves. For an extra treat see it in 3D; you will really feel like you are a part of the movie. Unlike most of the movies that resource to this mix, the cartoon characters blend well with the rest of the scene."
7377,"However, the movie proceeds with a soft and entertaining pace, maybe at some points too entertaining, the sparkling character of Rita O'Grady herself was invented in order to make the story more cinematographically involving. Rita O'Grady was so effective because she cut through the muck and made it what it really is. She was terrific in Happy - Go - Lucky, and even better here. In fact, it is based on the real life happenings in 1968 - only about 40 years ago. Supporting work is excellent from Bob Hoskins, Ms. Richardson, Daniel Mayes (as O'Grady's husband), Rupert Graves and Rosamund Pike (husband and wife on different teams) and the rest of the cast of women, as well as the Ford executives and Union leaders."
7379,"All of this despite the fact that he was: (1) widely considered to have perhaps the most gifted pop singing ability of his generation; (2) successful, after years of effort, in terms of industry acclaim - a Grammy, an Oscar, a decent recording contract with a top label, and at least two stellar albums -' Nilsson Schmilsson' (originals), and' A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night' (standards); and (3) very happily married (for the third time), with a lovely young family that he seemed to adore. It is a whimsical but honest look at one of the all - time great raconteurs, a fellow traveler with a coterie of out - sized personalities who largely burned brightly but briefly. Hey VH - 1, how about screening it on air, then maybe putting it out on DVD? Using archive footage, recordings and recollections from the great and good this extra long portrait is long overdue and rightly deserved. See it in the theatre, buy the DVD, and make sure some slow - on - the - uptake company [* cough SONY cough *] picks it up ASAP!"
7234,"For someone so presumably consumed with her looks, this is a surprising image that tells you this film is going to show you the real Rivers. One of the most enlightening, and in some ways off - putting, scenes in the film is when she gets heckled at a show in rural Wisconsin. "" Piece of Work "" also displays a strong if understated caring side to Rivers, particularly in scenes describing her kindness toward past and present employees and the continual badgering of her daughter, Melissa, concerning her smoking."
7382,"One of the hallmarks of a good film has to be how much love a writer director puts into the details and in this, it is clear Lee Sngmoo has nurtured this baby for a while: superb production, lovely setups and payoffs. Geoffrey Rush (Ronald, the drunk ex-robber) is an awesome actor who gave a great performance with some doses of humor! these kind of movies are much more enjoyable specially on the big screen. You can tell that the director loves Sergio Leone and Akira Kurosawa movies."
7233,"It has the laughs, magic and best of all the entertainment. It keeps both children and adults entertained. They are heroes who share the same values of team spirit, bonding and camaraderie. The technical aspects are again flawless. The toys are welcomed by Lotso Bear but sooner they discover that the children mistreat them."
7385,"Animals is very good, Politics is alright, and Fame is good, this was the fourth stand - up show for the successful writer and star of great shows and films, such as The Office, Extras, The Invention of Lying, The Ricky Gervais Show and Derek. Gervais started his career playing versions of himself and characters that are perceived as annoying bastards, he does continue this persona on stage, and it works fantastically well, this is a terrific funny show. Ricky Gervais was number 49 on The Comedians' Comedian, he was number 18 on Britain's Favourite Comedian, and he was number 11 on 100 Greatest Stand - Ups. Irrational, over-optimistic idealism is found in equal amounts in religions and Socialism; both are equally guilty of dismissing truths (i. e. science) in favour of whatever hallucinogenic scenario their wishful thinking imposes on them."
7232,"It's a crafty plan to lower your expectations. The A-Team, against all odds, is one extremely entertaining film. That's also savvy because it's also kind of a mess that would collapse under its own weight if it slowed down for more than two minutes. But like a comedy that never stops pitching jokes, content if only half of them stick, The A-Team pitches action, action, action, with a side of action and a little action to wash it down. Their wonderfully brash characters bring welcome levity to the pounding machine of gunfights and explosions that propels The A-Team."
7388,"Now, friends and admirers of his work are urging him to share his town, Marwencol, with the world, with a gallery showing, a book and this film. Mark Hogancamp is a sympathetic and interesting guy. Marwencol is definitely an interesting place. Deeply moving documentary about a man, Mark Hogancamp, who suffered a vicious beating at the hands of some thugs who followed him home from a bar. To deal with the pain, Mark created a fantasy world, a small Belgian town in the midst of WWII, Marwencol, populated with dolls which represent people from his own life."
7231,"Megan Foxes' role is small, and she serves every purpose, much like a smoking hot Bond girl. 58/100 You'll like it if you liked: Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer, Brotherhood of the Wolf, and Timecop."
7391,"The literary references throughout the movie such as the poet Coleridge and others was thought provoking and humorous at the same time. There are a fair few references to each others famous parts which were totally lost on the audience in NY (e. g. anything Alan Partridge related) but the rest of the film went down very well. There is also a lot of film and pop culture references to go along with the literary history thrown - about as the pair trek the highlands of some of Britian's late - greats (poets, writers, historians) and explore castles, manors and northern Moors. Comparisons to Alexander Payne's Sideways (2004) are genuine but this picture is largely improvised by the actors. A lot of the restaurant scenes are held for a very long time, which means that the decision to improvise is a smart one."
7393,"Hopefully this will inspire a perhaps much needed poetic view of this hypermodern world which can barely watch deliberate thoughtful meaningful measured movies like this, much less find and read a poem. Maybe this artistic beckon will even encourage someone to write one. Mija reveals such determination in her simple and peaceful going on, holding on, she proves the real strength of real strong people, that strength that does not need any evident outward demonstrations, but only the inner will of a meek nature who continues to see the beauty of a flower or the perfection of an apple, and the beauty of poetry, of course, against the ugliness of men (and here the ugliness of a male chauvinist society is to be underlined). "" Poetry "" is not for the average film viewer, but is for more mature audiences who are not afraid to confront life as it is and the existential aspects of life in general. Some of the most affecting scenes in the film are the discussions in the poetry class led by their teacher who tells them poetry does not require a special time or place or even inspiration, it only requires seeing the world as if for the first time and asks the class to share their memory of the most beautiful time in their life."
7229,"Spoof movies generally make fun of serious movies, generally horrors. The Wayans brothers just imitated the same exact jokes and didn't really add anything humorous at all and they also did a much worse job; so much to the effect that it wasn't funny anymore. If you like movies such as scary movie 4, meet the Spartans, epic movie, or date movie you MIGHT find this movie amusing, otherwise do not waste your time."
7530,"A potentially amusing segment, it proves to be in search of a comic sense it never arrives at and the examples taken from the book appear wholly unrealistic and not fully integrated. The second part is quite dark and brings forth a sort of investigation into the Sumo world and allegations of match - rigging. Some sections are more interesting than others. The rest of it is exposition about how all the super smart economists are using these fancy numbers and statistics to give very good proof that sumo wrestlers are cheating. The way the issues are presented usually involve first Levitt and Dubner speaking about the issue interspersed with various imagery and animation."
7396,"It turned out that "" Wishful Drinking "" was a nice show on a couple of different levels. And it was also a fun show, with a good amount of laughs and enjoyment. Watching "" Wishful Drinking "" does offer a good look into the real Carrie Fisher, especially if you haven't read her autobiographies beforehand. The 1 - 2 punch of Carrie Fisher's and Debbie Reynolds' deaths was a fitting, but tragic, end to a year unprecedented in the number of famous / recognizable people who passed on. filled with pictures and arrows of her parents, their spouses, their children, and her own two marriages and daughter, trying to find out if her daughter and another young man on the board could date, or were they, in fact, related?"
7529,"He's in his 80s and has lived something of monastic existence in the name of fashion - or as he might put it - the pursuit of beauty. The most fascinating is Editta Sherman, a 99 - year - old photographer who was once a muse for Andy Warhol. He's a chronic smiler and his sense of humor is refreshing in an industry known for pouty lips and raised eyebrows. He's one of the original street style photographers and his legacy is not only respected by those in the know, his influence ripples through the entire fashion industry. The music was so well grafted into the scenes that you may overlook it, but it guides the times and New York - living so well that it shouldn't be overlooked, either."
7527,"It also is such a breath of fresh air in an appalling year of C - grade superhero movies and obscure comic book adaptations. Hopefully this does well so Hollywood can go back to making well written thrillers and dramas like they used to. John Madden is no stranger to award winning dramas. Madden works the camera like a maestro in effortlessly weeding the story through multiple decades. Mirren may still get award recognition come December (the film is officially released December 29th), but it may be a long shot to see The Debt as one of the Best Picture nominees."
7228,"Other than being very lovely shoulders, she did an excellent job of portraying her character. She has a great range of endearing expressions. Finally, Oliver Platt added an enjoyable aside as Seyfried's boss. The cast is wonderful, with Seyfried and Egan making a talented and good - looking pair, and the lesser cast members doing nice work as well. The scenery, naturally, is dazzling and so are the costumes and cinematography."
7226,"The chemistry between O'Loughlin and Lopez is professional and solid, If nothing memorable. At her grandma's wedding Jlo's character is constantly using the cell phone. The whole premise was unrealistic that a great looking guy is going to stick around after finding out the woman he's dating is having twins. When she leaves the clinic very happy with the successful procedure, she meets the cheese manufacturer and college student Stan (Alex O'Loughlin) and they immediately feel attracted for each other. His decision of staying with an unstable woman pregnant of twins is absolutely unreasonable and never funny."
7225,Especially with the likes of the SAW films out there! The cast all do a fine job with their parts and the direction is very good. Yes the film has some brutal scenes but it's all part and parcel to draw you in.
7223,"They live in massive apartments, have high - paying careers, plenty of money and for everyone but Samantha, loving husbands and families. The funny thing about that is how they all have impossibly great lives, especially by NYC standards. THE GOOD: Yes, there were some funny moments, and some nice things to look at (clothes, design, men). Predictably, they get home and everyone is as introspective as they're capable of (not very much at all), and they realize how wonderful their lives really are (no they don't). The rest of the women's' problems' were no better."
7221,"What's most positive and enjoyable about the film is the desire of its characters to deal with their problems even when they're not aware they're doing it. But a natural striving to consciousness takes hold because they're all just open enough to admit they don't have all the answers. Although this is not one of the top echelon of movies, the compelling characters makes this better than most films you'll be able to find today. OK, that is a slight simplification, but it is an extremely well written story that showcases the imperfections of people, social situations and society as a whole. But that's where writer / director Nicole Holofcener gets it right â€” New York is full of life's ironic contradictions: Do good and bad in equal measure, feel bad about the bad, and go on living in one of the most glamorous cities ever crafted for the appetitive and the kind hearted."
7404,"Clocking in at a very economical 78 minutes Aleksey Fedorchenko's "" Silent Souls "" is a remarkable and remarkably beautiful Russian film dealing with both grief and identity but in a manner that is both uplifting and almost surrealistically comic. Little is actually said; these are indeed silent souls and what little story there is unfolds in almost totally visual terms and the cinematography of Mikhail Krichman is superb. There is a genuine purity about the feelings, some of which are extremely sexually explicit."
7219,"A fun night at the movies! Prince of Persia: the Sands of Time is supposed to be based on the video games of the early 2000s, and it does have some of the elements from the games: parkour, time - shifting elements, etc., but the film version of the PS2 classic is closer to an average sword and sandal adventure than the magical, sprawling world of the video game. The parkour is simple and practical instead of daring and dramatic like it is in the games. As a fun of the game; the script wasn't entirely accurate just like most of the movies based on games but it didn't stray too far either. This is Jake Gyllenhaal's most accessible film so far, and he goes to town with it."
7217,"It's not a comedy in the sense it's assembled out of jokes and humorous conflicts--Killers constructs its own parallel universe reality and giddily makes fun of it. Critically analyzing Killers is like reasoning with an alligator before it eats you alive; it's a waste of precious time better used for self reconcile. The couple gets married, move together and three years later (and half way through the film) his old boss calls him again,' you're ain't going out that easy' he promises, and he's right on the money. Kutcher is detail - oriented twitterer, and as an actor, his goofiness is unmatched. Him and Heigl have the best anti-chemistry, and casting them together was an unintentional stroke of genius; He's the Laurel to her Hardy."
7216,"Dean's philosophical outpourings may be interpreted by some as drivel, but more sensitive viewers will detect the shattering honesty. Writer / director Derek Cianfrance has crafted a brave and genuine relationship - character study. What's genius about Cianfrance's story is that the dialogue doesn't hold any type of pretense to it. Their performances here will be the kind that aspiring actors and theater students will learn from for years to come. Cianfrance wants to remind the audience that marriage is hard, it's a lot of work and it can get rocky, it's no laughing matter."
7215,"Great casting with superb performances from the central few characters and again a stunning turn from Ralph Fiennes. Poignant, touching, both gently and laugh out loud funny in places, a great character driven plot and just very very good film making IMO. Great use of music too, which like Tarantino movies always adds massively to the overall appeal. In other words, in his other works, Ricky's influences blend in with his originality and gave a unique product. They all want to take center stage (the main male, central characters), and this need for dominating the role really undermines the true talent that they posses."
7408,The sets and cinematography were spot on and very believable. All in all worth a go if you are in the mood for a few good laughs. Both Pegg and Serkis are OK in the lead roles and do their best to sound Irish. There are some genuine laughs to be had but usually when Pegg and Serkis are on the screen. Basically this is a reasonably graphic horror story with heart and morality that has some good laughs but falls flat in a few areas.
7214,"Von sydow is a pleasure to see as usual, and both Crowe and Cate Blanchett delivers. This movie had a lot of potential, but it's thrown away on hasted parts and plain stupid scenes."
7526,"Ostensibly the story of the main male character, a young - ish boy called Martin, the movie follows his travels with the enigmatic "" Mister "", who is an experienced vampire killer. The idea of a world with less human beings meddling with it always looks enticing. The acting was generally very good, the sets first class and the story went at a nice steady pace with just the right amount of horror thrown in to keep you on your toes. This movie owes more to the likes of "" The Road "" than it does Zombieland. Jim Mickle should be applauded for his direction; the film works very well as a whole, with good performances from the cast, a bleak soundtrack and pacing that could have easily been spoiled by trying to appeal to a bigger audience."
7212,"A great scene involved Pacino delving a subtle verbal blow to protesters outside his apartment building. What's interesting, though, is the focus on Pacino's eyes during the scene where he performs his first procedure. Considering Levinson directed excellent character - centric comedy / dramas like "" Good Morning Vietnam "" and "" Man of the Year "", the temptation must have been there. Danny Huston is fantastic as Geoffrey Fieger, Kevorkian's successful lawyer, and is equally as good interacting with Pacino as he is in the courtroom scenes. The story draws you in, the characters are well developed in all the right areas, and it doesn't take more than five minutes for Pacino to convince you he is Dr. Jack Kevorkian."
7209,"As a comedy it succeeded beyond expectations. Part of the pleasure surely came from the spectacle of the event; a sold out screening with cast and crew present along with regional cultural references that resonated infectiously with many in the audience, but this can take nothing away from the many levels of comedy at work within this film. There were elements of overacted screwball comedy; there were underplayed facial expressions and reactions that added a wealth of character and personality to the comedy; further still, there were elaborately constructed situational set pieces. The many characters were all utilised to give different points of views and different perspectives; the main protagonist Omar (Riz Ahmed) was fully fleshed out, with the other characters used to offer differing ideas and obviously the above mentioned comic relief. Four Lions is easily funny enough to reach a very wide audience, where viewers will be left without answers and therefore forced to discuss these issues, which are too often brushed under the proverbial rug."
7414,"Some may find it frustrating but it just added to CONFESSIONS's charm and wit. ' Confessions', like many fine traditional Japanese films, is very emotionally draining, but keeps up the suspense throughout the film. There are even some bloody scenes added to it, which make the movie more interesting. The black - grey - and - white setting, which is very different form the flamboyance of Memories of Matsuko, is stifling and depressing. Ms. Moriguchi is about to leave the school; but before that, she wants to impart one final lesson - on the value of life."
7208,"Everything about it is decent, but nothing great. The only people that could enjoy this film are todays generation of film goers who don't really have anything to call their own since this generation will be known as the generation of hacks and copycats."
7224,"Sean Combs delivers one of the funniest performances and Colm Meaney of "" Con Air "" isn't far behind him as Aldous' father Jonathan Snow. But if you've enjoyed other films like Sarah Marshal, Pineapple Express, and other Apatow troop films, you'll find Greek hilarious. If you love movies like Superbad and The Hangover, you will not be disappointed with this. Another standout is Sean Combs as an over-the-top music exec. a lot of the scenes from the trailers were not in the movie."
7525,"It's cool and funny for the insane character - Hesher. Perhaps your reviewer was confused because "" Hesher "" is really both funny and serious and a clever script nails it on both counts. "" Hesher "" IS very original and very funny. A wonderfully touching performance by an actor known mainly as a doofus on a TV show. Not so much in anger, but in freedom, and having fun at the expense of a few' versatile solutions for modern living'."
7206,"Gwyeneth Paltrow, as Pepper Potts, has a comes more to the forefront in the sequel. Samuel L. Jackson playing Nick Fury has a bigger role, and it leads all the viewers into wanting The Avengers movie to come out immediately. Scarlett Johansson also showed up with some impressive stunt work, along with her always gorgeous looks. The action scenes are all entertaining but they do not completely drive the movie. After the surprise success of Iron Man, expectations for the sequel, from both movie viewers and long time comic books fans, were no doubt high."
7205,"It's perfectly designed and pitched to be enjoyable on multiple levels: on one as an entertaining, illuminating mini-history of "" street art "" and on another - one entirely more convoluted and entertaining - as a light - hearted "" up yours "" to both street artists and their patrons. It's a hoax, it has to be, it's too hilariously perfect to be anything but. Banksy, as a street artist, has seen the perception of his works - by design temporary, and by design defacements - change from graffiti into art that needs preservation, that is cut out from walls and sold. Banksy, in making Exit Through the Gift Shop with Fairey and Guetta has found a way to deface, scrawl over and heap lighthearted disdain all over both himself and the people who snap up his art. Exit Through the Gift Shop captures the birth of a prank, an elaborate, entertaining gotcha that fits perfectly in Banksy's nose - tweaking, politically - aware, cheeky body of work."
7202,"In subject and style, it imports many of the characteristics of traditional mumblecore--offbeat humor, improvised feel, bare bones production values--wholesale. These are people who are trying their best to navigate tricky emotional terrain in the best way they know how, and the actors playing them all give lovely performances. The Duplass brothers, known for their quirky, loose film - making that includes restless shots and "" mumblecore "" style (the actors mostly improvise), have allowed these accomplished actors to express themselves in a realistic and charming way. The story's protagonist is John (John C. Reilly), a hang dog editor whose ex-wife is getting married and to whom Molly comes with the promise of a new life. While nothing unpredictable happens, and that is a flaw, the acting is first rate and the situations so believable (except for the oedipal hint) that this American comedy can be enjoyed for its European - style close - ups and lengthy scenes."
7201,"It's really those hacks like Johnny Depp and Meryl Streep who are destroying everything classic cinema stood for. Now there are those jealous haters out there, determined to bring her acting career down. The book was amazing: funny, romantic, sad, cheerful, pretty much everything you could want in a book. Well, everything that made the book great was taken out in this appallingly horrible movie. The plot lines showed major attention to detail, and the twists and turns that this writer takes you on are so convincing."
7200,"The Losers can definitely be a contender against The A-Team. The characters are original and the guy with the glasses needs to be in more movies. The Losers frequently plays all this for laughs, it has a great sense of humour without which the film would be epically cheesy. So for an early blockbuster, The Losers delivers about what you'd expect. He loves knives as you will see in the movie and has a bit of a weird side to him."
7522,"Ricardo Darin (from the "" Son of the Bride "" and the Oscar winner "" The Secret in her eyes "") as the repented lawyer and Martina Guzman (the director's wife and a real revelation) as a drug addicted doctor give outstanding performances, but the supporting cast quite as good. In brief; perhaps a little more work on the history could improve this movie but is still far better and effective than 98% of movies currently in theaters. They are so human and common that they can do the movie perfectly credible, 'cause, everything (except the love history) is a every day real situations. Of course is not everything tetricus and bad, is a part, there is also good and nice places, but this movie is focused on the dark side. Trapero is a top - notch scriptwriter and director."
7298,"There's no doubt about it that Flipped will make you say "" aww "" on occasion, but there's a lot more to it than just kids being cute. Juli herself flips for Bryce Loski, who is at first repelled by Juli and then slowly starts to see her for the lovely person she is. For those who are bored by the dumb - dumb summer comedies of 2010 ("" The Other Guys, "" "" Dinner for Schmucks "") and the special - effects hijinks of "" Inception, "" this is a tender and emotionally satisfying journey that will stay with you for years. In a year of formulaic, mind - numbing flicks with no imagination or heart like Letters to Juliet, Flipped is a welcome breath of fresh air. Humor, issues of class, family conflict, and the lost idealism of youth are introduced into the story by Bryce and Juli's respective families, and there are several outright bittersweet or poignant scenes within the story."
7196,"Some really fantastic performances from these child actors and a storyline everyone can relate to. Chloe Moretz and Steve Zahn round out the cast that shows the ups and downs of a boy and his best friend as they journey into middle school for the first time. The two are believable as best friends forever in Harry Potter - Ron Weasley proportions, and it is their play against each other, one using the other to further his cause, the other just happy to have someone whom he can try to emulate, being the strong points in the narrative. Their acting's natural, and have incredible chemistry so much so that you wonder if everything will go downhill when they split. The main character of the movie, Greg Heffley (played wonderfully by Zachary Gordon) stayed true to the book and he was totally believable."
7427,"The context and hypotheses given by the interviewees only helps to deepen the sense of wonder as each section of the cave is discussed in turn by everyone from the chief scientist to art historians, to a master perfumer, and in typical Herzog fashion, many of them are quite eccentric and add some humorous touches along the way. Nothing about what may have inspired the prehistoric artists, what his or her motives may have been, or what techniques they may have used, are present in the film. It contains perhaps the most extraordinary array of cave paintings dated from between 23, 000 to 30, 000 years ago as well as extraordinary calcite formations, stalagmites / stalactites and ancient bones of creatures long migrated from the continent. A lot of the shots are lit solely by a moving torch light and the constant re-focusing of your eyes only strains them further. There are a couple of hilarious exchanges where Werner has typically cut someone off too early or left them hanging when they have finished."
7194,"Martin Lawrence, Danny Glover, Tracey Morgan, Zoe Saldana, Peter Dinklage, Luke Wilson, and others comprise an undeniably talented cast that does an admirable job performing characters that were written as upper - crust Englishmen, but watching Rock sulk his way through the film makes it abundantly clear that they're not being themselves. Despite all this many of the best moments of the original are copied perfectly and work just as well as they did the first time around meaning that there are several good laughs to be had, but when you've got the choice of watching this or the original there's really no contest. LaBute and star Chris Rock, who also served as a producer on the film, cheekily' adapt' U. K. writer Dean Craig's screenplay by peppering it with hip - pop pop - culture nods to Usher and R. Kelly, and leaving the rest, in essence, unchanged. Who make the same movie 3 yrs later man, seriously! ' Unnecessary' is probably the best single word description of Neil LaBute's "" Death at a Funeral . """
7193,"This is an entertaining film version of The Runaways story. "" The Runaways "" makes clear that these teenage girls fought. Joan Jett declined to participate in "" Edgeplay, "" despite the fact she is portrayed in a mostly positive light as perhaps the most ambitious, talented and level - headed member of the band. She and Jett essentially started the band, as shown in "" The Runaways . "" She's also the most entertaining interviewee in "" Edgeplay . """
7430,"Liv Tyler drifts sweetly and innocently into the backdrop of Frank's crusade as his angelic wife Sarah, but the show - stealing Ellen Page dives straight in front as the sadistically adorable Libby, later becoming Darbo's sidekick Boltie. But during a chance epiphany, he realizes his true calling is to be a superhero â€“ the Crimson Bolt â€“ and fight against those committing any sort of crime, whether it be drug dealing, underage rape or even butting in - line at the movies. Smaller turns by Gregg Henry, Michael Rooker and especially Nathan Fillion all pay off wonderfully within the film. His greatest moments in life is marrying a recovering drug addict, Sarah (Liv Tyler) and helping a cop catch a purse snatcher. Rainn Wilson's astounding central performance as mopey Frank and his demented alter - ego frantically shakes the viewer throughout, tearing the words directly from the page with emotional and personal flair, allowing him to be both despondently bitter and broken, as well as painfully hilarious at exactly the same time."
7191,"For the Fosters Phil (Steve Carell) and Claire (Tina Fey), such is their married life, with spontaneity and energy being sucked so dry, even their regular date nights seem like a chore. And yet, he (or just the studio) must have had the insight to put together two of the funniest people working right now - not to mention with shows back - to - back on Thursday nights on NBC - Steve Carrel and Tina Fey, because they help elevate anyone's work by a longshot. And when they come across some other supporting characters, like Mark Wahlberg's (VERY) shirtless ex-military guy with all of his high - tech equipment, or the "" real "" Tripplehorns played by James Franco and Mila Kunis, there's further hilarity that ensues from the interactions and precise timing. The reason this film works is not the plot or script, but rather the talents of the two funniest people in showbiz today: Steve Carell and Tina Fey. Starring two of the funniest people in the American film industry makes this a must - see."
7189,"Great Soundtrack, great fight scenes, acting was good, story was great and original. Although deserving it's 18A R rating, this movie will blow your mind with awesomeness, yes thats right AWESOMENESS. His friends, also comedic, also will remind any guy of their own little group of three musketeers talking about movies, sports, comics and of coarse girls. Despite all the blood and violence there are some touching moments in this film. An explosive ride that covers insane action sequences, intelligent superhero parodies and intense dramatic turns, Kick - Ass is a welcome addition to the realm of the comic - book movie."
7187,"Mads Mikkelsen, who was a memorable villain in Casino Royale, actually gets to play a fairly decent good guy in this film (Draco). Gemma Arterton (as Io), however, proves to be the most successful female character in the movie. The fight with her proved to be the most interesting of the many fights in the film. Like the original, the other Gods do not have much to do. Perseus then meets Zeus who suddenly seems pleased with his son though Mankind still hates the gods."
7520,"Like the best historical dramas, Redford never comes out and says if he believes that Surrat was innocent or guilty. Phenomenal casting is just one the great aspects of "" The Conspirator "". As far as performances go, James McAvoy and Robin Wright were outstanding. Robin Wright and James McAvoy do an amazing job in portraying real, complicated human beings. The cast is riveting, with breathtakingly well - done small and large parts."
7184,"First, the 3D (Odeon digital in this screening) is moving more toward the subtle with fewer "" gratuitous "" 3D moments than in movies like Bolt and Coraline. And although it's very funny, this really isn't just an accumulation of gags and one - liners loosely held together by a paper - thin story: this is a great adventure and touching coming - of - age tale where the protagonist has an actual arc; it tells an intelligent and compelling story about people who are not just one - note characters, and they're wonderfully realized through the great voice - work of such actors as Jay Baruchel, America Ferrera, Gerard Butler and Craig Ferguson. HTTYD is the latest in a run of animated 3D films to hit the family market. Thank goodness that this film, directed by Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, avoids this like the plague, and Jay Baruchel voices Hiccup, a viking kid who happens to be more brains than brawn, more scrawny than buffed, and this of course sets him apart from the rest of his warrior clan folks, who are battle scarred from the constant defense of the village pests - dragons who come from afar to plunder their livestock and setting their houses on fire, so much so that every house on the block is relatively brand new. This is a huge accomplishment for DreamWorks Animation, it might actually be its Best Animated Feauture it yet."
7182,"Nor is a timeless comedy masterpiece like "" Airplane "", "" Blazing Saddles "", or "" Monty Python and the Holy Grail "". In the year 2010, Adam (John Cusack), Nick (Craig Robinson) and Lou (Rob Corddry) are three best friends living in Los Angeles, who have drifted apart from one another during the course of their lives. All four of the male leads are brilliant, especially Corddry, who pulls off one of the great movie arseholes, without completely detaching himself from the audience. John Cusack played the' serious' dramatic / comedic role and Clark Duke has his moments while helping to aim the whole package toward a younger demographic. John Cusack and Craig Robinson also had very hilarious moments in this film."
7437,"One of those inspirational films that stays in your head after you see it, leaves an impact, and then leaves an even bigger impact when you remember that everything you saw really did happen. This brings back memory s of late night highlight shows of a race that happened hours before. Seventeen years after the passing of one of the greatest Formula 1 racing drivers of all time a documentary has been released that examines his ten - year career in the sport. By allowing the voice - over of the various people associated with Senna (most notable this consists of McLaren's team principal Ron Dennis, his mother, father and sister, F1 team Doctor Sid Watkins, and Brazilian commentator Reginaldo Leme) to supplement the footage, it both preserves he power of the on - screen image and provides the audience with additional information regarding the situation or event that is being presented."
7177,"the story was good with great action scenes and at times just plain brutal. The reference is just thrown in there to sound smart, to seem thoughtful, when the film is anything but. Remy (Jude Law, CLOSER) and Jake (Forest Whitaker, WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE) are two of these Repo Men and they're very good at their jobs. He enjoys his job so much that he's willing to do anything to anyone in order to ensure he and Remy can keep working together. The action scenes are quite good, and while the overbearing presence of music makes some of it feel like a weird music video, it's nonetheless well - choreographed fighting and slashing."
7439,"To save Dalton, Josh and Renai call on a ghost - hunting team (Leigh Whannell, Angus Sampson) and a psychic (Lin Shaye) to investigate the paranormal presence within the house and put a stop to it before their son's soul is lost to "" the further . "" Josh (Wilson) and Renai (Byrne) think they have it all: a beautiful new home, three lovely children .Â .Â . and a gang of unruly ghosts causing torment around them. James Wan, best known as one of the initial creators of the' Saw' series, returns to the duo with' Saw' co-creator Leigh Whannel (who also stars) with a new ghost story starring Patrick Wilson (' Watchmen') and Rose Byrne (' Get Him to the Greek'). So, if you plan on seeing this movie, please consider this a cautionary reminder: it's probably best to go with someone who's already witnessed you have a complete physical and mental breakdown, so as to avoid an embarrassing drive home. Technically, the film is quite impressive, especially for the reported $1 million budget, which is unsurprising after what Wan & Whannell did with the $1."
7173,"Gerard is his own charming persona and Aniston is, well, Rachel from Friends, though they exhibit some chemistry. It has some fun moments, though familiar, and it will not seem a total waste of time. Everyone associated with this film except the talented Christine Baranski as Nicole's cabaret - singing, swinging mother should be locked up. All of the cute stuff (and pretty much the only cute stuff) was contained in those previews. Jennifer Aniston did a decent job, given what she had to work with (though she does act like she does in most of her other movies)."
7172,"The young leads are a charming, believable couple, and you do root for them. Some scenes work better than others. The best parts of the movie were the story with Forest Whitaker and Regina King, and anything with Charlie Murphy, who has a small but hilarious role. Much like those fun little videos you made back in high school, you aren't going to get it unless you where there. Forest Whittaker and Carlos Mencia play the fathers of young lovers Marcus and Lucia (Lance Gross and America Ferrera) who return home to L. A. to announce their surprise engagement and plans to be married immediately."
7442,"In fact, within the first five minutes, there were more laughs than some comedy movies manage to achieve in their entirety. The movie' Boy' is proof that a good script, decent characters and plenty of laughs produces a better result than big budget movies with no originality and plenty of marketing. Go and see this--but only if you like decent movies, 1980 references, laughing and characters you'll care about; a blend of serious under - currents wrapped up in quirky NZ humor. Boy is a simple but emotionally powerful story about growing up, relationships, following your head over your heart and drawing the line between right and wrong. It's Rich characters and humorous dialogue, entailed by the occasional light - hearted hand drawn animations delivered a hugely entertaining blend of culture, comedy and drama."
7169,"Right when you think you have come to accept the history and world around you, this movie reawakens your emotions and makes you feel things that you thoulght you'd come to terms with. A movie can be judged by its separate parts, and most of the time it is, but one must also consider the glue that holds the separate parts together. The movie gets a bit slow at times, especially for fans of Twilight movies, but if you are patient, and pay attention to the characters they will draw you in and time will fly."
7444,"The chemistry between Reeves and his counterparts (Vera Farmiga and James Caan) was really good and palpable. Vera Farmiga, who plays the female lead character, is superb, credible and bitter enough to give convincing diva acting in the Checov's Cherry orchard play, which is crucial for the dynamic development of the movie itself. It features comic elements and there are points when you chuckle, but it isn't a comedy (possibly more of a comedy of errors than an outright comedy). James Caan is clearly having a great deal of fun as Max, and Vera Farmiga continues to impress by cutting a thoroughly believable Julie out of unlikely cloth. The acting is superb, starting with a sentimental Keanu Reeves, continuing with an excellent performance by Vera Farmiga, and ending with the always credible James Caan."
7167,"There are some funny moments here. Their scenes with Kirk are enjoyably like a crude, vulgar, sexual "" Breakfast Club "". The way the scrawny, nervous, and unconfident Baruchel interacts with the beautiful and engaging Eve is also very likable and they do a nice job of handling the ups and downs of forming an honest, meaningful relationship (an almost foreign concept in today's star - packaged romantic comedies). Something hilarious would happen, and then you'll spend the next five minutes wondering whether what you're seeing is supposed to be funny or not. It was quite funny in parts, and even the most generic parts of it weren't bad - just overly familiar."
7446,"In 1844, the peace of the Feudal Japan is threatened by the cruel Lord Naritsugu Matsudaira (GorÃ´ Inagaki) that is politically rising and getting closer to his half - brother, the shogun. But the cunning samurai Hanbei Kitou (Masachika Ichimura) that is responsible for the security of his master foresees Shinza's intent. An epic Jidaigeki homaging Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, the film follows veteran warrior Shinzaemon Shimada, entrusted with the task of eliminating a bloodthirsty powerful nobleman, untouchable by the law; Shimada assembles a team of fighters for the dangerous mission. KÃ´ji Yakusho is excellent as Shimada, but only three or four of his men - including his nephew and a clownish bandit who is a clear homage to Seven Samurai's Kikuchiyo - get any kind of development; the rest are simply guys with swords."
7165,"Ben Stiller, in a terrific performance, is the titular ne'er do well, an itinerant carpenter housesitting for his brother in Los Angeles for six weeks. It moves slowly and demands extra attention, but even if you're really into the story you might wonder where those 107 minutes went. She goes on one - night stands because they feel good - okay, no problem there - but she has few true connections in life. Whilst there are some things going for it, mostly in performances, including a good supporting role from Rhys Ifans, there is very little going for it, especially when it runs at nearly 2 hrs, it's a tough film experience. Stealing his limelight is Greta Gerwig as Florence who gives a fine performance here."
7518,"They kept most of the aliens, but changed a lot to the series which is pretty refreshing after it had been out for five years. The Character designs are great and the development is wonderful. Gantz really did a decent job with following both the Manga and the Anime. The anime had 2 full seasons to tell the story, the movie had just two hours. They are given suitcases with black suits and cool sci - fi guns."
7163,"And everything in this is nothing you haven't seen before with the explosions and gun fights and all, but something about the film just makes it pretty damn entertaining. Outrageous action and explosions, plenty of violence (most of it unexpected) - with a very high body count, this is the type of Film that Luc Besson does very well. Great locations and Cinematography, and very important for Films of the genre - It's fast moving and never boring. But the fast talking Travolta was entertaining and was very complimentary with his co-stars Chemistry and pace: The characters were good with each other. A young spy who wants to get bigger and better jobs is partnered with an American hot head with a foul mouth and a love for violence."
7162,"It's a fast paced and riveting ride from the get - go. The premise set up in the film regarding the' Intelligence' regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction used to justify the invasion is entirely believable. Matt Damon is well suited to his part as a unit leader Roy Miller, as is Brendan Gleeson as the CIA man and Greg Kinnear is refreshingly nasty as Poundstone from the Pentagon - all turn in good performances. This was something that you rarely see in movies like this, and made the movie the enjoyable experience that it is. Standing in his way are the remaining loyal insurgents, a Whitehouse bureaucrat named Poundstone (Greg Kinnear) who wants to keep things on track and his asset on the ground who is tasked with stopping Miller's inquiries."
7161,"The cast acquit themselves well, especially considering the noted difficulty in emoting to a tennis ball on a stick, but all their tics and quirks seem to be masking a void at the centre of what should be a free - floating, evocative trip. With a source material so familiar, even to those whose knowledge is second hand references, there needs to be a degree of innovation (as in Svenkmejer's dark stop - motion version, or the co-opting of Terry Gilliam in to his "" Tideland "" narrative), or else a studious and inspired adaptation that completely returns to Lewis Carroll."
7160,"But there exist some people who are gifted (or cursed; depends on your point of view) to see things as they are without their interests hindering the view of their souls. All these antonyms intelligently swap places through the story of innocent civilians accused for no fault of their own post the 9/11 attacks. The way he goes to an only Christian event and donates the money and says "" Take this money for the Africans who are not Christians, darling "" is awesome. The film is traditionally a love story more than anything else, but the ever relevant message behind it is wonderfully conveyed through such terms as innocence and guilt, kindness and inhumanity, truth and untruth, justice and injustice, love and hate. The movie will become a cult classic for SRK fans and even those who hate SRK."
7453,"Louis C. K.'s latest comedy concert film is Hilarious, the first ever stand - up documentary to be accepted at Sundance. The film is economically produced--C. K. does his own direction and editing--and spends much of its time in a mid shot of C. K.'s face; content is everything here. Whatever its personal implications, C. K.'s recent divorce is a great development for his comedy: it allows him to take his trademark pessimism on dates, to the gym, and even to the club. He pares incredulous contempt for beautiful people with his own healthy self - loathing--but because this is Louis C. K, he absolutely never pities himself. Much of his best and most human material is derived from life as a father; he invokes his daughters with a disarming love and respect, while realistically explicating the more disgusting elements of parenthood."
7157,"There's a fair amount of whimsy and reality which makes it great for children and adults who are children at heart, the little cameo by Seth Macfarlane doesn't hurt either. As a result, he is summoned to Fairyland, and sentenced by head fairy Lily (Julie Andrews) to two weeks' duty as a Tooth Fairy, a real - deal winged creeper with a bat - belt full of spy gadgets and a lanky, awkward case worker with fairy aspirations of his own (Stephen Merchant, co-creator with Ricky Gervais of The Office). He's a cartoon pragmatist, dispensing hard truths about the impossibility of dreams coming true to young hockey players wanting to be just like him."
7156,"Basically, if zombie movies in general are your bag, you should love The Crazies. It's one of those rare moments of credibility â€“ and good casting - where the chemistry between two principals is so strong, you actually believe they could be married in real life and because of this, you're rooting for them every step of the way while everything around them is going to hell. One point of differentiation between this movie and other "" zombie "" movies is that the creatures do not seek to eat the flesh of the humans (thereby reducing the gore factor but there is still plenty of scene that are unsettling) and retain a sense of their actions (allowing them to seek revenge and work in teams). The Crazies is effectively scary, mixing human emotions with raw blood and gore and endless edge - of - your seat thrills. Director Breck Eisner's Crazies is moody and smart with a great sense of humour about it."
7151,"For some reason many action stars have supplemented their income by appearing in movies with kids. After a variety of PG style mishaps Bob captures the bad guys and wins the day, the girl friend and the family. The action is lighter than most Chan movies but it is inventive and fun. his films have always entertained, hell ya, he was entertaining even if the material wasn't. Valetta doesn't get much to do other than play the usual girlfriend / divorcÃ©e / mom of three but she holds her own."
7150,"Accompanied by a poetic score by the always reliable Alexandre Desplat the film suggests a constant looming menace, embodied by the rain of the New England island. Lovely performances by Olivia Williams, who is sexy and vulnerable, Pierce Brosnan, the absolutely always brilliant Tom Wilkinson and an extraordinary cameo by Actors Studio legend Eli Wallach (he still has the chops!) The ending caps a perfect film perfectly, and the MacGuffin is great fun. Collaborating with author Robert Harris from his novel "" The Ghost "" (film title expanded, no doubt, to avoid misleading Polanski fans who would assume a return to the supernatural) Polanski has fashioned a real nail - biter that, thanks to the solid performances and deft plotting, plays extremely well whether you like politics or know much about foreign policy. Polanski channels Hitchcock at his best, using Desplat's driving score (himself channeling Herrman), and just when it all could have been a tribute, it soars above its inspiration."
7149,"What he may lack in compelling direction skills, he more than makes up for in witty screenplays with equal balance raunch and insight having crafted classics such as Clerks and Chasing Amy. They are not meant to make a huge impact on you, just give you some good laughs for an hour and a half or so. The camera is always moving in circles, there's one or two moments where the directed object is out of focus, and it's especially shaky in the action scenes."
7459,"It was eagerly awaited for years, the trailer which was the whole film in fast motion looked ravishing, and it seemed as if in this, perhaps his last film, Godard would deliver his final testament, a summation of all the themes which have run through his work for the last fifty years. In its high def cinematography the colours are gorgeous, the Mediterranean setting recalling that of Le MÃ©pris, but whereas the latter film was a profound meditation on European culture and civilisation, here the characters spout banal platitudes about politics or philosophy as the ship sails along past various cities; in the Spanish section there is a scene of a bullfight, in the Italian section a clip from a Rossellini film, it's that predictable. Jean - Luc Godard is a reference in cinema and changed the art fifty years ago with a unique challenging style that defied current esthetics and etiquette."
7148,"understandable, they are 1, 000 pages each. The premise of this movie - that Greek gods were real and have offspring in the modern world - is interesting. Several big stars feature in cameo roles and for anyone who knows a fair bit about who celebrities are, this tends to distract from the movie. It could have benefited from having the minor roles played by less known actors - as it is, their appearances tend to detract from the main characters who actually do a good job with the material they have been given. He had some REAL background and was a much more interesting character, although, Jake Abel plays his part reasonably well considering he doesn't really have ANY reason to hate the gods."
7144,"The movie is based on a book by Dennis Lehane and is packed with twists and turns that will leave you breathless and uneasy. The film uses everything at its disposal from breathtaking scenery, to detailed laid - out shots, and to actors at their finest to completely engross you in the film. There are some flashbacks in the movie, but all of them are important clues to DiCaprio's character. It is perhaps the best movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio. As with Scorsese and DiCaprio's previous collaborations, this is a movie that must be seen."
7461,"Incendies provides so many reasons why people should actually get to see those nominees at all costs. Suffice to say that even if you have no interest in the history of the Middle East, this film will capture your attention from the start and grips you right till the end. Hopefully, Incendies will be remembered for years to come as the little, brilliant film that spawned the great fame of Denis Villeneuve. Like an intense personal experience, it takes a lot to come to grips with the film's story, a moving plot full of twists and catharsis. This exceptional Canadan film should easily win best Foreign film at the Oscars."
7143,"There are many suspenseful moments and the movie makers seem to have a clear grasp of what the objective was. In contrast to the belief and the whine of many critics, there is an audience out there for dark, gritty and atmospheric werewolf movies such as' The Wolfman'. Joe Johnston has done his job very well - the movie was emotional at moments, and gory and scary, when needed. They don't technically give "" Oscar Worthy performances "", but their acting certainly is very believable. The good jump scenes are something one could see very rare in such a good quality."
7142,"The two Taylor's, Lautner and Swift, play their love - struck high school couple with a cheerful amount of tongue - in - cheek; Kutcher proves his charisma can go a long way as a heartbroken florist; and Cooper and Roberts (Julia, that is) are intriguing as plane passengers who don't know each other. That way, if one story doesn't work, you have multiple other chances to still enjoy the movie. That's about all she got to see, her favorite stars on screen. It takes more than just a bunch of big stars to propel a rom - com to quality heights; you need strong writing, good chemistry, strong direction, and a hintage of unpredictability. One other note: Ashton Kutcher, Topher Grace, and Bradley Cooper are three men that given the little time in this movie delivered swell performances that was undermined only by the writing."
7138,"Like anything, autism has positive and negative effects, as this film makes plain in its well - rounded examination of this real individual's life. Despite a childhood filled with bullying and derision from others (subtly sketched in the movie), Temple is focused, confident, driven, and gutsy. Her interest in science and her ability to conceptualize were nurtured by a caring science teacher, wonderfully played in a subtle performance by the always capable David Straithairn. Claire Danes absolutely nailed this performance. Finally someone has captured what it is really like, living on the Autistic Spectrum."
7510,"Any classic and really known horror movie is in Dylan Dog comics - Living Dead (saga), Shining, Terminator, vampires, werewolves,. While they show pictures of people in Groucho glasses and posters for Marx Brothers movies, the cost for securing the rights to have an imitator was likely quite high. The movie character shared much in common with the comics character: mistrust of technology (the comics Dylan refuses to use a cell phone, the movie Dylan still uses cameras with film in them); a deep, brooding disinterest in the world at large; drives the same VW Bug, even though the colors have been inverted; and, though some may disagree, he even looks a lot like the Dylan from the comics. A pact was formed, presumably to protect the "" monsters "" from being wiped out entirely by humanity, and as part of that pact, a human was chosen to sort of police the undead; to keep them in check, so to speak. The thrill factor of course is the make up and effects in having the monsters look their nasty part, although they aren't something that hasn't been seen before on screen."
7134,"It's actually a very involved thriller that has a fair few twists and turns around a conspiracy Gibson's daughter was involved in. The pacing is pretty quick in some places, so it keeps you interested. He went behind the camera for the graphic Passion of the Christ and the beautiful Apocalypto. There are a few scenes that you'll have to suspend reality for, like when someone gets hit by a car at the right place at the right time. Some fine performances by supporting actors add to the quality of the film."
7133,"A definite date movie, movie buffs may want to take a pass on this for the time being, particularly with the multitude of Oscar - Bait movies making their way to to screen. Following the trend, 2010's first romantic comedy' When In Rome' hopes to achieve the same success with similar tactics. Years of waiting for the perfect romance has made Beth bitter. But if you already know you're a sucker for romantic comedies (particularly heavily humor - laden ones, whether brilliant humor or otherwise), you will probably enjoy yourself. Wow, what ever happen to the good romantic comedies?"
7129,"If, however, you like movies because the actors telling the story makes a fantasy feel so real you actually feel you're gonna break the armrests off your chair you should do yourself a favor and see this movie. First off, Jude Law and Paul Bettany must share a personal trainer because Mr Bettany is as ripped in this as Jude is in Repomen. All in all, Legion is hugely entertaining, some scenes having serious WTF? moments and the end leaves it nicely open for a sequel. Angel Michael disobeys God's orders of termination and decides to aid a barricaded group of humans at a lone desert diner."
7469,"Excellent casting, pretty good story with some slick action scenes make this movie really worth seeing, there is something for guys and girls. Now, the end was amazing, but without the hour and a half of plot, story, characters, suspense, good fight / action scenes, sweet revenge, etc. the end would not have been so incredible. You may want to compare this with, or see shades of the film from the likes of Luc Besson's The Professional, Pierre Morel's Taken and Tony Scott's Man on Fire, with the common running theme of a highly skilled operative taking it upon himself to rescue someone they love from the clutches of devious villains, and executing a brand of vengeance without remorse as he ploughs through and single - handedly demolishes all who stand in his way. Those scenes alone will be reason enough to watch this for a second time, and for fans of the revenge thriller flicks, The Man From Nowhere sets to deliver the no BS, dead serious treatment that will leave you applauding each time any bad guy bites the dust. The stylish BOURNE looking action scenes specially needs to be appreciated."
7112,"Yes all the survivors are short on t - shirts, but live in a wealth of leather and goggles. Even amidst such despair, one can rise and accomplish anything. The other aspects lending to the power of The Book of Eli are its technical aspects. Moody slo - mo shots abound with wonderfully toned colors. The soundtrack adds immensely to this feeling, using soft ambient chords and blasting action - scene drums when necessary."
7111,"Both leads were outstanding in this film. For laughs, there are pratfalls and other silliness (that's a good thing). It is rooted, it is humanistic, and it is earnestly funny in spots. She (played by Amy Adams) is an American career woman who has responded to her father's (played by John Lithgow) financial misadventures by forging a life of success and security. Some romantic comedies are more comedy than romance, or more romance than comedy, but this one blends the two into something especially delightful."
7845,"Andy is in love and engaged to Lauren Baker (Krysten Ritter) for one year but he is unable to satisfy Lauren in bed. In Los Angeles, the clumsy Andy Conners (Josh Meyers) works at the Fearless Records selecting new talents. Nevertheless Krysten Ritter is hot and sexy and makes the film work reasonably. Most comedies open with something funny. The best part was the somewhat clever opening credits score."
7871,"On the Less Positive side: this comfort seemed to mean that neither the director or the actors felt the need to push for strong performances. For 20 years Law & Order found a way to float the camera and bring some visual energy to a dialog - heavy scene, and audiences have come to like / want that. There were no technical notes given, but assuming it was shot with a Red, the DP did a credible job, especially given that he had 8 days to shoot everything. Both leads (and Mr Pevsner) had nice bodies and nice butts. It could have been 15 minutes shorter, and have moved faster throughout."
8011,"Compared to the previous "" Justice League: The New Frontier "", Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths benefits from a more action driven storyline and mature writing that hearkens back to the style of the award winning Justice League animated TV series. Where New Frontier felt a bit squeezed and underdeveloped, Crisis on two earths gets the story pacing just right allowing for a fair mix of subtle character drama and high flying superhero smash - ups. Dwayne McDuffie manages to craft a story that stands out on its own while carrying all the elements of what made the DCAU. Most DC animation fans would have heard the rumor that this movie was supposed to be set in the same time - line as the DCAU Justice League and justice league unlimited series. It might take a while to warm up to the new voices for Superman, Batman and the rest but once past that, you'll realize that the cast does a wonderful job of fleshing out their characters to be both familiar yet fresh."
8035,"The acting was good and was a massive strength of the movie and Queen Latifah and Common stand out from the entire cast with their marvellous performances as their characters. Just Wright really should have sunk with the very predictable story and the romantic - comedy clichÃ©s but writer Michael Elliot and director Sanaa Hamri have made it work and have both done a great job on this movie, you can tell the attention has been put into it. She is everything a Woman should be in this world, and she pulled it off with conviction and believability. With charming performances and a good story along with it, this beats quite a few movies in its genre. It's very predictable and you'll more than likely guess everything within the first minute of the movie but it's such a charming movie and the story is a good story to follow."
7477,"Along with being very funny, It genuinely understands and insightfully explores, teen anxiety and communication / perception troubles. The film also shows the tremendous versatility and courage of filmmaker Richard Ayoade. ' Submarine' has created its own category, as it's quite different from Ayoade's brilliant TV comedies, It has a very unique, personal language and sensibility, which is equally thrilling and satisfying for the viewers. Writer - Director Richard Ayoade does a great job of keeping the pace moving with no wasted moments & a dialogue that is both witty & believable at the same time. The ups and downs of this British comedy are mainly due to Ayoade's wonderful screenplay and direction that are touching yet never slip into sentimentality - he often playfully pokes fun at it in many cases â€“ but what also deserves credit are the poignant score by Arctic Monkey's singer Alex Turner, the cinematography that effortlessly shifts between comic framing and beautiful imagery and the note - perfect performances by the entire cast."
7478,""" Everything Must Go "" is a wonderful film. The actors also do a great job with the pauses; everything about this movie makes it fresh. It also has very funny moments; although not the laugh out loud kind of humor, but more of a put a grind on your face kind of comedy. And for a movie to bring these truths to light in such an artistic, engaging and REAL fashion. Everything Must Go is a good film in general, but a great film in terms of Ferrell, who is essentially putting on a one - man - show for more than half the film."
7479,"For a film with such a haunting and depressing scenario,' Beginners' is a surprisingly powerful and perceptive piece of cinema. Beginners' blends comedy and romance against a dramatic backdrop in order to create a charming and character - driven story. ' Beginners' is a powerfully understated piece of independent filmmaking that maintains it's emotional resonance from start to finish. Mills direction includes experimental artistic elements into the narrative which many times are very engaging but a few times are a bit baffling; nevertheless, kudos to Mills for thinking outside the "" beginners "" box. "" Beginners "" stars Ewan McGregor as Oliver Fields, an artist who shies away from romantic relationships until he begins to romance the free - spirit French actress Anna."
8067,"You really have to thank the creators for their great vision, Vash the Stampede's character is pure genius, he's the hero that everybody loves and respects, and you'll find this apparent in both the TV series and movie. Trigun Badlands Rumble is a very good movie, with some nice nostalgia for Trigun fans. Trigun: Badlands Rumble is * beep * awesome and feels a lot like one of those episodes that never made it into the show, based on the story and feeling. Visually speaking, this is the best that Vash and his friends have ever looked onscreen. Vash the Stampede, a gunfighter with a giant bounty on his head, always wearing his favorite red - colored trench coat, is back."
8104,"There was so much amazing about this movie but when you add overly long scenes of someone annoyingly breathing super close into a mic and a camera shaking and running so much you cant even see what's going on it absolutely kills anything good and creepy about the movie. NOTHING happens for well over 2 mins, yet this is one of the most unnerving scenes in the whole movie! It was scary but doesn't have a lot of nonstop jolts like the Paranormal Activity series but the intensity is their and the fear of the unknown and the big reveal at the end was clever and shocking and gave it an even more sinister tone that will get under your skin but still expected something bigger and different but liked the direction it took which was a different change of pace. They tried to make it believable by adding twice the shake (and zoom) as in the usual found footage movies. To the movies credit, if they cut those horribly boring long scenes this would have been a great movie."
7483,"Within a few minutes, Sebastian Gutierrez appeared on stage doing a one man show entertaining the audience to the highest level possible. A lot of laughs and some dramedy filled moments ensue. "" Elektra Luxx "" has a cast of some of the most beautiful women in showbiz and surprisingly all of them are great actresses as well. Carla Gugino's lead role as Elektra is not only fun but a very good performance. Her character isn't as simple as you may think and Gugino plays the role with such passion that you just enjoy every moment she is on screen."
7683,"Right from the opening credits, the music and visuals seem to surround you in acidic euphoria. This is a contemporary film noir with scientific and abstract overtones. If, during moments when you have no idea what could possibly be coming next, you delight in that fact, finding them beyond delicious, then this movie is for you. This is classic detective story with very modern elements like atomic fusion and a sexual charge uncommon 40 years ago. The technical aspects; particularly cinematography are excellent also."
7253,"The 2 main female characters are lovely and appealing personalities. Some interesting character twists with the oily young rock - star magician helping Molina, and some very funny cheeky nods to the original animated Fanatasia - watch for the nod to Star Wars. THE SORCEROR'S APPRENTICE is fun, and at a time where movies like these fail to deliver such simple mercies, it's a pleasant little surprise. After the general Festival opening announcements, Jay Baruchel (who was in attendance) introduced the film to the happy hometown audience. And Baruchel proved to be well cast as the nerdy, endearing, reluctant hero / apprentice."
7252,The cinematography is beautiful in this film and the acting is well done by the four principles. This is a ninety minute movie that should take you 30 minutes to watch. They are many better crafted and acted movies surrounding this theme available before you get to this point. *** SPOILERS ** It later becomes apparent that this ghost wolf is not real but a figment of Noelle's imagination in her being the only person able to see him. This is a well done independent film that has it's weak spots but overall is very good.
7255,"With the two leads delivering charismatic, fun, and great performances, this movie is propelled by star power, intrigue, and never allowing the audience to be one step ahead of the flick. "" Knight and Day "" is one of those rare movies that just works on every level and is one of those rare movies that is worth full admission. Cameron Diaz has an undeniable charm that has made her not only a major box office draw over the years, but one of the few actresses that can carry any movie past mediocrity. Their facial expressions, non-verbal actions, and then their unique line delivery - just made everything fit together into a delightful comedy. Overall, "" Knight and Day "" is a great film because of its fresh script, great performances, amazing action, great comic timing, breathtaking cinematography, and a fascinating direction."
7251,", "" Grown Ups "" is the perfect film for you. That's why Adam Sandler makes these movies, and that's why they keep doing so well. Their lives are miserable and their families terrible but lovable, but coming together they find its all been a wonderful life. Their beloved coach took them to a swanky eatery to celebrate, when they were kids, and told them to live their lives meaningfully before the "" final "" buzzer sounded."
7257,"Do yourselves a favour and rent the original and save yourselves the horror of Jadens smarmy acting and smart Alec attitude. The story telling was simply awful, everything was just plain rushed. In the original, Daniel spends half the film working on Mr. Miyagi's house. The best scenes from the original are inexplicably absent."
7258,"He also discovers that the children he fathered so anonymously now mean everything to him. Moore and Bening are clearly committed to creating complex, sympathetic portraits of the kids' parents, Jules and Nic. What could be an interesting storyline, children of a lesbian couple finding their biological father and attempting a relationship with him while their mothers' relationship goes through a rough patch quickly descends into weird melodrama that is resolved in the most unsatisfactory way possible. Nic will loosen up and the kids will be able to open up to people because someone finally understands them. And he's searching for something to define him outside of his mothers."
8288,"The overall result is an impeccably paced, brutal but surprisingly uplifting story, beautifully shot against the backdrop of Hong Kong's endless arrays of high - rises and apartment blocks. That being said, the film is shot beautifully and uses a wide variety of creative shots and transitions. The kill rate quickly escalates but is interspersed with a back story of the killers early life and her motives, which bring a little light relief to the ensuing massacre. The killings themselves though far fetched and bloody are gruesomely enjoyable. The cinematography is stylish, the acting is fantastic and the score provide some chills."
7261,"The music, the art direction, the characters, the cast, everything was just great! So if anybody would read this from the fantastic team of creators of this great tale: Please make more! This amazing Batman feature deserves 10 out of 10 stars. What is good about it, they kept the spirit of the Batman comics. One scene in particular is as shocking as anything the Dark Knight had to offer."
7262,"Salt delivers exactly what is promised--a solid 100 minutes of action. If you like the action movie genre, chances are you will enjoy this movie. In "" Salt "", when Angelina Jolie jumps consecutively onto six moving trucks on the freeway, she's flying right up and instantly running at Olympic record pace, sort of like the original Terminator except sporting lipstick. Throughout the movie, she decks secret service agents faster than they can graduate out of combat training if she's not pushing out of moving vehicles going 70 mph while wearing handcuffs, although the officers forgot to put the cuffs on behind her. After a brief prelude in which Jolie is interrogated and tortured by North Korean military agents, the movie begins, presumably about a year later, with a Russian requesting asylum with the United States via the CIA."
7250,"There are a lot of unknowns in dreamworld. its plot - there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns. its rapid storyline - the story moves fast from one scene to another, making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride. Hans Zimmer's unremarkable score works well with the scenes but it would be super boring to hear on its own. The visual effects are good but since all the coolest city - folding scenes were so short, there wasn't really that much to do."
7513,"Quite touching is A Letter to Elia and highly recommended to followers of both. In Reflections on Kazan, actors Alec Baldwin, Al Pacino, Ellen Burstyn, and Robert De Niro who appeared in Elia's The Last Tycoon, among others discuss the director's unique methods and his demeanors and attitudes. Throughout the running time Scorsese makes such comments as Kazan shaped his life in terms of film and even calls him a father figure. ON THE WATERFRONT and EAST OF EDEN are the two films that get the majority of the running time. The EAST OF EDEN comments are also very interesting including Scorsese talking about Dean and the impact of the film's story on him."
8372,"Continuery - Most of the other characters were pretty hard to empathize with. BoB spread the attention around a little better, more perspectives, more chances of finding a person (or several) to love. This phrase seems to be used a lot by reviewers awarding this series high marks when in reality The Pacific is a Luke warm experience which causes a ripple rather than a splash. Its a truly powerful scene and one in which Mazzello does not utter one word, his face says everything and its heartbreaking. The battle scenes are simply epic and wonderfully directed, even if you hate everything else anyone can see the direction is incredible within this series."
7266,"Just as he is beginning to agree with her, he meets Barry (Steve Carell). Despite its interesting characters, "" Dinner for Schmucks "" belongs in a richly deserved doggie bag, but not as a treat. The only positive note is the act of both Steve Carell and Paul Rudd who despite a shaky scenario manage to pull off a great performance. "" Dinner for Schmucks, "" however, goes in for a seven course meal and wears out its welcome. If you go off just the main 2 stars alone this is a must rent."
7268,"Sammo Hung has delivered yet another amazing feat with choreographing this movie, despite his declining health during production. Sammo Hung moves at breathtaking speed and it's a marvel watching Donnie Yen and Sammo Hung duking it out on the big screen. However the direction and the fight scenes are executed so masterfully that it makes the story easy to relate to. His acting is very good and he has perfect moves. The kungfu moves were also well directed."
7269,"Though the story is heavy on the saccharine edge and strains credibility, the team of actors is very fine - especially Zac Efron, whose presence is on the screen in practically every frame - so the film ends up being endearing. The cinematography by Enrique Chediak is gorgeous and the musical score by Rolfe Kent leans heavily on sad love songs. Zac Efron and Charlie Tahan deliver strong performances as the two brothers and Amanda Crew is pretty decent. "" Charlie St. Cloud "" is beautifully filmed, with great artistic scenes and amazing sceneries. All this was clear from the trailer, and in its own way is fairly routine ghost story / psychological drama stuff, executed tolerably well - the pre-accident stuff is done well enough to enable you to empathise with Charlie and Sam, Charlie is understandably morose through much of the remainder, and there is nice brotherly chemistry between Efron and young Charlie Tahan, and young romance chemistry between Efron and Crew."
8514,"Alternating between insouciance and gravity, play and fear, Romain Goupil's film creates wonders with its scenes of secret meetings of a group of young schoolmates, full of freshness and nostalgia, thanks to well - written dialog and appealing comedy. Finely and engagingly directed by French filmmaker Romain Goupil, this humane and political drama which is narrated from multiple viewpoints, draws an incisive and portrayal of the communion between a group of young children who comes together in a protest against the political situation in France during the early 20th century when they learn that one of their friends is being deported from their country. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions and the fine cinematography by Marion Befve, Irina Lubtchansky and MikaÃ«l Lubtchansky, this dialog - driven and compassionately narrated coming - of - age tale which captures the distinctions between the world of children and the world of adults, depicts several studies of character, examines themes like immigration, friendship and courage and contains a fine score by Italian - born French composer Philippe Hersant which emphasizes it's subtle and nostalgic atmosphere. This finely paced and inspiring tale about taking a stand against something one believes in and standing up for someone one cares for, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, the prominent acting performance by Italian - French actress, screenwriter and director Valeria Bruni Tedeschi and the remarkable and intuitive acting performances by all of the young actors and actresses in their debut feature film roles. The neighborhood is basically full of immigrants."
7271,"Then stay tuned for the credits, when the commentary rushes at you full - force. Unlike most Will Ferrell movies, you don't have to shut off your brain in this one; you actually have to pay attention because aside from the comedy, there is a complex crime to solve. But, unlike the other movies, the third act stays afloat thanks to the Wahlberg / Ferrell mix, as well as the continuing mystery that was slowly unfolding. The former "" Saturday Night Live "" writer directed Ferrell in "" Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy "" (2004), "" Talladega Nights "" (2006), and even the popular viral video "" The Landlord "" (2007). This movie has you try to solve the mystery along with Ferrell and Wahlberg, and there are some decent twists and turns that really make you wonder who the culprit is."
7272,While watching this film it was hard to believe that all of this took place such a short time ago and the fact that this own goal was scored against the U. S. Directors Jeff and Michael Zimbalist do a terrific job at building an incredibly tense atmosphere that is constantly flowing throughout the film. 30 for 30: The Two Escobars (2010) **** (out of 4) This entry in the ESPN series is somewhat of a masterpiece even though while watching the thing you have to keep reminding yourself that it's all true and not some sort of strange fiction from Hollywood.
8536,"It is predictable as all things Disney are when it comes to movies. She's planned out her sixteenth birthday party and even though the day starts out horribly when wasps are discovered to be making a nest in the unused attic of her home, she gets those 16 candles from a' magical person' played by Anna Mae Routledge. 16 Wishes is a charming fantasy from that fantasy factory the Magic Kingdom. Overall itsa really good film for the family, and for sleepovers for girlies. She gives her magic candles that will make all her dreams come true from her wish list that Abby made."
7274,"from the start you should know this is all about guns, explosives and one liners from start to finish and homage to silly 80's and 90's action flicks. The heroine is tortured, then dragged through bullets, raging fires and explosions as the whole set is blown up, yet emerges unscathed with perfect hairdo. The expectation for this film is obviously very high with one of the best action hero line ups (if not the best) in cinematic history. It's something fresh, yet feels like it came out of the 80's. The 80's action hero (and villain) breed was a rare phenomenon which will likely die with those very actors who gave them life."
7275,"Scott Pilgrim is one of the most refreshing teen - sophomore movies produced in the last years, and one the best movies of 2010. The movie also pokes gentle fun at hipster subculture with the way that Ramona has thirty plus flavors of tea, or how Scott's roommate is always texting. There are also quirky touches like one girl who can bleep herself out, much to Scott's amazement, and a scene when the intro from Seinfeld plays after the characters enter the apartment, and canned laughter follows every line. Scott is over the moon, but he has to face his own personal demons, break up with sweet Knives and fight for Ramona's love against her seven exes. Now for the rest: Surprisingly, Scott Pilgrim features the best martial arts scenes in years."
7467,"Soon, the screenwriter / aspiring writer has an opportunity to see himself living one of his dreams as well as slowly come to some surprising epiphanies as he discovers more and more who his new acquaintances might truly be, and most important what their dreams really are. The film is set in several time periods, and Paris glows intensely and seductively in everyone of those. From its overcast skies and reflective streets, showing lovely architectural details and its magnificent landmarks to the superb and lovely recreations of older time periods, one can't help being seduced, charmed, and inspired to find a way to show what a special place, and consequently what a truly magical film this might be. Performances are outstanding all around, with Cotillard once again stealing every second she is on the screen. Wilson inhabits the Allen persona, and he does a very good job, not creating a tired imitation, an annoying clichÃ© that could have ruined the perfect balance of sight, sounds, and insightful dialog, keeping this masterpiece way ahead of the best Allen has offered before."
7514,"Albeit you know the chimps are CGI, their eyes look amazing, with depth and personality, and along with their body language and facial animations, you really do forget they are CGI. The journey Caeser takes really connects and you feel his plight. With moments of thought, heart and action, Rise really hits the mark for the audience it's aiming for. What makes this so good is the progression of the main ape' Ceaser' (heh, ironic name), and his journey from a curious and smart ape, into an upset ape that realizes the harsh realities of being treated like an animal. And once again, the Weta team did a phenomenal job with their brilliant special effects."
7533,"There is a very good reason that you do not see people keep chimpanzees as pets â€“ they can be extremely aggressive and powerful animals. Sure it has a fascinating subject in the chimp Nim, but the more fascinating subjects are the humans who inhabit his life. Such is the case with award - winning documentarian James Marsh and his presentation of Project Nim. Equally interesting and perhaps the root cause of what happens later is the relationships between the humans. time together, which actually seemed to be Nim's best time with any humans."
7353,"A modern retelling, good - looking leads, gorgeous cinematography and Neil Patrick Harris? Vanessa Hudgens also gave a cringe - worthy performance. The novel Beastly by Alex Flinn is phenomenal. In the movie, he may be Kyle Kingson instead of Kyle Kingsbury, he may do different things for Lindy's love but the essence of Kyle is the same (entirely to Alex's credit). NPH and the actress who plays Zola (Magda) are also wonderful; the regrettable thing about them is that isn't more scenes with the three of them in the movie."
7380,"Now one could say that there are these great fight scenes thanks to Kato (played by John Cho). Save yourself the money and god forbid the 17 $it costs to see it in 3d. Britt Reid is actually a distant relative of John Reid a. k. a. the Lone Ranger. Both men bring much to the partnership, and both are excellent fighters, just in different styles. Perhaps a real talent for journalism (which he had in the radio & TV shows), a' buddy' relationship with Kato, or even the lovable rich rogue somewhat like Bruce Wayne."
7384,"The special effects are kinda lame and the film drags in certain spots, but overall "" Season of the witch "" is a decent thriller with some cheesy dialouge. With a cast comprised of screen veterans and relative newcomers, this period piece about witchcraft and true nobility will keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. After a gripping prologue which establishes that witches do, in fact, exist and can be quite deadly, the movie dives straight into the heart of the Crusades in the mid-14th Century, the stage for some of the bloodiest and most brutal battles in history; and also some of the greatest abuses of authority by the Christian church. It's a bit of a clichÃ©, but director Dominic Sena handles it very well. The errant knights have no desire to aid the church that has been the cause of so much suffering, but Behmen believes the girl's chances of a fair trial are much higher if they travel with her."
7386,""" Cowboys & Aliens "" is a blast of summer blockbuster fun, delivering fun visual effects, consistently entertaining action, and fun dialogue to spice up the fun. There is a subtle funny line at least every few minutes. The way to win lives is truly amazing. Its 1873; New Mexico Territory; an Outlaw and a Cattle Rancher must put aside their differences to stop Alien invaders hellbent on experimenting on humans and stripping the land of its gold. There's something kooky about the title Cowboys and Aliens, B - movie - ish, yet, exciting, enticing and genius."
7390,"For the first 30 minutes of the movie, there is nothing remotely funny, original or entertaining. Ronny (Vince Vaughan) unwittingly witnesses Geneva (Winona Ryder), the wife of his best friend and business partner Nick (Kevin James) having a clandestine romantic encounter with Zip (Channing Tatum). You'd think that, with all those years in Happy Days, he'd have a good grasp of comedy. But there are some good things in it, and chief among these are the real - and touching - relationships between Vaughan and friend James and, particularly, girlfriend Connelly. Queen Latifah does her best to bring some energy to the film, but her character only has about 3 - 4 scenes."
7394,"The concept of Limitless is fantastic - what would happen if you could take a pill (NZT) that would allow you to use 100% of your brain (instead of the standard 20%) and function on a level higher than you have ever functioned before? 2) The movie needed for the Russian thug to come after Eddie in order to find the NZT, take it and then make trouble for him the entire movie. Impressive 5) Is it really believable that NZT wouldn't have hit the black market and been all over the place? He's all happy now & brilliant forever & running for Senate - he's with his girlfriend & their ordering food and look, he's fluent in a foreign language because he's so smart and YUCK. Overall, in spite of all the shortcomings, Limitless is still a really good movie."
7399,"Andy Lau and Gong Li are two of the most attractive and charismatic superstars of their age and it's a perfect dream match in this romance comedy. The best reward is a visual treat of two fabulous personalities trying to work chemistry on the big screen. What Women Want follows Benny Chan's successful remake of Hollywood's "" Cellular "" in another Asian attempt at similar, this time of a romance comedy genre. Almost every scene is briefly tackled on screen and soon after fleets towards the next, causing the film to feel like a superficial work of neither style nor substance. As a romance comedy, there isn't any quality comedy in it unfortunately to compensate for the lack of good romance chemistry between both leads."
7401,"Romantic comedies need a good kick in the pants, and an aging Ivan Reitman ain't the guy to do it. "" No Strings Attached "" might have been a decent film had it followed through on its premise, but that it falls victim to just about every romcom trapping negates the most potentially interesting thing it has going for it. Sure the ending is predictable and a few of the background actors deliver lackluster performances but Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher fit very nicely together as the main characters, you could really tell they had fun working together. If it wasn't for the great casting of Portman and Kutcher at the center of the film creating superb chemistry all would be lost among ever other rom - com. Like most romantic comedies, you know the ending from the first scene in the movie."
7402,"Lincoln Lawyer is a thrilling drama about a cocky and smooth defense attorney Mick Haller, played by McConaughey, who represents a high - profile client on charges of attempted murder. With the help of that distinct country voice and southern charm, McConaughey takes the movie to another level with this portrayal of the fast - talking lawyer. With the role of Mick, McConaughey is actually given a chance to show off a range of emotions that will truly surprise viewers. When the wealthy Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe) asks Haller to defend him in a case of raping and beating the prostitute Regina Campo (Margarita Levieva), Roulet claims that he is not guilty and the woman is trying to get money from him despite the evidences against him. Matthew McConaughey is excellent in the role of a sleazy and smart defense lawyer that finds that has been used by a psychopath and who has a crisis of conscience for not believing in his client."
7403,"Moi Studios once again perform animation duties, maintaining the smooth character movements seen in their previous productions; smoother than Japanese anime at least and without animation short - cuts. Iv' e been away from superman the comic for quiet some time - but have seen all of the DC movie material that have been available, but non of the other renditions of Supermans story comes close to this one - This knowing that most of the material is from Morrison's: All Star Superman Comic series - the movies overall style is true to the Comic version with bright colors, light humor and great scenes. The animated movie not only sticks to the "" self - contained stories "" format but also the well developed personalities and timeless characterization. An episodic miniseries would have been a better medium to convey the full feel of the original story. Also a really great portrayal of Superman as Clark Kent, and fun to see how he switches between the two in some scenes."
7405,"Good suspense â€” the sound mixers must've had a kick in adding emphasis on sound effects to startle the audience. Granted, there is a good plot twist when he is told who and what he is, but smart people would have noticed something wrong when he drives like a professional, and fights as if he'd been trained to. It may have become a rather over-used plot devise, but it tends to work, in part because pieces of the puzzle can be thrown at the character without him understanding what it means. The two leading ladies also keep the entertainment level high, particularly January Jones (of Mad Men fame) who plays against type, as the loyal wife turned traitor. The movie sounds intriguing since from the beginning and keeps its sense of mystery and intrigue till the end: this is a good quality, once reminding Hitchcock's thrillers, with the difference that in "" Unknown "" the thrilling aspect cannot be separated from the frenzy typical of action movies."
7423,"The two perform an elegant dance of dialogue, Samuel's character from the slant of a straight shooting, Southern ex-con who has found Jesus and Tommy as the depressed, over educated nihilist. This is an excellent film, if you insist on car chases and explosions to enjoy a movie (nothing wrong with that) then steer well clear. The powerhouse combination of Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones. This 90 minute look at two men's opposing beliefs is strong and will resonate with the viewer long after it is over. It gels so well with the words of Cormac McCarthy."
7406,"As with most comedies these days, the trailer gives away much more than it should; but, unlike most, it leaves plenty of laughs and situations for the film. Mr. Helms is really a comic force. Ed Helms, Anne Heche, John C. Riley and Isiah Whitlock Jr. take you on one heck of a funny ride from the very beginning all the way through the end credits. Miguel Arteta did a terrific job directing the talented ensemble. When the insurance company's golden boy dies of auto - erotic asphyxia (which Tim regularly refers to as "" an accident ""), Tim must represent the company at the annual ASMI conference in Cedar Rapids where he must win the coveted Two - Diamond award for excellence or it will cost the company dearly."
7407,"It was fun to pick out the Shakespeare references; the removal firm was Rosancranz and Guildenstern, for instance. In other cases there were misquotes; for instance "" a rose by any other name "" - "" a weed by any other name "" A good bit of fun! The garden gnomes of two neighbouring backyards, the Red Gnomes and the Blue Gnomes, have an ongoing rivalry as to who's garden is best. Shakespeare fans will have fun spotting the little references to the Bard's works (including a cleverly worked in quote from Macbeth of all plays). The animation is great - the gnomes and the gardens are just lovely to watch."
7409,"Here they are not simply goofs, they are likable goofs, the parts have been written with a few more' straight' moments, and honesty to balance the satire. Have been a fan of Pegg and Frost since Shaun of the Dead and enjoy their genius ability to spoof a genre and still make a thoroughly entertaining and funny movie This time it's ET, Close Encounters. An alien has crashed on Earth and now many, many years later he escapes from captivity and hits the road, where he accidentally bump into Graeme Willy and Clive Gollings. Right, well throughout the movie there was a bunch of subtle and not so subtle references to other movies. And it was rather surreal to have a country / hillbilly band play the cantina band music from Star Wars, but it was hilarious."
7412,"Bottom Line: Rango works because of its fresh originality and its refusal to follow the clichÃ©d rules of children animated flicks. No, "" Rango "" won't challenge kids to contemplate their role in the cosmos, but that's precisely the predicament of its main character, a theatrical lizard who finds himself â€” as many animals in animated films do these days â€” thrust out of domestic bliss and forced to reckon with the untamed and unforgiving nature of the wild natural world. Borrowing heavily from classic Westerns (The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly) and Western comedies (The Three Amigos), the film brings reinvents a past formula in an amusingly creative way. But in addition to all its verboseness and abstract homage to classic Westerns, "" Rango "" equally dishes out top - notch physical humor and creative characters for the young ones to lap up, even if they're not exactly of age to, as the film puts at least once, "" ruminate . "" "" Rango "" doesn't quite capture the degree of humor and emotional depth that the Pixar greats of the last few years have, but it's a fun adventure with exquisite animation, tasteful characters and a good heart, which puts it as an above - average offering compared to others of its kind."
7413,"Michael Dowse (who also directed the popular' headbanger' film' FUBAR' and it's sequel) directed. Matt goes to the party with Wendy and his best friend Barry (Fogler) and all hell breaks loose when Barry steals a car from the dealership he was fired from the same day. Topher Grace is very fitting as the film's lead, Palmer looks beautiful and is equally fitting and Fogler is actually good for a change (he's still not really that funny but he gives a decent performance). Faris isn't bad as well and Pratt and Biehn (who's the perfect 80's icon touch, with nerds) give nice supporting performances. The film does a good job of pulling off a classic 80's throwback feel and definitely accomplishes what it set out to do."
7415,"Every move you made was in accordance with a master plan, any kinks or imperfections "" adjusted "" by persons unknown, constantly on hand to ensure you stayed on track. David Norris (Matt Damon) is a rising New York Congressman with his heart set on becoming a young Senator, everything is going according to plan until he meets the beautiful quirky ballerina, Elise (Emily Blunt) in a mens restroom. The many scenes between Blunt and Damon are very believable and natural, real chemistry in action and is fun to watch. A thoughtful and character driven piece about choices and the ripple effect each path taken, or not taken, has on your own and other peoples lives. Terence Stamp, still with one of the best voices in the business, together with Anthony Mackie & John Slattery, do good work as the agents attempting to get everything back on track."
7417,"The parts where Bishop and Steves goes after the big bad guy is quite well done with some quite cool stunts without being over the top. It was marketed as an action film, with good death scenes, mildly intriguing characters, and a simple plot and it delivered exactly on cue. The action scenes are really sublime and they don't stop until the last minute. There are quite a few fairly well done action scenes in the movie ranging from silent assassinations to the obligatory blow things up scenes. Go see this if you just want to see some good action stars kick - butt for a couple of hours."
7418,"in an era of burgeoning comedic genius, this is and pair of wrinkled testes floating in a bowl of warm corona light."
7419,"But the Britons keep up their Gaelic, and they speak it smoothly and fluently, too. It has great action sequences, some fine heroic traits like bravery and courage, and great performances by Channing Tatum (surprisingly), Jamie Bell, Donald Sutherland and other good supporting players. But it is still very good, and for a PG - 13 movie, it has quite some bloody scenes, as a very stark and bleak atmosphere throughout, with a strong sense of unpredictability running throughout the film thanks to very talented director Kevin Macdonald. This is one of the movie's strongest points, proving that simplicity is the key to making some great moments in the film. It brings you into the movie, taking you on a ride through 140 A. D. Scotland as it really should be."
7420,"If you are a girl who has just entered her teens and is tired of movies about whiny vampires, then you might enjoy this. She comes across very natural, so that the love story that unfolds is actually engaging instead of vomit - inducing like that of that other movie with the whining Vampires and the shirtless Werewolves. His role is more of a babysitter for Number Four than a warrior / guardian who dispenses valuable training and wisdom. It had all the trappings for success: based off a semi-popular novel for teens, a fairly accomplished director in D. J. Caruso, the producing "" talent "" of Michael Bay, two hot young stars in Alex Pettyfer and Glee's own Dianna Agron, and an enigmatic, yet intriguing trailer campaign. The film starts out demonstrating how cool the main character is by showing him doing various tricks on a jet - ski while maintaining perfect hair."
7421,"The aliens themselves are pretty cool. But video game enthusiasts would be better served sticking to the virtual battlefield because the shabbiness of this picture is one of its few surprises. One minute everyone will be walking somewhere between point A and B, the next, they're crouching behind burned out cars and houses as aliens pour ungodly hellfire onto them from above."
7424,"The movie uses motion - capture computer animation to apply more realistic textures and movements to its characters, following movies like A Christmas Carol (which wasn't as good), Beowulf (which was much better), and The Polar Express (also much better). Easily the biggest flop of 2011, and pretty close to of all time, this Disney motion - capture film is about a young boy, Milo, who must save his mother (Joan Cusack) from Martians. Like andrewj - lee wrote, how fun to read the obviously planted movie reviews here. There is no explanation of how the Martians breed but the wonderful story can be easy enjoyed by those that have the concept of family, and not hatchery. The Martians come to Earth and abduct Mon, to use her brain to instruct the robots about how to raise children."
7426,"Some laughs come from it, just not many memorable ones. Aniston is the prize winner here. If you do have a weakness for typical comedy movies, but can't seem to find a good one these days, definitely check out this one: laughter guaranteed! Nick Swardson is the clown of the movie, which allows Sandler to act more and leave some of the funny stuff to others. The normal cast of Happy Madisson movies are all there for their usual 2 minutes and all bring their own laugh."
7428,"It has moments of campy fun, specifically every second Gary Oldman appears as a sinister Cardinal Richelieu - type character, but other scenes are played ridiculously straight. Visually, the film is beautiful but the plot is choppy, the romance scenes are cringe worthy, everything about this film was just painful. And she does have a good eye for a shot, and several scenes here show."
7429,"This is a perfect example of Hollywood running out of ideas and only doing re-makes, turning TV shows into movies, prequels and sequels that don't need to be made. At least the movies that appeared in "" Mystery Science Teather 3000 "" were funny to watch, despite being bad. Judging from the financial success of the first two, Big Mommas: Like Father Like Son may be another surprise hit but in this dead zone of cinema, there are far better alternates to view."
7431,"Full of unseen twists and with a high octane pacing, SOURCE CODE will keep you wanting for more as each answer is slowly revealed. Experiencing DÃ©jÃ  vu on every re-entry aboard the train, Colter can remember all of the memories of his previous visits, even though for Christina and the other passengers aboard it's happening for the first time. Colter's ability to act upon free will within the 8 minutes produces the idea that he could positively change the outcome for himself, the passengers, the scientists and most importantly the love interest. The well casted characters are certainly above satisfaction, particularly Vera Farmiga who although is not the love interest will win the heart of the viewer. Vera Farmiga is obviously good in here."
7432,"Charlotte BrontÃ«'s seminal literary work "" Jane Eyre "" has been adapted countless times and prepared in a myriad of ways from the 1943 Joan Fontaine / Orson Welles version that was whittled to an hour and a half to the 1983 BBC mini-series with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton that spans five - plus hours. Fassbender and Wasikowska work terrifically and manage to communicate the class and age discrepancy that made "" Jane Eyre "" a juicy read back in the 19th Century. Other than a terrific performance from Amelia Clarkson as young Jane, the early chapters involving Lowood School seem to be of less significance in this version other than the very clear point to establish Mr. Brocklehurst as an insensitive headmaster and clearly spell out Jane's early traumas that have affected her perspective. Rather than telling the tale in a linear fashion, it begins at a crisis moment later in the story, and tells the majority of the tale in flashback â€“ - which works wonderfully well, enabling screenwriter Moira Buffini to effectively compress a long novel into a two - hour time span. Michael Fassbender embodies Mr. Rochester with the ideal blend of charisma and sinister brooding, while at the same time allowing glimpses of his underlying desperation and the wounded depths of his soul."
7433,"The abundant CG is stunningly beautiful and doesn't feel overdone or become visually exhausting like some movies. In terms of sheer originality, this movies narrative style is right up there with classics like Pulp Fiction and Memento, but there is a downside to this - you need to keep an open mind. the fight scenes are an absolute nerdgasm, a sci - fi / fantasy orgy of epic proportions. Oh yeah, and one more thing: If someone fights for your right to breathe free, fight for the next person's right. Sweet Pea sacrifices her body - Babydoll - and retreats into the comfort of her own mind, a paradise over which nobody has control of but her."
7438,"this wasn't the best star wars out of the family guy trilogy but was good. There are some moments of pure gold in the film (a Stormtrooper pillow fight,' Death Star' design flaws, Green versus MacFarlene and Louis / Leia's protestations about her treatment in captivity, for example, are standouts which raised big laughs), but on the whole, it's a simply watchable affair. The jokes are quite good mostly with a few good laughs here and there. The Family Guy series did a decent job of parodying Star Wars in general before introducing this trilogy of parodies and this shows that the parodies for Star Wars have gotten somewhat stale. The first Star Wars spoof was endlessly enjoyable, casting favourite Family Guy characters as the now classic characters from the Star Wars universe, providing a fresh slant on the old story."
7440,"Director Jason Eisener is a master of cinematic displays of blood and guts, and god bless him for it because it takes the film to a whole other level. This film has a superb nostalgic look, and it's one of the most colorful and vibrant movies projected on screen. Hobo is a tribute to the old exploitation movies of the 70's, based on a fake trailer from the Grindhouse double feature. "" Grindhouse "", "" Machete "", and "" Drive Angry 3D "" are all strong staples to the beloved subgenre, but "" Hobo "" is where its at. "" Hobo "" had one scene exposing those jugs, and it actually fit the mood because of its humor."
7441,"Win Win is a charming delightful film about an ordinary family dealing with the struggles of everyday life. Paul Giamatti â€“ a true everyman actor â€“ delivers a wonderful performance as a lawyer and wrestling coach struggling with the challenges of family and money in New Jersey. It's funny, even hilarious; it has mystery and action; and it features brilliant performances by the always - reliable Paul Giamatti and Amy Ryan. It's a typically masterful Giamatti performance, and for once he's not a total loser who's in over his head. A few years back, Ryan turned in an Oscar - nominated performance as a native Bostonian in Gone Baby Gone."
7443,"The content is largely humorous, whether it's the quirky behaviours of the kids, the older brother Rodrick or even the Heffley parents. One of the potential pitfalls of a family movie is having jokes that are too hard for children understand. Be it manipulating his little brother to achieve his motives, or embarrassing his little brother for his own pleasure, or even to passing on his little brother the "" good "" stuffs With more diaries to come, this series will definitely gain greater popularity among the young readers. Unlike the book, the movie is worth watching for adults as well."
7445,"While technically amazing HOP is filled with unfinished scenes, unfulfilled moments, characters who amount to nothing, silly dumb scenes that go nowhere and worst of all the tediously unfunny Russell Brand. Visual effects will get Academy nominated, story borrows from the various Christmas movies, live action acting is OK, but the music is great. Many reviewers have claimed that it is a combination of "" Willy Wonka "" starring in a holiday themed film and it actually work out splendidly. Granted the characters are plagued with a lack of informative tidbits of the world surrounding them is just a sample of how perfect timing the comical factors are in "" Hop "". The visuals with CGI bunnies and the Easter Island Wonka factory is fun but it all continually falls short of amounting to anything."
7447,"Saoirse Ronan is brilliant as Hanna. The only truly great performance comes from Ronan, but Tom Hollander, Cate Blanchett and Eric Bana all turn out good performances that serve the picture well. It is true that Hanna suffers from a few plot holes, but that plot is delivered in such an appealing, exciting and above - all entertaining film that anyone who isn't compiling continuity errors for some god - awful TV programme that relishes in the fact that THIS ISN'T REAL LIFE, IT'S ACTUALLY ONLY A FILM! The composition and direction of this film are really quite extraordinary with scene after scene catching the eye and making the commonplace clichÃ©s of the action genre seem fresh. The choice of music is inspired and the way that is has been synced to the action serves to heighten the tension in the scenes."
7449,"Arthur is made with a view to entertaining it's viewers and does a pretty good job of it, IMHO (but hey, a packed theatre of people laughing would not mean anything, right?) Helen Mirren is delightful - every 30 yr old would love to have her as a nanny:) You find yourself rooting for Arthur turning himself around to end up with this girl he loves Naomi (Greta Gerwig) There are some genuine funny scenes notably with a magnetic bed, children's store, the Batmobile getting pulled over (yes, really) and when Arthur goes nail gun happy with future father - in - law Burt Johnson perfectly played by Nick Nolte. Greta Gerwig as the love interest Naomi Quinn is on likable form while Jennifer Garner refreshingly goes against all American girl typecast as socialite Susan Johnson. But what this has in bucket loads is a grand sense of heart."
7450,"Jesse Eisenber and Anne Hathaway did their best voice acting. Visually stunning Rio is brilliant stroke of writers to add magic to adventures and love tale of endangered bird "" Blu "". An easy going adventure with fun and random musical numbers and breath - taking scenery. Brilliant animation in 3d will take you on Journey of adventure and fun!"
7451,"It's done so well it can't be anything other than achingly familiar. The positive reviews of this film come from the unctuous and obsequious art house critics, who are incapable of forming an opinion which differs from their equally narrow minded friends, for the fear of being ostracised. Presently, the film has received mostly positive reviews and was praised for the imagery used throughout the film. To be specific it shines first five minutes and then the last say 20 seconds."
7452,"And Branagh's competent direction, the excellent performances and the solid screenplay make Thor to be a very entertaining movie. Now, the honored actor and director of the dramatic cinema and theater Kenneth Brana demonstrated miracles by taking off a large - scale fantasy comics epic. Possessing not only impressive physical training and memorable appearance, Hamsworth was able to convey the power and emotions of this character."
7456,"To really appreciate this masterpiece of television cinema, the first step is to outgrow the original starring Ms. Crawford. Judging solely based on the performances of the original characters of the 1940's version, the luscious black and white cinematography, and Ms. Crawford, it would be easy to dismiss the 2011 version. However if you look at the 2011 version as a standalone piece of grownup film making and the viewer is indeed a grownup who appreciates subtleties, this is one of the best modern movies ever made for television. Many complain about its pace, they whine that this new version doesn't have a bang of an ending, they complain that Winslet is not a heroine, and how is it possible for Veda to become so great as a singer in such a short time. Winslet, an Oscar winner, manages to perform like a stage school brat, all gaspy mouthed at every turn, Pearce's cad a dull pastiche."
7457,"This is a must - see movie for anyone wanting to see more quality films and less action - packed / violence ridden / computer enhanced drivel at the theaters. Water for Elephants is pure beauty. While the leads (Robert Pattinson, Reese Witherspoon, Christoph Waltz) all turn in GREAT performances, the real star here is Tai the elephant. Most Spectacular Show on Earth, who is brought in in hopes of taking The Benzini Bros. circus to a new level (particularly to the level of Ringling Bros.). Water for Elephants is a beautiful, enchanting, mesmerizing must - see."
7458,"This is well produced (if over narrated), has some good scenes and an interesting story. Also, The Last Lions was much more dramatic and engaging. Cynics will point to the film's release coinciding with that of The Lion King to accuse Disney of trying to fleece families, while some will find the child - friendly voice - over cloyingly sentimental, but it marks a bit of a change for cinematic nature documentaries and at least they had the good sense to stick to 2D. The Last Lions did everything right. The stories of the lions and the cheetahs are nicely balanced and bring some dynamic variety to the footage; the bigger cats are as impressive and noble as you'd expect, but the cheetahs often steal the show, thanks to the cubs' undeniable cuteness and Sita's mind - boggling multi-tasking prowess and intelligence."
7468,"As a parent, it's easy to spot the vulnerabilities that a child faces before they have the maturity to handle it. Just like those other famous brothers, the Coens, their films are instantly recognizable. The first part of the film is full of extremely strong dramatic scenes. That such simple things have such great dramatic meaning, is the power of the Dardenne's film making. The events after Cyril has found his father are not as intense as the first scenes, but still make good cinema."
7460,"So if you're looking for adrenaline pumping action, seat rumbling roars of the hottest cars, beautiful people looking beautiful even when being shot at then you got yourself the definition of a popcorn film, meant to entertain you in every single way and this is popcorn done right. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Dwayne Johnson lead this all - star all - action movie with outrageous stunts, incredible cars and beautiful girls that pushes the limits into the red and beyond! They do what any international fugitives would do: rob a train, double cross a local crime lord named Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) and his right - hand man Zizi (Michael Irby), put themselves on the radar of a ludicrously musclebound U. S. Diplomatic Security Service agent (Dwayne Johnson), and set out to steal untold millions from Reyes. Everything about this film is awesome! Pros: Good pace throughout the movie Decent storyline and plot Good Cast of actors / actresses Imaginative and inventive elements throughout Plenty of "" Wow "" moments Cons: Would be nice to have more screen time for the cars a couple of cheesy moments (but this adds to the humor of the film) Overall: Highly recommended film, Just be sure to stay until the end of the credits!"
7462,"Not only does Rachel sleep with her best friend's fiancÃ©, she doesn't TELL her best friend her mistake, she sleeps with Dex again, encourages Darcy to marry this guy who is cheating on her and doesn't love her, and then contemplates telling Dex that Darcy cheated on HIM. And why does everyone in these romantic comedies have to be upper - class and from good heritage? Ginnifer Goodwin was fantastic in the role (not her fault the storyline is idiotic). Colin Egglesfield is beautiful, though a bit stiff, and perfect to play the part of the swine Dex. Well played roles by Ginnifer Goodwin and John Krasinski keep the viewer engaged and entertained."
7463,"Her best friend that she's known for years is Lillian (Maya Rudolph). Adding a little bit of joy to Annie's life is patrol officer Nathan Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd) as they start to slowly connect. ' If you enjoy this kind of shrieking, along with references to various bodily functions and wedding parties so extreme they'd make royalty look mild, you will like Bridesmaids. It's been directed by Paul Feig, under the watch of producer Judd Apatow and many have touted this as a female version of The Hangover (2009). There are very few scenes in Bridesmaids that feel honest or genuine."
7464,"There's a very well done animated prologue and stunning sets and photography of the apocalyptic plain field. Combining elements from Blade, Star Wars and the classic western, Priest is awesome and such delivers big time in the butt kicking department. Perhaps most memorable would be the tech on display in the film which includes futuristic motorcycles, tricked out shotguns and the Priests' arsenal of deadly cross-themed blade weapons. But as the duo soon discover, reports of the vampires' return have been greatly understated. The Priests themselves call to mind stories of War veterans who were shunned by society and unable to re-integrate, a theme made most famous in "" Rambo: First Blood ""."
7465,"It does have some dark, scary moments in between the comedy and melodrama. Although it's difficult to watch Mel Gibson now without the backdrop of alcoholism, abuse, bigotry, rants and disappointment, this role may actually be the perfect role for him to re-appear on the screen with sympathy and hope of redemption. You will occasionally laugh, and at times you will tense up during some of Gibsons darker moments. Once seen as a great actor and visionary director, Mel Gibson has fallen dramatically, with his private dramas overshadowing his on - screen talent. The moral of the film is quite uplifting: life isn't perfect and no - one is completely happy, but as long as you have someone to share it with, you'll be OK."
7466,"The scenes where he escaped from the King and the clutches of the Spanish were a reminder of how great Pirates of the Caribbean can be at its best. The infamous addition of mermaids was the best part in the entire film. Again he had his moments just like Barbosa that were fun and creative but he even came up a little lackluster in certain scenes. For some odd reason, they borrowed far too much from the novel (whose pacing and themes far differ that of the Pirates brand) and forgot that sometimes simplicity is best --- which is what made Curse of the Black Pearl such a great film. With the exception of the mesmerizing and chilling mermaid sequence and the opening chase, all the action moments were missing that special touch."
7493,"It was a cute movie with some pretty funny scenes, but it didn't have a memorable story, or anything really to let you love it. The best of Pixar's films have protagonists who are a small part of a very large world and are almost helpless against incredible odds - Toy Story, Wall - E, Finding Nemo etc. . Cars and Cars 2 are intelligently written and filled with more detail than you could comfortably fit into a single screening. Each film has its own appeals and drawbacks. and most important, they bring entertainment to the audience, and "" Cars 2 "" fills all those gaps."
7470,"This film is presented in 4 distinct acts, each lasting between 30 - 45 mins. It leaps forward and back in time, setting up the individual characters and their roles in the drama. The next sequence, lasting about 30 minutes, is a very impressionistic journey through space, time and evolution. This mirrors the love - hate relationship that each character has with goodness. Any release from Terence Malick is highly anticipated because, let's face it, "" prolific "" is not exactly his middle - name."
7471,"There were some good moments, but the truly outrageous / original scenes that made the original so great were too few and far between. What made The Hangover fun and entertaining unfortunately leads to predicatability in The Hangover II. But honestly after watching it a few times, it seems less funny where as many comedies you pick up on small things on multiple viewings that make the movie even funnier. Its funny, sure, but it's really just embarrassing to come to terms with the knowledge that these writers think that the viewers of this movie are so stupid that they won't mind the similarities. After all, The Hangover made over 200 million dollars world wide, they are going to milk it for everything that it's worth."
7472,"for example: "" The girl they tried to rob and rape comes asking for seconds "". A reviewer from South Africa says, "" The dialogue was apparently authentic, but it sounded made up, like the droogs' language in A Clockwork Orange . "" All in all, it makes for a good Thursday or Friday night at the movies. A friend just said' you like sci - fi movies right?"
7473,"Despite the fact, that there are some elements, like "" randomly "" places cameras on the ground, always shooting the important thing or running and screaming and still shooting the right direction and things like these, pretty decent movie. The movie has great scene and it has stupid moments. There is everything you would expect from "" real "" horror movie. First of all this is one of those first person footage shaky cam movies. Then there are the interviews, which do have a sincere quality to them."
7475,"Animation is superb, characters greatly orchestrated, voice - acting is top - notch, fights are well choreographed and there is enough humor to make you feel that you have regained your childhood back! With ingenious methods, the actions scenes are executed. The first "" Kung Fu Panda "" was a big surprise for moviegoers around the world. Director Jennifer Yuh Nelson knew how to tell it's story through it's colors very well with the film having a very heavy focus on the color red during evil moments of the film and calming green colors during quieter moments. The villain, Lord Shen, is one of the best villains that DreamWorks has ever created."
7476,"Their chemistry is electric--theirs' is one of the most multi-faceted and sincere bromances the screen has seen in a good long while. Both have terrific character arcs that - in a lesser X-Men movie - might have been the highlight of the film. Oh, some bears up, but by and large this is a whole new origin story, a reboot of epic proportions, and yet it is a retcon so cleverly done, and one that offers up a such a delicious mÃ©lange of complex relationships and sensible motivation, that all of the many discrepancies inherent in having Mystique on the side of good or having Moira McTaggert a CIA agent simply do not matter. Speaking of McTaggert, Rose Byrne is both comely and convincing in the role, and almost every other actor is perfectly, one might almost say forcefully, cast. Michael Fassbender has great screen presence and does a good shift as the Magneto to - be and Mr Bacon adds another interesting element to the story."
7480,"The alien, who is a really a spider (Arachnaphobia) that has been collecting items so that he can get home (E. T.), has the ability to make a psychic connection with humans (Close Encounters). Save yourself 2 hours of life and 8 bucks and do anything else."
7482,"Green Lantern is unpretentious, probably even one of the most unpretentious superhero movies ever made. Peter Sarsgaard is a great actor and he plays the villainous Hector Hemmond really well and interesting. Overall everyone tries their best and at the end of the day do a really great job, certainly no Oscar worthy performances, though. It's a fabulous journey and one which is responsible for the enjoyment of the cinema, A great slice of DC comics transformed into the stuff of imagination and the world of Entertainment. The 3D was actually really good and the special effects were memorable."
7484,"Mr. Popper's Penguins, though, filled the bill nicely. It was so rushed while everything else in this movie turned out great. Carrey was funny as always, and added a lot to the over all enjoyment of the film. Jim Carrey is at his best--annoyingly over - the - top as a slick sales executive, genuinely bonding with his surrogate children as time goes on--a virtual "" Marty Poppins . "" Just grab your loved ones, head to the theaters, and enjoy this movie for what it is, don't take it seriously, and you will have a great time!"
7485,"When Elizabeth meets the substitute teacher Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake), she discovers that he is very rich and she flirts with him. Truly one of the funniest movies in recent memory. Further, she learns that Scott likes big breasts and she decides to have a surgery of silicone - implant. This comedy is one of the greats, it pulls no punches and has it all. How many millions of dollars went into this which could have been used better in some other venture?"
7486,"this was a very good movie and would recommend it to anyone interested in seeing robots you played with as kid come to life. The action and CGI is really exciting to look at and a getaway for some viewers when they see a film; robots transforming from cars, buildings collapsing from the sky, soldiers flying into battle in wing suits, and what must have been thousands of explosions all in 3D. This movie added some serious effects to it with the robots. Indeed, some of the robots seem to emote better that the live cast. Spread over a bottom - numbing two - and - a-half hours, "" Transformers: Dark Of The Moon "" can also induce mental and metal fatigue, especially with the clanging robots smashing one another - and the whole exercise making little sense."
7487,"While the plot itself is no great shakes, it's very interesting, especially in these times of disheavelment. Larry Crowne (Tom Hanks), a middle aged man, who works at U-mart, and loves life and his job. She nails the character, Mrs. Tainot, beautifully. Mr. Takei (of Star Trek fame) provides some of the few laughs in the film as a very meticulous Economics professor."
7488,"James Franco is being himself but also gets plenty of laughs jabbing away at the image of the handsome prince who writes poetry while also being handy with a sword. James Franco, as Fabious, the charming prince, is fantastic, always happy, empowering and in love, making his character seems that was taken from a fairytale, even his movements and expressions are totally inspired by everything a charming prince means and does. Danny McBride, as Thadeous, is completely the opposite, the real anti-hero image, full of envy, anger, hate and jealousy, searching and making everything just to satisfy his very own ego. Screenwriters Danny McBride and Ben Best did an excellent job together creating an uncommon tale based on mythologies and sex into a medieval and puritan world, that's why is so funny, because you never expect so serious characters talking about sex and genitals like something simple and ordinary. James Franco and Zooey Deschanel have an infectious sweetness that makes you want to run home and proclaim your undying love!"
7490,"They chose Henry Paulson (William Hurt), ex-Goldman Sachs CEO turned Treasury Secretary. This shortcoming aside, the film clips along nicely, and it's fun to see so many name actors portraying the Wall Street titans. If you intend to watch this movie for entertainment purposes - probably you can pick something better than financial meltdown, however if you intend to watch this movie for the purpose of better insight on what really happened - you should skip it and look further. there is a good reason why banking industry calls equity stocks "" stock markets retard brother "". Paulson doesn't even has to bother one day to write himself a beautiful perky biography, script of this movies will do just fine."
7492,"But what's fascinating here is how the main three had a perfect chemistry to their horrible bosses. The entire film is all about the laughs and the fun. Most of the fun goes to the performances. Some great scenes involving crude / sexual / racial humor that catch you off guard and have you rolling. Jennifer Aniston very outside her standard girly role, and it was awesome."
7495,"Page One is a provocative film that explores the complexities of the new media landscape in which the New York Times now finds itself trying to compete and keep its head above water. It's a fun scene watching him shoot down an aggregator during a debate. But the movie's at its best when it's about the newsroom, and this is compelling stuff: decisions being made during the Wikileaks info dump, Iraq withdrawal, and the laying off o a great deal of the paper's workforce. You do get to be a fly on the wall, and during these scenes, it's good stuff. Intimidating as it inspires, Page One pushes cameras into one of the highest - pressure environments around and captures a few human moments in the midst of empire - cleaving times."
7496,"As made for TV movies go, this was very good. This movie is so hilarious and exciting from the first seconds right to the last frame. Sometimes it is amusing but it is never hilarious; sometimes it has action but it is never exciting; it just tends to have a little bit of everything to make it passable for those willing to go along with it. , or the realistic, down - to - earth plots (any Evil Dead you care to name), one watches for Bruce. It was predictable and a bit preachy, and the mention of the SOA was bordering on heavy - handed, but Bruce charms and smirks his way through it and makes an otherwise forgettable bit of tripe an actual pleasure to watch."
7500,"* End of Spoilers * All in all, all of the personality and charm of the series was zapped away in an attempts to make this final movie is action - packed as possible. Snape's memories are rushed and they take out some of the most interesting memories. * ** SPOILERS ** THE GOOD: Snape's and Voldemort's characters were played quite well. Thank you to everyone involved in these movies for taking the world on such an amazing journey. This movie, along with the rest in the series, will be loved for years and years to come."
7501,"It is a picture perfect reflection of the films from the late 60's, 70's and 80's. It is far better to imagine what Gosslings character has done to arrive at this point, than to be shown in some cheesy flash back sequence. Or maybe you just need more imaginary computerized cars doing spectacular things on screen to hold your attention. The fact is this is a fantastic film, filled with great performances, and some of the best chase sequences since bullet. This movie just barely makes it above the big B."
7502,"Everything was portrayed swiftly, without padding, The plot was very well thought out. It grounded the film and made everything play out in a more real world tone with real consequences. Production value is high, featuring lots of good (if not overly - slick) sets, props, costumes and special effects. The sets were nice, and the other stars filled their roles well. Only a few funny moments and the fantastic CG "" scrawny Steve "" got this to three stars."
7503,"It also follows Jacob's relationship with the absolutely stunning Hannah (Emma Stone), throws in a bit of curveball with Emily being romanced by David (Kevin Bacon), and even has a bit of a focus on Cal's son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) pining over his older babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton). While the impeccable cast is more than enough reason why the film succeeds so well in being an atypical film in the genre, it is the crew behind - the - scenes that surprises even more. Weaving between the plots lines, they make the film feel unique and different from others, all while giving it an aura of authenticity. While they stumble a bit in the final act with a series of sitcom - like shockers that border on ludicrous, they manage to pull off the rare feat of actually making the audience wonder if these characters will all end up together in the end, or if they will walk their separate ways; something that is truly uncommon for this genre. Acting wise, the film delivers in spades."
7504,"The final third of the film, shunned by a few reviewers, elevated the creative vision of the story because it introduces the unpredictable nature of real life into a movie that was otherwise a run - of - the - mill romance. The story that takes place in One Day is at moments the anti love story and other times a sweeping epic romance, even though this movie has been adapted from a book it's still a lot more original than other romantic themed films of late. It explores each character's journey to happiness and the trials they face along the way. The European setting was beautiful and added to the scenes from the city to country side building the romance of it all. Director Lone Scherfig (An Education) paints the picture of Em and Dex's up and down relationship with great finesse, never having too much happen on the date year to year."
7505,"Brendan Gleeson is usually natural, making the character he plays fit like a glove â€” whether the robust and humorous loyal buddy and the warrior, as in "" Braveheart "" (1995), or a quiet and subdued aspiring politician, as in "" Gangs of New York "" (2002), or a non-supportive father, civil war volunteer - turned - deserter, as in "" Cold Mountain "" (2003), whether the gentle, mentoring, culture - exploring hit man in hiding, as in "" In Bruges "" (2008), or on the other side of the law, the grouchy police sergeant with defiant, often dissident sense of humour (provocative in one - liners like "" being FBI, don't you prefer to fight unarmed women and children Screenplay writer John Michael McDonagh's directorial debut, "" The Guard "" (2011) is really a fine movie, relying the least on the originality of its story, describing criminal proceedings of the group of cocaine drug - smugglers and their interaction with local police, set against the backdrop of small - town western Ireland, however, filled with crackling good dialogue, sparkling with wisecracks, accompanied with nice scenery and pleasant, unobtrusive music. But, what makes it the best is its protagonists' performances. Michael McDonagh is the brother of one of the funniest writers in the world just now. The international drug smugglers being chased are a trio led by Liam Cunningham and the always interesting Mark Strong."
7506,"Children who go to see this movie may love it, but adults may love it more. The dialogue is delightfully droll, with a lot for children and adults to enjoy. Every character has their fair of great moments, from Eeyore's tail contest to Rabbit's silly antics later in the movie. Even the "" scariest "" scenes won't freak out the little ones, and everything is so calm, so tender, and so unobtrusive it's wonderful. The animation, the voices, the story, and the good old Winnie the Pooh feeling, all mixed with the great songs and hilarious dialogue made this movie truly special."
7507,"The movie could use some more suspense in the last 20 minutes of it, and a better first scene. The first feral grabs what looks to be a 2x4 or a rectangular piece of steel and manages to chop the abusive father's son right in half! The film's director was obviously trying to create something unique and different but it's definitely no "" Martyrs "". In a perfect world they should hand Sean Bridgers, who plays the father, the Oscar for best actor now and be done with it. It's a pretty common theme that's been done dozens of times before."
7509,"They are enjoying playing around 3Ds. Of course, The Smurfs does not exactly have enough substance to hold a full - grown adult's attention for all of its 86 minutes, but it is a surefire hit with the kids. Humor, again, mainly appeals to the kids, sporting sight gag after sight gag, but every once in a while there's a clever reference thrown in for the older folks in the audience. On the other hand, where it is used the CGI is incredibly high - quality (i. e. the Smurfs, Gargamel's cat, etc.), and the special effects are designed more specifically for 3 - D viewing than in most movies as of late. The Smurfs is mildly entertaining, at its best, but it is written with the right spirit and is in no way an injustice against the original series."
7511,"Even though you know what is coming, the honesty with life's little quirks and human behavior was incredibly well done. Down to earth, but an air of success and confidence, hidden in all the girly dreams and fairy - tales. Two friends who despise romance decide to add a bit of love making to their friendship without any complications. What's funny is that even though it does contain the usual ClichÃ© scenes that most romantic adult comedies contain, it does tend to poke fun at them and have some sort of realism to the plot. Both Timberlake and Kunis are likable and really funny."
7512,"It's a nice little study on the cynicism and selfishness of today's culture and how someone with a good heart and a sunny disposition just gets taken advantage of and abused for being decent. There are a lot of funny moments throughout, most of them coming from Paul Rudd who plays a unique character for him (the rest of the actors were cast exactly in their wheelhouse) and is really just charming and kind the whole time. The movie's impressively talented and good - looking cast includes Zooey Deschanel, Emily Mortimer, and Elizabeth Banks (looking a lot like Parker Posey) as sisters. Ned is a sweet idealist who believes the best about his fellow humans and rarely is disappointed. It really isn't about Ned's philosophy of expecting the best of others and seeing the good in them because even thought some people don't, and it can hurt you, more people do and everyone is better for it."
7515,"If you're a Ryan Reynolds or Jason Bateman fan (or a fan of body switching movies) you'll almost certainly enjoy this film at least some what, despite it's rocky take off. Leslie Mann (otherwise known as Mrs. Apatow) and Olivia Wilde co-star as the men's two love interests, one is Dave's wife and the other is his co-worker. In Atlanta, Dave Lockwood (Jason Bateman) is an efficient and dedicated lawyer that expects to be promoted to partner of the law firm where he has been working for ten years after a merging operation and a family man, married with the gorgeous Jamie Lockwood (Leslie Mann) and father of three children. ' THE CHANGE - UP': Three Stars (Out of Five) It's not the 80's anymore and Hollywood is still making body changing movies! The writing is funny, but the comedic timing and performances were just so perfect and what truly made the film hilarious!"
7516,"A note about the performances â€” Bryce Dallas Howard as the conservative, prejudiced Hilly, is remarkably successful, making her a full - fledged actress and not just a famous director's daughter. Jessica Chastain as the ditzy but big - hearted Celia Foote cements her place as a great modern actress following her memorable role as the compliant wife in Tree of Life. It does elicit the "" Great White Hope "" character, in that the maids only come together through the unlikely liberalism and goodness of a young white character. e. g. Will Smith, Halle Berry and Beyonce. This is an incredible film that not only pays justice to the bestseller on which it's based (according to those who have read the book AND seen the film), but is phenomenally cast, with exceptional performances by Viola Davis, Emma Stone, Octavia Spencer, Bryce Dallas Howard and Allison Janney."
7517,"Nick (played by Jesse Eisenberg of The Social Network) is a pizza delivery boy who gets jumped by a pair of goons (Danny McBride, Nick Swardson), and strapped with a bomb and an ultimatum: rob a bank within ten hours or face the explosive consequences. It's as if, in half the movies these days, and this is a perfect example of one, the writers have no clue as to how to write dialogue, so they decide to talk dirty for an hour and a half and call it good. First time screenwriter Michael Diliberti (previously credited as executive assistant to producer Scott Rudin) blunders his way past a great premise to lowest common denominator comedy. The film was directed by Ruben Fleischer, whose previous film, "" Zombieland "", was much better. The best comedies cull humor from character flaws, and while the cast of 30 Minutes or Less has those to spare, human foibles have little bearing on the way these people behave."
7519,"It might have the same theme as the first four movies, but unlike the first four, it's on a much higher scale. Deaths here are top notch, very blunt and very cringe worthy. The story, as other reviewers have mentioned, really sets FD5 up to good prospects. All in all, FD5 brings unexpected new life to the dying franchise. If you want to see the film, by all means see it in 3D because it is worth every penny."
7521,"Everyone is criticizing the 3D as gratuitous, but it was part of the humor, exaggerated like in Piranha 3D. Morally wrong on soo many levels and unnecessarily filmed in 3D but that somehow managed to work pretty well for the most part but this film is so much fun and hysterically funny that you will have a blast. Sure making a baby high, John having his penis stuck to a metal frozen pole, and poking fun at the Catholic sex scandals may be inappropriate to some, but everything's fair in comedy and what the filmmakers have done will make you laugh over and over. A lot of the humor uses or pokes fun at the 3D effects so see it in 3D if you can, it's a real treat, the effects are great. And for the most part the 3D is worth it and it actually plays a crucial part in the movie since the plot brings out and gives 3D scenarios."
7523,"Of all the horror movies that come out this year, this will probably be the one you will have the most fun at. Tom Holland's 1985 vampire romp "" Fright Night "" was a fun, campy little horror flick that had some good laughs, good scares, and some pretty awesome effects. Then he meets Jerry Dandrige, a buff, sweet new neighbor that Charley's mom and Amy take a liking to. While it pays so much respect to the original movie, "" Fright Night "" also adds a few new elements that elevate it above other remakes. There are some scenes that are lifted right from the original, even two of the original's most classic lines, but the movie breaks several horror movie rules and invents new ones, like whether or not a vampire can come into another person's house."
7524,"These and a host of other theories and possibilities are tossed around for the audience concerning not only a mirror planet, but about past events and moving forward. She must now decide between confronting her demons and telling John the truth or escape her past and start a new life on the other Earth. Kumar Pallana has very few scenes in this movie but plays a vital role in mentoring Rhoda into redemption. It is about looking at a mirror image of one's self as opposed to assuming everything is perfect. Her celebration is short - lived when after a night of partying, crashes her car into a vehicle driven by John Burroughs' (William Mapother), instantly killing his wife and son."
7528,"Action and sexy Zoe Saldana sells it all. There is plenty of action and a good mix between Hollywood fireworks and realistic fights. It has moments of love and drama, and then it brings out the action and suspense. She moves like a ballerina and fights like an anorexic tiger, and she even achieves mild success in playing drunk comedicly (in a campy sort of way). Fast - forward and enter Zoe Saldana as adult Cataleya as the rest of the film takes place, strangely enough, in 2007."
7531,"The scenarios are a romance story between the class president and a ruffian, another love story between a dweeb and a beautiful sophomore, a small side story about a guy trying to get someone to come to a prom, another story of deceit and betrayal, and finally a story about an ideal relationship hitting a rocky course. These funny, although weak, scenes gave the film a little more pace and took away from the drawn out drama. However, it is a cute, high school soap opera that will entertain those that like to see happy endings and smiles. It perfectly matches with all of the scenes."
7532,"It was really fascinating to see America circa 1964 in full color (most footage from that era is black & white). One of the most fascinating segments of the film was early on when they delved into how Kesey was turned onto LSD. His "" trip "" is supported with inspired graphics so that the viewer can feel that he / she is also "" tripping "" for 2 minutes."
7534,"Oh, it definitely wasn't anything out of the ordinary or unpredictable, but just like the show, it's able to still be completely hilarious and really touching when it comes down to it. But if you're the sort of person who liked the TV series, doesn't think they are a "" chav "" by eating McDonalds and likes fart jokes then you will really enjoy this movie. The film is meant to be a fair well to the guys after three very successful TV series and the lads go out in style. The film is very funny and has numerous laugh out loud moments, but the great thing is the spirit of the film. Few social taboos are left undisturbed, and when you couple this with the notion that filmmakers can get away with a lot more on the big screen (a saying that rings especially true for The Inbetweeners), it is recommended that fence - sitters have a long think about how they feel about the series, lest they return home with the unexplained compulsion to take a boiling hot bath and scrub until a little skin comes off."
7535,"The prospect of that last month of freedom before they make a commitment to something other than themselves opens up a fissure in their lives and threatens to destroy a complacency they had begun to take for granted. The passing of time is also reflected in this character and appear feelings like frustration or even desperation to be adopted. Somehow they think society or the universe owes them something and just by dreaming big, their lives will be complete. Ms. July is a fabulous observer of life and people and personalities. The image of Jason peacefully sleeping over Sophie's chest (sweet for some, twee for others) is also a very faithful representation of true love, as well as Jason's attempt to stop time forever reflects very well how heartbreak feels."
7536,"But in focusing on a group of dedicated violence interrupters, writer Alex Kotlowitz and documentary filmmaker Steve James ("" Hoop Dreams ""), stepping away from his usual sports focus, capture the cycle of violence in such a complete way that you can finally start to see how it could in fact end. Like any great documentary, "" The Interrupters "" is a conversation starter. It is a powerful film that captures the plague of urban violence that plagues are cities â€“ in this case Chicago â€“ and goes beyond documenting to show a group of activists (many with troubled pasts) working for a group called Ceasefire. The Interrupters was also co-produced by sociologist Alex Kotlowitz, who wrote the popular novel "" There Are No Children Here: The Story of Two Boys Growing Up in the Other America, "" a profoundly eye - opening book on the lives of inner - city children who live in public housing projects. Yet what truly makes The Interrupters the captivating, multi-layered documentary that it is is the way it conducts its subjects."
7537,"Starring Melissa Leo, Michael Parks, John Goodman, Michael Angarano, Kerry Bishe and Nicholas Braun, story finds Parks heading up a Christian cult that lures horny youngsters to their place of worship on the promise of sex with an older woman. It's impressively shot by Dave Klein and Smith shows flickers of there being a good director in the mix. From Westboro to Waco, stopping briefly for a night in a Hostel, Red State is not easily forgotten once sampled. The dialogue and film in general are clearly Smith's take on Fred Phelps and his infamous Westboro Baptist Church, but the film switches gears midway through and throws in some commentary on the Waco / Branch Davidian fiasco as well with the introduction of John Goodman as Joseph Keenan, an ATF agent poised to take out Cooper and his clan. Goodman gives the other great performance of the film as the ATF agent stuck between a rock and a hard place."
7538,"All seen in a million other comedies, most of them better than this one. What's interesting is that Hollywood writers seem to think that working mothers really give a **** about competing with a bunch of Chanel wearing housewives at a stupid school bake sale. If you're on the fence, please ignore the critics and check out this film, it will restore your faith that decent, light, truly funny, feel - good movies do get made in Hollywood. Stay awake until 3 every morning making imaginary lists in your head for things to do. It is wryly amusing and observant occasionally, but there should be lots and lots more of that, the paucity of observation and the safe boundaries means it fails to create anything other than a very safe film that is mostly trite."
7540,"This movie started out so great, it had that whole "" Jaws "" - theme going on, and it really looked like it was going to be a movie that would pay homage to the classic "" Jaws "" movies, then it all came crashing down hard and went downhill. Ever since Jaws debuted nearly 40 years ago, the flood gates for shark movies seemed to have been permanently forced open, allowing countless films to be made, most of which fail to come even close to Spielberg's classic. The 3D in the movie is really only good underwater. Like "" Piranha 3D "", which it tries to be, it opens up with someone getting killed, then opens up to an upbeat tune. What starts out as a fun filled trip soon turns into chaos as Malik (Sinqua Walls) has a rough encounter with a bull shark."
7541,"If you're smart, you know how most of the world would handle it, most people would turn into animals while the rich would benefit off the death of others. Soderbergh takes a very minimalist approach to Contagion, steering clear of anything flashy or exaggerated and avoiding over-dramatic relationships and big budget set pieces. The drama, written by Scott Z. Burns, also compares the outbreak with those of SARS, H1N1 and the Spanish flu (in 1918 that claimed 50 million lives), lending a touch of realism to the proceedings. At the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, its executive Dr Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) swings into action, sending his Epidemic Intelligence officer, Dr Erin Mears (Kate Winslet) to find out how the virus started."
7542,"Yes, he was nominated for all these performances, but in a performance like this there is something bubbling under the surface. Hill and Hoffman especially play perfect compliments to Pitt's sunny exterior. Moneyball can now join them and is among the best films of the year. The film is always intriguing, and Aaron Sorkin (whose screenplay for The Social Network was last year's best) is to be congratulated for this. However, Sorkin, as well as the director, always keeps things refreshing and interesting without becoming repetitive and stale."
7545,"Should you expect car chases, spills, thrills, gadgets galore and closely - choreographed fight scenes then you WILL be disappointed. Smiley, played inscrutably by Oldman, is tasked with uncovering the mole and is ably assisted by Guillam, the ever - watchable Cumberbatch. Admittedly this is a slow - burn of a film, full of meaningful looks, pregnant pauses and one that hints at deeper and more complex plot strands but it has an authentic air and it is a fascinating to observe a build - up of tension and cold - war paranoia which culminates in a dramatic if subdued fashion. Control tells Jim that he received important and confidential information about one of his four top spies being a mole, which would explain why the Russians have been up to date with what is going on in England. Smiley begins investigating with the help of another agent named Benedict Cumberbatch (Peter Guillam) and begins piecing things together through a series of interesting and eye - opening flashbacks."
7546,"An incident occurs that escalates into a courtroom drama but there is actually another incident or a card that Asghar Farhadi hides until it's time to show it further on in the story and the way everything progresses and eventually unravels keeps you intrigued. Asghar Farhadi's new film after the ingenious' About Elly' is running for the Golden Bear at this year's Berlin Film Festival and, with half of the competition done and the rest of the program not looking too promising, appears to be an almost inevitable winner. It is so well - crafted; the twists of the plot throw up new moral dilemmas for all the protagonists, which are explored sensitively and without judgement - so refreshingly unlike mainstream American films. The genius of Asghar Farhadi's story is that it piles on the tension and drama without resorting to fireworks, trickery or shock and awe plot effects. Asghar Farhady's obsession with the concept of judgment is once again the driving force behind his latest feature."
7547,"Events that should be important are skimmed over and not explained; to be honest, it doesn't particularly seem like anything of real importance happens in the film. Several of the dialogue - driven scenes sizzle with a sexual intensity, but when matters are actually taken to the bedroom they are hit with a dullness that would be impossible to believe came from Cronenberg if he didn't have his name stamped on it. The first act felt like punch after punch (in a good way), with very stern, rapid dialogues detailing the sexual desires of Sabina Spielrein (Knightley), a new patient of Jung's. Michael Fassbender (Jung) and Viggo Mortensen (Freud) both performed seriously and insightful and Knightley captured pretty well the behavior of a hysteric person and then, her transition through therapy. After the incredibly intense and erotic first act, featuring a scene where Jung runs a test on his wife (Sarah Gadon) that is as gripping as anything in cinema this past year, the whole thing begins to fizzle out when that tension is released and it only becomes more and more flat as it goes on."
7548,"It is perfectly logical to point out that Brendan had hard fights to get to the final and that he would probably have been exhausted and that Tommy has had a much easier route. If you are looking for great acting, family drama, awesome fighting scenes than this is the movie for you. The fact that he taps out only at the point when Brendan says he loves him is significant as is the fact that he breaks down in the corner before the final round. The fight scenes were done really well. Movies with this much emotional power connected to the characters only come around every once in a while."
7549,"The Ides of March isn't a story just about the back - alley dealings of those seeking to gain power; it's a morality tale of how much one must wrestle between doing things because he feels they are the right thing to do and doing things that will serve themselves better in the long run. Morris' campaign manager is Paul Zara, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, a veteran of many cutthroat campaigns. Like most staffers, Steven believes in Morris; he thinks that if the man is elected president, good things will happen. Indeed, Morris is handsome, smart, and appears to speak sincerely and clearly to potential voters. This is a fine film, based on a stage play, and directed by Mr. Clooney."
7550,"There are more or less subtle hints throughout the movie that not only shed some light on the bizarre ending but also keep building that disturbing mood that grows stronger and stronger as the movie progresses. This is not gore for gore's sake, this is brutal, dark and realistic violence that adds to the disturbing mood this movie sets. Thank goodness for Film4 who are showing a season of British cinema. As it transpires the work is composed of contract killings of people who are revealed to be producers of child pornography It's at this point Jay proclaims he'd happily kill these nonces free of charge and who can blame him."
7551,"All in all, a very satisfying film: lots of action, lots of very good acting, and lots of attention to detail (it really looked like it was the early 1980s). This moving picture contains thrills, unstoppable action, betrayal, fighting, car pursuits and lots of deaths, as it has a great body count: 21. The set pieces such as car chases, impressive as well as violent fights and a roof chases including bounds and leaps are all magnificent, as are so many secondary scenes."
7552,"The dialogue between the characters in "" 50/50 "" flows with tremendous ease, especially in the scenes involving Adam and Kyle. This dynamic between JGL and Rogen is the meat of the film and the two play it out brilliantly. But of course, the weight of "" 50/50 "" rests almost entirely on the shoulders of JGL and he holds up to the challenge. That's what JGL does here and that's why "" 50/50 "" succeeds. He envelopes himself into the Adam character and makes his portrayal incredibly believable."
7555,"Charismatic leads with chemistry and talent, in a love story that plays as a pitch perfect homage to vintage Hollywood features, whilst never tipping over into parody, and that's no mean feat. You'll see some familiar faces, but they all blend in well with the world of the film. He was a member of a cult comic - troop (who made sketches Ã  la SNL) but even back then, he had a little something that made him special: a voice, a smile, a charisma in both TV and movies, in both dramatic and comedic register. The direction displays such self - assurance, and treats the audience with such respect, that it is almost like having a dialogue with the director. The period detail is outstanding: film stocks, tints, (heck even the frame weave), captions and montage are all on the money."
7572,"Should everything get wrapped up nicely and leave you with a warm and fuzzy feeling when you walk out of the theater? Brandon (Michael Fassbender) is a successful and well off man living in New York City. His life is made more complex when his singer sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan), a woman with obvious problems, crashes at his place. Fassbender offers a powerful performance as a dark, sinister man with strong interplay with Mulligan as he becomes threatening towards her. Their scenes were enhanced by McQueen's direction, using hand held cameras to follows Fassbender and the conversations stick to one point, making you feel like you are really watching them in a voyeuristic matter."
7557,"It had some great comedy moments. Inevitably the robots are the stars, they're a triumph of design and visual effects and a sight for sore eyes, while Levy has a good handle on staging the fight sequences; even when cribbing from Balboa. Overall the films story maybe isn't as predictable as you'd think, and is saved from a worst rating by this, and its light sprinkiling off funny moments and cool robot designs. The move has a perfect blend of emotions, Robo - fight (very Importantly not over done) and some comic scenes, what else do you want? Have been following Huge Jackman's movies off late and all have them have been good including this one."
7558,"If you don't love them, this documentary will make you love Buck Brannaman, the inspiration for the novel The Horse Whisperer and technical adviser to Robert Redford on the film of the same name. His interaction with humans is just as successful with clinics all over the West to show owners and trainers how to tame the liveliest colts. His loving relationship with his wife and daughter, who performs at rodeos with him, is a testimony to his belief that humans are key to the happiness of the animals. The astounding 88 minute documentary "" Buck "" follows the life of a soulful and wise cowboy who runs horse training clinics around the country. 8/10 Informativeness 5/10 Cinematography 6/10 Interviews 2/10 Breadth of Info presented 9/10 Depth of Info presented 5/10 Replay Value Buck proves to be as enlightening and disarmingly satisfying a documentary as you will find."
7559,"The trailers do a good job of showing off just how great some of the dance moves are from this new cast, but what it does not let on too much is that most of these scenes come when they are replicating scenes from the original film. Her few scenes with Dennis Quaid are almost belittling and instead of the gentle correction of Vi quietly convicting Shaw Andie's Vi seemed to constantly condemn him. This is so true of this version of Footloose. A fantastic director, Craig Brewer made some of the most gritty and beautifully made dramas that involve a main character, played by an African American, that has some sort of inner conflict, as well as conflict with everyday life. Other than maybe a few good scenes involving a large production number and several dozen dancers, the film's redone music, contemporary atmosphere, updated production, and caricature - driven cast seems like an act of indolence, if anything."
7560,"The acting was consistently solid; Winstead did her part well, and the use of authentic Scandinavian actors was an added bonus. In that regard, this movie does an impressive job at tying some knots like showing how the two - faced thing came to be, as well as the origin of the dog from the start of Carpenter's Thing. Whereas the original 1982 movie was all about paranoia and the fear of the unknown - the alien hid among the human hosts, desperate to remain concealed at all costs, only showing itself when it felt its identity was compromised - it's distinctly not the case here. There are some very well designed monsters. Even though there's no mention of an American in the original, the makers shoehorn one in here, clearly unconvinced that a movie comprised entirely of Europeans would sell."
7561,"Peter Mullan and Eddie Marsan are fantastic, but then again, they always are (as an aside, does Marsan not tire of playing scumbags?) Her performance here is definitely going to propel her into the upper echelons of British acting - if she is not already there. Superb writing and gritty direction; performances better yet and Colman delivers on every level. In Tyrannosaur, the relatively young but well - established actor Paddy Considine (he's 37) directs a group of superb British thespians in a searing drama about a rageoholic widower in the town of Leeds. Basing his protagonists on unspecified but intimate experiences, and aspects of his own mother in the dead wife, Considine has written a film that's intense, brutal, and compelling."
7562,"Elizabeth Olsen does a helluva job as Martha, giving her dewey eyed complexity, both bewilderment, shock, disgust, and intrigue. But perhaps that makes the film only more intriguing â€” running away brought her to this society, and of course it looks fine on the outside, with it's acceptable living conditions and always a "" family' of sorts around you. The sex scenes were well done and messed up. There are many similarities to the Manson - family story of which much has been published, but Mr. Durkin takes the film in a much different and very creative direction by concentrating on what happens to Martha (Olsen) after she escapes the cult. In the Q&A, Durkin states he did much research and found the most fascinating story to be that of a cult escapee and what she went through during her first three weeks of freedom."
7563,"As with many psychopaths, his above average intelligence makes him even more dangerous. But first the story: Eva Khatchadourian (Tilda Swinton) is trying to piece together her life following the "" incident "". The sequencing of opening shots in most scenes allows a strong sense of atmosphere to develop even before the characters have entered the scene or dialogue has even commenced. Golden - Globe - nominated Tilda Swinton, who should have been nominated for an Oscar for this performance over even Meryl Streep, plays Eva Khatchadourian, a woman who never quite connects with her son, who becomes increasingly unstable and savage as he grows older, resulting in a high - school killing spree. Kevin, played by three young actors who look so incredibly alike, it's almost creepy, is so compelling, whether played by a toddler named Rock Duer, a child named Jasper Newell or teenage Ezra Miller, the mere presence of any incarnation of him on screen will make your skin crawl."
7564,"Â¨ The three Musketeers Â¨ is an outstanding and entertaining adaptation of the classy that will appeal to the costumer genre buffs and it results to be acceptable adaptation with big budget based on the classic This classy story is subsequently remade on several versions, as the MGM classic version in musical style by George Sidney with Gene Kelly, Paul Lukas, Gig Young, Vincent Price, Frank Morgan and Lana Turner as Milady; 1973 amusing version by Richard Lester with Michael York, Oliver Reed and Raquel Welch; 1993 modern adaptation by Stephen Herek with Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Oliver Platt and Chris O'Donnell, and 2001 rendition by Peter Hyams with Justin Chambers, Mena Suvari and Tim Roth, among others. There is a legend behind the story of the three musketeers and it stands for valor and honor, the protection of king and country and the defense of justice by fighting corruption. Alexandre Dumas's source for his novel was a book by 19th - century writer Courtils de Sandraz, which was purporting to be D'Artagnan's biography; the Musketeers were actually real people, not fictional characters created by Dumas. After a bravado skirmish with the Cardinal's guards, the young but inexperienced King Louis XIII (Freddie Fox) reinstates Athos, Aramis and Porthos to their former rank and even has D'Artagnan join them for good measure."
7565,"Amanda Seyfried submits a polished performance although her make - up makes her look like one of those Japanese animations of what a European looks like, complete with over-sized eyes. Amanda Seyfried, whose role has her playing off Timberlake for a lot of the film, is another professional whose appeal tends to overshadow her abilities for some reason. While the script is the superficial tale of Will Salas (Timberlake) and his Mom (Wilde) trying to pass time in a futuristic world, the messages of the film go far deeper. Written & directed by Andrew Niccol, the movie open up in 2169, where people are born genetically engineered with a digital clock on their forearm. Will gets the chance to move up into a better time zone thanks to a man who has just decided that after a hundred years or so, he prefers to "" time out . """
7566,"The cast boasts Anna Paquin (of True Blood fame), Hollywood heavyweight Matt Damon, Jean Reno from Leon and Matthew Broderick. Paquin gives a powerful and convincing performance throughout so you can't really blame her for the films failure. Paquin does fine, yet, at 24, she's long - in - the - tooth to be believable as a 17 year old (at first glance she appears passable as a college junior). The acting is exceptional; even relatively small parts, (played by actors such as Matthew Broderick, Matt Damon, Mark Ruffalo, and Allison Janey) showcase both the actors' own remarkable abilities as well as Lonergan's attention to detail. J. Smith Cameron and Anna Paquin, who play mother and daughter, both deliver fierce performances which form the relationship that serves as the backbone of the film."
7567,""" Carnage "" starts with a civilized discussion between two couple of parents, their kids had a fight, the little Cowan broke little Longstreet's two teeth. The performances are crucial because the point is to allow each viewer to identify with one character while the actions of the others remain justifiable. And the funniest thing is that they all try to be objective when it's totally impossible. And when the plot was getting more and more exciting, then Nancy took Alan's cell phone and threw it in the water, making the two men struggle to repair it, under the wives' mockeries. That said, though, the performances were spectacular."
7568,"A great cast with splendid performances. Even when the imminent truth reveals and the consequences are becoming more clearer, it always feels like they are cut off; there is a scene in a taxi with Quinto and Badgley that underlines this. Others may see it as more examples of greed and hubris. If you're a film buff (and enjoy great performances) or you've been in finance, this is a must - see. Bettany, Quinto, and Badgley, all turned in superb performances, but it was Tucci, Spacey, and Irons that stood out as excellent."
7569,"The Paranormal movies were made on the premise of being about a haunting of demons; adding in the "" cult "" aspect just changes things. The greatest improvement of this movie over the other movies is probably the pacing. There are also some clever shots and effects (Scenes with the oscillating camera are ingenious at times). The story is not anything new though but the execution is decent. People who also experience the occurrences, like a babysitter and a friend of Dennis, are stunned to the point of not wishing to discuss the matter further, hurriedly leaving as soon as possible."
7570,"This film began a little unfunny and was been - there - done - that with its humour, but around 15 minutes later good humour started to kick in. The title role was obviously written for Rowan Atkinson and he performs all guns blazing, tickling you to the bone. The funny scenes in this film were pretty infrequent and laugh out loud type, while the funny scenes in the first film were more chuckle type and frequent. There are many funny moments, many of which are in the trailer. It had lots of funny moments."
7571,"As an unapologetic actioner, it should be expected that Abduction possesses some of the clunky dialogue clichÃ©s associated with the genre. They are always a joy to have and see in movies. Which is why wonderful movies like "" Welcome To The Rileys "" and "" The Runaways "" both starring Kristen Stewart didn't get nearly enough attention. When looking at one website, they see a child that looks remarkably similar to Nathan."
7924,"The film is a good mixture of human examples in the real world, and researchers explaining their findings. There are two important, but opposing forces, at work in most humans. The other force is to give back to the Earth and society, to have friends, to take care of the less fortunate, to be kind to others, to do good deed, to take time to play and laugh and have fun for no reason than to simply be happy. By illustrating those who have achieved happiness as well as those who have not, the movie could potentially be very useful in helping young people make responsible and fulfilling life choices."
7573,"The dialogues were funny and awkward, the music was pretty fresh and the cast was great, and Faris was surprisingly good in this one. This movie isn't about "" fairy - tale love "" and finding "" Mr. Perfect "" but about finding who you are and someone who accepts you as you are and THAT is perfect. Not the classic perfect catch man of these type of movies, which is breath of fresh air. Tuck in the always reliable Blythe Danner and Ed Begley, Jr and this is a cast worth an evening's outing. Chris Evans, Blythe Danner, and Ed Begley Jr. make up the fine supporting cast."
7574,"This is most probably why Jo NesbÃ¸'s first movie adaption of his series of novels with Harry Hole will be directed by Martin Scorsese, on NesbÃ¸'s demand - his favorite director. SynnÃ¸ve Macody Lund who play Roger's wife Diana is beautifully good too. Such is the premise of "" Headhunters, "" a terrific Norwegian film that follows up its run at the 55th San Francisco International Film Festival with a general release. Probably both to the novel writers Jo NesbÃ¸'s for the latter years has become world acclaimed and compared to Stieg Larsson, buy maybe also due to director Morten Tyldums merits so far. Well, here Morten Tyldum (Acclaimed films as "" Buddy "" and a short in "" Most people usually live in China ""), succeeded in making a film just as interesting and exciting as the book."
7575,"Despite running barely over 60 minutes, the movie does a wonderful job of getting to the point of how both Wayne and Gordon struggle to keep their beliefs in a world devoid of morality. If anything, this film allows those who would normally be averse to reading a comic book appreciate a timeless tale, integral to Batman lore. The animation by Korean studio "" Moi Animation "" is so smooth and seamless, a standard usually only seen in big budget theatrical feature films along the lines of "" Rebuild of Evangelion "" and "" Sky Crawlers "". When it first debuted in 1987, Batman Year One was meant to be a realistic reinterpretation of Batman's origins. Besides inspiring elements in various Batman animated shows since the 1990s, Batman Year One is also the main inspiration for the blockbuster hit "" Batman Begins ""."
7576,"Puss learns that two murderous outlaws, Jack and Jill have the magic beans he's been looking for half his life, which lead to a giant's castle holding valuable golden goose eggs. Puss then meets his old childhood friend Humpty Dumpty, who introduces another cat as Kitty Softpaws, one of the best cat thieves in the world. After Humpty explains to Puss that he wants a second chance, Puss agrees to help him obtain the beans, making it clear that he is doing it for the town and his mother and to win back the respect he once had. Kitty Softpaws was very nicely voiced by Selma, her character was a lot of fun and for an animated movie had great chemistry with Puss. The animation was still great as usual, seeing it in 3D added the dimension and looked very nice, though the 3D is really not needed for this one."
7577,"The chemistry between Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy is very good too and they both provide a couple of very memorable scenes. One other attraction with Tower Heist is it's confluence of top stars such as Eddie Murphy, Ben Stiller, Casey Affleck and Tea Leoni. Eddie Murphy's character was an over-the-top funny type of guy and Ben Stiller had his moments of over-the-top humor too. Alan Alda makes for a good slimy villain, and Ben Stiller, Eddie Murphy, and Matthew Broderick (as well as their co-stars) make a likable bunch of people with a goal that you hope they will be able to reach. But, very few are actually smart and slick enough like an' Italian Job' or an' Oceans Eleven'."
7578,"Leonardo DiCaprio is superb (as usual) in the title role, never revealing more cards then he chooses to at any given moment. Her commitment to Hoover knew no bounds. The make up must also be praised for allowing DiCaprio to portrayal Hoover in many different stages of his life. Leo probably should have won for playing Howard Hughes, but maybe he'll win for playing J. Edgar. Leonardo DiCaprio is another great reason to watch the film, in one of the most moving performances in his career."
7579,"Yes, occasionally he shows up in a fairly good movie like Hachiko or Unfaithful, but then the superior performances are from other actors (Diane Lane, in that particular case). Topher Grace as the (supposedly brilliant) rookie FBI Agent is seriously miscast, while Richard Gere needs to ditch the action genre. So - yes - it was an interesting way of bringing back a sort of Cold War theme to a movie made more than 20 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union. On top of the great casting of the leads, you also have Martin Sheen being as dignified as ever and Odette Yustman having a smaller, but important role."
7597,"Daldry also gets an excellent performance from von Sydow - with wordless shrugs and sighs, he effortlessly conveys his character's troubled past, one so traumatising that he has chosen to remain silent and relate to others with a simple' yes' on one palm and' no' on the other. A fair warning before you step into this 9/11 drama based on the acclaimed novel by Johnathan Safran Foer - the protagonist, a nine - year - old boy living in New York City, isn't someone you'll embrace easily, even though the fact that he had lost his father in the Twin Towers should win much sympathy. This movie probably features both Tom Hanks' and Sandra Bullock's best performance of the past years and Max von Sydow, who never says a word in this movie, even got nominated for an Oscar for his role in this movie. Does he have big beautiful eyes. He was very moving in everything he did!"
7580,"He is brave, always gets out of the tangles he gets in, he is a good guy, he doesn't know doubts. It is actually the reason for the appearance of Captain Haddock after a few albums. But in the end you have a movie that can be appreciated both by fans of the comics as well as people who have "" just heard about them "". There are scenes of fights and chases which are so creative and so imaginative, the way he uses angles and the way everything links on is a real joy to watch. Since 1981, Spielberg has become an avid fan of this gorgeous "" Tintin "" comics and has been longing to create a film about it."
7581,"There is plenty of information during the first part about the Beatles and their early years in the red light district of Berlin at the start of the 60's, the overwhelming success of the band, and the creative tensions that eventually led to the split. The second part of the film looks in detail at Harrison's fascination with Indian mysticism and spirituality, and the religious and spiritual transformation which would consume him in later years and shape much of his direction. What emerges is a picture of a self - effacing man, a consummate professional who approached everything he did with passion. The film is bursting with unseen footage & audio, and there is no narrator reporting statistics or time lost dwelling on lawsuits or coincidence. Scorsese draws upon a wealth of photographs, rarely seen archival footage, home videos, diary entries, and interviews to round out this picture of a gentle, humble, artistic man eternally searching for inner peace."
7582,"The family crowds will probably enjoy it, but younger children will likely be put off by it's slow pacing and lack of excitement. The movie incorporates a loose interpretation of the life of Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s, a stage magician and an early innovator in world of cinema who realized the potential for the new medium of storytelling. At a time when most "" movies "" were just real - world situations recorded to celluloid (such as the famous train pulling into the station), MÃ©liÃ¨s created fantastic stories and mythical tales to entertain, filling his films with special effects and dramatic costuming. Ben Kingsley is Papa Georges (MÃ©liÃ¨s) and, in the film, he is a defeated man who mourns the death of his legacy following World War I. Kingsley is perfect here and the highlight of the movie. The way movies are made, the different layers of audio, visuals, emotions, symbols, the photography, the standout supporting casts, the way you can predict the clichÃ© moves sometimes, but love it anyway."
7583,"The premise of Trespass is simple: Nic Cage plays a diamond dealer who lives in a beautiful house with his wife and daughter, and some thugs break into the house one day to steal his stash. What makes this movie interesting is the performances. Cage taps into his subtlety - something he rarely does these days - which helps the tension and uneasiness of the atmosphere build until he finally bursts (on more than one occasion). Some of the reveals are a pleasant surprise, others leave you scratching your head. The best thing you can do is grab some popcorn, turn off your brain and watch the events unravel before your eyes."
7584,"Gods loved to "" play around "" with people. All in all, the makers just used some "" famous "" names from the Greek mythology and created a lot of violent fights in an attempt to gain the attention of the viewers. "" The fight with the Greek Gods was very well done, although many people may disagree (more on that in the next paragraph). Well done fight scenes, stylized blood, gorgeous Frieda Pinto and Gods. They took the 3D to their advantage with the blood splatter and the stabbings and honestly, it was fun to watch."
7585,What Jack and Jill is really all about is Sandler's effort to exact revenge against moviegoers. Funny People and Just Go With It were awesome movies!
7586,"Searching for a meaning and a purpose in this new life he finds little in his friends' bourgeois city routines, which he neither desires nor feels he could achieve anyway, and their claims that "" it'll all get better "" fail to move a mind constantly probing and analysing the reality of his situation. The movie happens to have some similar basic elements here and there, as well as different encounters for the main character played this time out by Anders Danielsen Lie who was also happened to be one of the leads in Reprise who this time around plays a wonderful role on his own. Anders Danielsen Lei gives a very impressive performance as a once - promising writer whose life got derailed by substance abuse. There is an incredibly poignant scene where he sits in a cafÃ© observing the world passing him by, various conversations flutter in and out of audibility but most of what they are talking about relates to him in some way. Oslo, August 31st is an exquisite film that really does show how the world will pass you by no matter who you are or what your problems are."
7596,"Despite being a comedy movie with a lot of chaos as practically everything goes wrong when Noah Griffith takes the kids he's babysitting on a road trip to get some drugs for his' girlfriend' this movie shows a lot of character growth and has a very good' moral' behind it. The Sitter tries to emulate the formula of many recent successful comedies in terms of witty one - liners and clever trade - offs between characters, occasionally seasoned with a bit of more physical comedy. Being an eternal child at heart, Jonah's connection to his ward's problems feels perfectly natural and, in certain ways, touching to a degree. The whole film moves at an increasingly agonizing pace at it becomes more and more clear that you're actually waiting for something funny to happen. It also knows how to pick a lovable lead actor who is consistently funny in everything he does."
7587,"This is a movie that runs the gamut of emotions, with pristine sincerity, grace, dignity, and rich realism. The tremendous amount of pressure under which Matt finds himself is exacerbated by his daughters' behavior; partly their reaction to their mother's plight but also because, well, they're precocious and self - absorbed, as most kids are when they're teens or preteens. However, director Alexander Payne does an amazing job of keeping everything level. Life has its terrible moments and its joyous ones, too, and this film emulates that layer of authenticity to really deliver an emotionally powerful, provocative, and endearing story. Seven years later, he finally returns, and with The Descendants, he returns with a bang."
7588,"Jason Segel and Amy Adams are perfectly corny in this, but it works here, because it's the muppets! Jason Segel, along with co-writer Nicholas Stoller and director James Bobin have made a film that is just absolutely bursting at the seams with affection towards the Muppets, and that love and passion has instantly rocketed this movie to the very top of the list when it comes to long history of Muppet shows, movies, and even viral videos. Jason Segal so utterly dominates the film that the Muppets themselves are reduced to mere cameo performances in the film. Jason Segel with his obvious and undying love for the Muppets is, by all accounts, the most deserving person to be given creative control of the Muppets since Jim Henson himself. The Muppets may quite possibly be one of the best movies of 2011."
7589,"New Moon introduced the werewolves and Volturi, which added new mystery and suspense. Breaking Dawn Part 1 thankfully takes its time with (most of) the important moments from the book. Billy Burke and Sarah Clarke as Bella's parents get some great moments, both emotional and humorous. But the arrival of their remarkable daughter, Renesmee, sets in motion a perilous chain of events that pits the Cullens and their allies against the Volturi, the fearsome council of vampire leaders, setting the stage for an all - out battle. Some Cullens who aren't Edward get a bit more dialogue than usual (Elizabeth Reaser as Esme is probably the most happy about this)."
7590,"It is well understood from the first few scenes that the typical clichÃ© of both war films and animal dramas will stain Spielberg's canvas, yet the film pushes forward, earning well - deserved praise. The battle scenes are detailed and exciting. The usual bloodbath and gory murder scenes are ditched in favour of a genuine story that manages to provoke passion and deep emotion in the audience, and overall this fits into the beauty of the narrative. The Critics of Hollywood must owe these guys Money or something, for giving it such good reviews. The performances of the horses in this movie are impressive."
7591,"His writing can repel and enchant with equal measure and has a breakneck spontaneity which is rivaled by its frazzled incoherency. The film is defiantly worth watching in terms of its originality as well as the comical moments and strong storyline. With his new job comes new friendships, utter absurdity, vast amounts of alcohol all topped off with a blonde bombshell. Watching "" The Rum Diary "" was like talking to a drunk grad student; little flashes of genius may linger but after what seems like four hours you realize you're talking to a drunken idiot and looking for the door. The epilogue appears while Johnny Depp sails into the horizon explaining that while its the end of the story ""."
7592,"The vulnerability, the mannerisms, the voice - all were pitch perfect. The movie is similar in tone to "" The King's Speech, "" and was helped by a beautiful score and wonderful costumes. Director Simon Curtis, who devoted eight years of his life to this project, did a wonderful job capturing the essence of 1950's England. Judi Dench is a hoot as Dame Sibyl Thorndike and Kenneth Brannagh has his moments. Her gritty indie acting is terrific and she works hard to get the emotions and make a real character."
7593,"Weekend catches the little moments of life beautifully and it finds beauty in the everyday. It's all there in tiny details, there is never a moment when you don't utterly believe what goes on in his heart, it's all there in his eyes and the most subtle shifts of expression. Agree with other postings that this film is one of the best gay films. There are some wonderful scenes cinematically as well. This must have been nerve - wracking for both of them and yet they handle these scenes with restraint and with believable ardor."
7598,"The film opens with a bravura set piece showing how Santa is able to stop in millions of homes in one night. There have been many movies over the years where Christmas must be saved from disaster, but Arthur Christmas has a very creative take on it. Produced by Aardman Animations in association with Sony Pictures Animation, this CGI animated film delivers Aardman's distinct brand of quirky humor and style. The character designs are asymmetric and the surface textures are realistic yet bold. Sometimes celebrity voice talent backfires, but here it works beautifully, the English accents lending a sense of gravity that heightens the silliness."
7599,"It starts out seeming to be a black comedy about teenage girl hired killers, but as it develops it eventually morphs into a poignant story. Other motifs that echo and exaggerate Tarantino's style include the implausible violence sequences that can only exist in some alternate film universe (think Black Mamba single - handedly wiping out a small army of yakuza in "" Kill Bill, "") and the interminable gabfest that fills out a QT script (these people love to talk and talk and talk). Geoffrey Fletcher, the Academy Award winner for Best Screenplay for Precious: Based on the Novel "" Push "" by Sapphire directs this violent yet touching film starring Saoirse Ronan, Alexis Bledel and James Gondolfini. The heroines of the film are wonderfully played by Saoirse Ronan and Alexis Bledel. Violet & Daisy is an excellent movie with some unique ideas, charismatic heroines (well played: Saoirse Ronan & Alexis Bledel), and a pro production and side cast."
7606,"The bullet - time was used to convey how traumatic a couple of scenes were to someone with that type of awareness, and it worked beautifully. The film is a visual stunner, easily with "" The Tree of Life "" and "" HP VII / Part II "", one of the best looking movies ever filmed. Doyle's Holmes and Watson are truly two of the most intelligent and fascinating characters in literature; as a pair, they might have no match, and Moriarty is the perfect villain, but the way these films treat the development of the story and the characters themselves is a shame, for Ritchie prefers to have slow motion takes to show bullets or flash editing to detract from the impact of a good action scene. It is a cat and mouse chase through some lovely scenery and it ends with the ultimate solution, the final solution, a chess move so diabolical, the audiences gasp, and in what could have an amazing cliffhanger, with a true open end, or not, depending on how carefully you have reviewed the clues along the way, Ritchie goes the easy away. Rapace is truly wasted, and it is hard to believe she gave the best performance of the year in 2010."
7609,"Without an iota of irony, Charlize Theron finally uses her intimidating beauty for pure Machiavellian evil, and the results are fortuitous in this dark - hued 2011 comedy, the latest collaboration of director Jason Reitman and screenwriter Diablo Cody ("" Juno ""). She's absolutely spot - on terrific playing Mavis Gary, the condescending, hateful high school girl who comes back to Mercury, her podunk hometown nearly two decades later. Normally, this would be an excuse for broad comedy machinations, but Theron is so gorgeous that it makes her shameless attempts at seduction all the more edgily desperate. That Mavis and Matt connect is all the more intriguing since they were at opposite ends of the social spectrum back in school, and their present - day bond is also fueled by her obvious alcoholism, a point that is overlooked by her befuddled parents who wish to think of Mavis as the flawless pretty daughter of their own deluded fantasies. Beyond Theron's fearless work and intentionally deadpan line delivery, there is comedian Patton Oswalt's surprisingly affecting performance as Matt."
7610,"After his last holiday - themed box - office smash Valentine's Day in 2010, director Garry Marshall has carbon - copied the exact same formula for his latest film New Year's Eve which uses its gigantic ensemble cast to document various different relationships and states of emotions over the course of a single day and night in New York City. The film also has some bizarre cast members, including the incredibly pointless Jon Bon Jovi who slinks about, and may as well be promoting a new Greatest Hits album when he enters the frame. Performers like De Niro are worthy of a solid script and something more important to do rather than just stand around holding a theoretical sign saying' And Robert De Niro'."
7611,"It has a good mixture of interesting action scenes, suspense, drama, humor, great scenery of Venice, Italy, and fine acting. He's a fantastic actor who doesn't even chose to have a stunt double in MI4. But with every new part of the series it gets even more spectacular: the equipment is beyond imagination, the locations are mind blowing, the secret plans are super clever, the characters are cool and smart. The best action film in years. He is complimented by a very well - cast team of agents."
7612,"Their beautiful and natural moments on screen are as breath taking as they are tear - jerking. The wild cast of supporting actors includes wise - cracking Thomas Haden Church as Benjamin's brother, JB Smoove as the Realtor, Peter Riegert as Mee's editor, Patrick Fugit (from Almost Famous) as the guy with a monkey on his shoulder, Angus Macfadyen as the colorful zoo maintenance man, and John Michael Higgins as the snooty zoo inspector who knowingly holds their future in his smarmy hand. The story of a grieving widower who makes the unusual decision to buy a rural property whose 18 acres includes the Rosemoor Animal Park, it is also Crowe's first feature since his 2005 flop' Elizabethtown' and the feel - good family movie represents a welcome return to form for the talented filmmaker behind such classics like' Say Anything' and' Jerry Maguire'."
7613,"Getting her big break in the underrated remake of "" A Nightmare on Elm Street "" and later starring in Fincher's previous film "" The Social Network "" (giving a dynamite performance in the opening scene), Mara has sealed her future with many more promising and exciting roles because of her portrayal of Lisbeth. The nudity in the Swedish version is tasteful, this film is anything but tasteful. Of note in the supporting characters are Yorick van Wageningen who plays the sadistic Bjurman with unsettling believability and the always great Christopher plummer who is note - perfect as the desperate, loney grandfather Henrik. With the amount of screen time she has, Robin Wright is also very good as Blomkvist's business partner Erika Berger. Whether its sweeping shots of freezing, snow covered Sweden or wonderfully eerie interiors Fincher creates an unsettling atmosphere that is unrelenting and technically perfect."
7614,"Hasn't been a box office hit or getting much in the way of good reviews, but if basic alien invasion is your cup of tea, you will probably enjoy it too. It is sad to hear the clichÃ¨d excuse for their invasion, but they are very interesting to see. Overall, this is far from a great film but it is a fun straight - forward B - movie with some welcome flashes of originality. The floor of light bulbs effects, used similarly to the motion detectors in the Aliens movie, was cool. Aliens have attacked and slaughtered most humans alive."
7615,"the film was more of a dark comedy, very funny and laugh out loud moments involving religion, relationships and even murder. His journey is the heart of the film and the center of most of the comedic moments. A good pick for fans of dark comedies. the Characters and acting were the best thing in the movie, a wonderful cast lead by Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Ed Harris, Jennifer Connely and Marisa TOmey. Overall, a decent dark comedy that is worth watching but tone down your expectations."
7616,"The comedic talents of Chris O'Dowd are wasted which is a shame because he could have brought a lot more to the film. One area Friends With Kids absolutely wins at is its ability to have believable, real - life conversations that are projected through a mature, human scope. These are the scenes that create great humanity and drama between the characters, in an non-contrived, believable manner. It's charming, often quite poignant, and perhaps offers some keen insights about the idea of raising children that is often forgone in many modern romantic comedies. Nevertheless, Westfeldt, Adam Scott, Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Chris O'Dowd and Jon Hamm (Westfeldt's romantic partner in real life) bring sincere performances, and they are the main reason why this film is worthy of a slight recommendation."
7617,"The super-sweet story of Kevin Clash, the puppeteer behind Elmo and a variety of other characters, which doubles as a heartwarming look back at the attitudes and atmosphere behind the scenes with Jim Henson's troupe in the glory days. The amount of work that went obtaining rare footage of Jim Henson interviews, old television shows, and Kevin Clash's audition tapes, as well as the way in which the creative team re-created memories where footage does not exist, makes every last moment as visually relevant and exciting as Kevin's story is touching and fascinating. It is a cinematic adventure that takes you through Kevin's journey and introduces you to a world of puppeteers who live and breathe to create childhood magic. Kevin Clash's journey from a quiet kid with an unusual passion, to one of the most legendary and well - respected puppeteers in the world, is downright inspirational. It is sad that of the 15 documentaries currently nominated for the 2012 Oscars this wasn't one of them - it clearly deserves to be - it may not be about great injustices or uncovering the new, but it does something that the very best documentaries can do - it makes the world a a better place and the viewer a better person for watching it."
7619,"The charismatic Harry Connick Jr. gives a stellar performance, providing Sawyer with a role model. The movie is inspirational for a reason; therefore, it's usually telling a story of someone making the best out of a bad situation. Cozi Zuehlsdorf makes her acting debut as Hazel Haskett, Sawyer's best friend. The family relationships between Ashley Judd and Nathan Gamble (mother & son) and then Gamble and Austin Stowell (1st cousins) and then Stowell and his parents Kim Ostrenko (Judd's sister) and Jim Fitzpatrick (Judd's brother in law & Stowell's father) and then Gamble and Winter the Dolphin and then Winter and Gamble and Cozi Zuehlsdorff (Gamble's new best friend) and her dad Harry Connick Jr (Marine Biologist) and then Connick and his dad Kris Kristofferson. Freeman gives credence to Dr. McCarthy and, thanks to him not being in the right frame of mind, his dedication to creating a new tail for Winter."
7620,"This film had so much potential to open peoples eyes to one of the most influential politicians of the time and all it does is focus on an elderly persons slide into dementia. There were so many highly charged / globally reported moments and periods throughout her prime minister - ship which were just brushed over or completely skipped - the poll tax (which attracts about 5 mins of the film), the miners strikes (less than 5 minutes), the Iranian embassy siege (no mention of at all), the Falklands war (maybe 15 minutes but deserved so much more), the policy of privatisations (minimal), and crucially the impact her leadership had on the country (nothing). The scenes which recount her path from young adulthood through to local politics and then to her 11 years of turbulent leadership are intriguing, however they are too far and few between to really grip. The nearest the film gets to real depth, politically - speaking, is when it devotes fifteen whole minutes of precious screen time to the Falklands War."
7621,"Filmed with a great eye for scenery on the breathtaking coast of the Isle of Man by director of photography Jan Jonaeus, the narrative takes in the kids on the beaches, the family in the guest house and most notably Emelia and new friend Beth. The cast are all excellent, Sebastan Koch all guilty nervous ticks, Julia Ormond neglected, spiteful and probably the saddest character in the story. But Felicity Jones and Jessica Brown Findlay carry the weight of the film and are believable opposites, angel and devil, bookworm and loose cannon. Brown Findlay particularly shines with comic delivery of vicious put - downs but also scenes of more hefty emotional weight. See it for the scenery, the performances and for the drama."
7623,"An airplane loaded with roughneck oilmen crashes in Alaska and the survivors trek through a snow storm to survive while a pack of wolves kill them off one by one. Those who loved it saw a competently directed action horror film in a realistic setting filled with real people facing real threats. In the '70s, they were natural animals like sharks, killer whales, reptiles, furry animals and insects. If you want to see good acting in a scenic backdrop with lots of scary moments, you will like this movie. Like so many Ridley Scott movies, this one is also a meditation on the nature of fate."
7625,"But this film kept the action grounded in the physical capabilities of its very capable star, and that made it anything but boring. Sharp, uncomplicated, and thrilling,' Haywire' packs its punches quite effectively. The list of talented male actors involved is endless - Tatum, McGregor, Douglas, Banderas, Fassbender, Paxton. It has a lot of twists and turns in the plot, but none too obvious and too script convenient. It's good to see a tough female action character, and knowing what she can do in real life mixed martial art battles makes her character even more convincing."
7627,"What this singular piece of nastiness has going for it in the main is brevity, no film of 88 minutes really ever outstays its welcome."
7629,"Cage makes a credible work in the leading role, and he is well complemented by the solid performances from January Jones and Guy Pearce. His career is always interesting, even if his films aren't - he seems to make, in equal measure (although not necessarily consecutively) critically acclaimed art - house movies, multiplex crowd pleasers, and utter clunkers. One night, Laura leaves the rehearsal in a theater and is assaulted and beat up by a rapist while Will is playing chess with his friend Jimmy (Harold Perrineau). Nicholas Cage has participated in ambivalent movies, but this one is definitely among the better ones."
7630,"It's an admittedly smart movie, as was Part II (which was basically Hostel with a female cast), that showed how ignorance and gullibility can lead to serious consequences. Hostel: Part III is radically different from the first two though. They have tangible chemistry and oddly enough the most amusing scene in the movie is when they're all together in a casino just hanging out being dudes. It's a lot of fun and a pleasant change of pace from the downbeat final acts of the first two Hostels. The first two Hostel movies felt very raw and unedited."
7633,"The reason of this choice is smoothly handled by the script: the film starts with all the job applicants, every one of them unnaturally posing and getting mixed in prepared answers. If you want to watch and enjoyable comedy, with very touching moments, this is a must go. Some movies can work with a good story but they need good performances, in "" Untouchable "", it's almost impossible to determine who carried the film, both Cluzet and Sy were great. Sy's comic timing will have you in stitches, but it is his honesty and vulnerability that make you fall in love with the character. There are real people in "" Untouchable "", nothing works as plot devices even if some situations are so cinematically appealing: Omar inviting everybody to dance during Paul's birthday, his learning of the aristocratic world, the art of abstract painting, and the way he breaks the conventions with an unconventional charisma reaches a level of energetic comedy that reminds of the greatest days of Eddie Murphy, with Cluzet as a perfect straight - man not deprived from a sense of humor."
7635,"Those movies took their sweet time building the most delicious atmosphere and tension. What a waste - because when the horror does finally come, those scenes are actually pretty good. This automatically alienates a good portion of the horror faithful, especially in the younger echelons, for those who need and seek thrill after thrill, a ghost train ride of a horror movie, The Innkeepers is sure to be a hard slog to get through. But for a certain niche in horrorville, where the adults reside who love a sombre tone, character and story build up and a last quarter pay off, then The Innkeepers is a little gem of a creeper."
7638,"It triggers different actions and revelations in his life that are irreversible, as is often the case with love in real life too. (personal rant ahead) The world of today is all about extroverts, people who are eloquent and sociable, certainly not something George can boast about. If you do enjoy this movie, don't forget to take a look at:' 500 days of Summer' and' It's kind of a funny story', which both are pretty close in terms of atmosphere to this one. Here is a short summary of the movie George played by Freddie Highmore, is a senior in high school who narrates throughout the movie, is does not do his homework or listen in class instead he draws sketches and doodles. Great artistic drama with some comedy scenes that will make you laugh, because they remind you of when you were young and in school."
7651,"It has the same quasi-serious, cartoony - horror vibe as the first film, with glimpses of humor. But if you're really stoned or just want to see cool sh*t on screen for an hour and a half and there's literally nothing else to watch, go ahead and knock yourself out with Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance. Cage, who is a fan of comics in real life, is well - cast as Blaze, and captures the character's conflicting emotions with expert ease. Ghost Rider looks badass, the visuals in the big set pieces are nice to look at, and if you have no interest in the story you can definitely shut your brain off and enjoy the insanity happening on screen. You can't really blame any actors here because it's obvious the filmmakers wanted it to be a massive CGI-fest with stupid dialogue to lead action sequence A to action sequence B. To their credit, the CGI in this movie is pretty cool."
7644,"It is good to see people do positive things to challenge piracy, rather than threatening the parents of a 13 year old girl with jail because she downloaded a Justin Bieber song on their internet connection. Probably the weakest part is the environment chunk, but even that has some good bits."
7648,"The conclusion will be to start taste the joy, hear the colors and see the sun. Then, all that matters is how these two characters cope with an epidemic that bursts, depriving people their senses. Perfect Sense turns out to be a flavor - rich drama with absorbing performances from the lead pair Ewan McGregor & Eva Green. The cast's performances are not only authentic, they are illuminating; particularly Ewan McGregor's and Eva Green's central couple."
7649,"It is full of effecting moments and feelings. They have mixed so many funny scenes and stories in that the audience is possessed, but not crying. Kokowaah follows in the fame of the previous Til Schwiger's films and as well as it's predecessors, it also keeps the bar pretty high. The well - balanced mix of romance, fun, emotions on the background of a serious topic makes Kokowaah be a movie one really enjoys, thinks about and won't forget. The points that Kokowaah might loses at some moments are "" replenished "" again with its brilliant soundtrack and score, which is worth buying, the more due to it's well - done digipack."
7655,"All of the actors (except for a couple of the smaller characters) gave exceptional performances. The acting was wonderful, not only from the familiar faces but also from the newcomers to the big screen. The entire cast acted as if that was ACTUALLY their story they were telling and it really made the performances shine through. A coming of age road trip filled with laughter, soul searching and twists that will leave you cheering for all the best things in others and, in the end, you may even find out a little something about yourself. This is a feel good movie that despite being preachy never feels like if the directors are trying to force their faith on the viewers."
7657,"The film does have some action scenes involving gang violence, arrests and shootouts. This highly entertaining film is about the struggles of fatherhood. And that leads to strong mothers, and then stronger children. As part of this the story was made more believable by some revelations mid-way through the movie about some of the characters that showed their less than perfect lives and values. The movie is a nice surprise in a season of movies that will probably be forgotten a few weeks after viewing."
7660,"It's a simple film about hobbies and how they can affect your life, as well as being what all films essentially are; a story to entertain you for an hour and a half. That was probably the funniest moment in the entire film. Thankfully though, there is enough scientific meat, nice scenery and decent performances from the others to pull it off. Overall, Big Year is a funny and heart - warming movie that will make you think about your own priorities and dreams. Steve Martin gives a beautifully balanced performance as an aging business owner who has always dreamed of trying for the Big Year birding record."
7662,"Quite possibly the most iconic was the professional and motivating Herm Edwards sending a message to his players saying, "" you play to win the game "" after Herm's New York Jets lost to the Cleveland Browns in 2002. They figure that since they're at rock bottom, they can only go up from there, and Bill Courtney plans to turn the team around, putting heavy emphasis on character and frequently telling them, "" character is not how you handle successes, because anyone can bask in the glory of a win, but how you handle failures, "" and that is a bold and admirable message for an unpaid coach to tell his players. Thankfully, Courtney has a reliable lineup, involving O. C. Brown, a senior whose passion is more suited for the field than the classroom, the quick and dependable Montrail "" Money "" Brown, and a man by the name of Chavis Daniels, who is the team goon, often causing trouble and possessing a very suspicious anger problem. There's a touching scene in the latter half when O. C. and Courtney are traveling somewhere in a car together when O. C. tells the coach that he is attracted to another girl. The film chronicles the 2009 season, showing modest beginnings, but a wonderfully unbelievable conclusion with opportunities soaring for the team, players, and school."
7665,"He is amiable and has a good heart, but his girlfriend ValÃ©rie is ready to dump him because of his aimlessness. From such an inauspicious beginning, what unfolds is actually a heartwarming story of David Wozniak (Patrick Huard), a middle - aged man whose life of non-commitment changes radically when he discovers that he had actually fathered more than 500 kids via his multiple sperm donations done when he was a young man. It's also very character driven and there are a ton of lovely moments that make you love the characters as they struggle to make decisions. All the children were conceived thanks to his donations to the fertility clinic, registered under' Starbuck' - and it's twenty years later - 142 of the kids want to know his identity. Because of a screw - up at a fertility clinic, he is actually the biological father of hundreds of children."
7666,"Eating a diet of whole food, low fat, plant based foods, will keep you healthy. If possible, go for one of the pre-screenings or see it later in a cinema near you. In a nutshell, "" Forks Over Knives "" can be interpreted as "" Eat A Great Diet In Order To Avoid Surgery . "" It is far more than filling emotional voids, it is your health and your medicine. Lee Fulkerson's "" Forks Over Knives "" makes the case that simply switching from an animal - based diet to a plant - based one is the best thing that one can do not only for himself but also for the planet."
7667,"Granted it may not clean up at the Oscars, but the story of a guy who really has no idea where he belongs is both hilariously and sweetly told in Goon, with a great relationship conveyed between Doug and his friend - excellently played by Baruchel - who seems to be the only one who believes in him. Written by Jay Baruchel (also starring) and Evan Goldberg (the man to thank for' Superbad' &' Pineapple Express'), the words come to life on screen and audiences should delight in some incredibly amusing one - liners (watch out for the foul - mouthed Baruchel) but also be engaged in the kind hearted and naive Sean William - Scott. Glatt's main objective is to destroy and take out the other players, and everyone around him is constantly stressing that. There is a fairly good following but there are still a lot of people who don't realise that fighting is part of the game and that' Goons' actually do play the game. His soon to be ex hero, Ross Rhea is also good with his fists and a is a famous on pitch trouble maker."
7670,"In its own subtle way, the movie questions many of the basic premises that underlie modern society. It is "" the best day in the history of the whole world "" â€“ a quote pulled from brothers and main characters Jeff (Jason Segel) and Pat's (Ed Helms) deceased father in a dream. Jeff becomes obsessed for his signs of something greater after watching the alien invasion film "" Signs "" starring Mel Gibson, Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin. After that, the actors were free to improvise and play - out the scenes with each other. This is something that is admirable and most people secretly wish that they could do according to film makers."
7673,"King of the B's Cannes favourite' Corman's World' is a heart - warming portrait of one of the true greats of American independent cinema, the champion of outlaws, freaks and fools and the master of the macabre. What's more astonishing is the dazzlingly array of aspiring filmmakers and actors he mentored during the 60's and 70's. Reading like a Who's Who's of the golden age of the American auteur, Peter Bogdanovich, Peter Fonda, Martin Scorsese, Jonathan Demme, Ron Howard, Robert De Niro and David Carradine, amongst many others, all pay tribute here, including a tearful Jack Nicholson. Beginning in the 50's as a story analyst at 20th Century Fox, Corman moved into writing, eventually selling scripts to fund his own productions for the burgeoning American Independent Pictures. Corman really made his mark in the 60's."
7674,"Jiro is not an easy celebration of sushi - it is certainly not simply stunning shots of food on plates - it is rather a more difficult and even challenging film about the complex nature of obsession, perfection, and the discipline and almost OCD behavior that it takes to become the world's best. Jiro is acknowledged as the world's best - his restaurant in a pass in an underground station in Tokyo sits 9 people at a time, has to be booked at least a month in advance, and costs the best part of a week's wages. Many shots are based on the golden mean, and placed exactly two - thirds to the right of frame - and there is throughout a sense of real thought and balance. It is certainly one of the best documentaries of 2012. David Gelb's meticulously produced 2012 documentary tells the story of Jiro Ono, an octogenarian perfectionist whose constant striving for culinary transcendence has made him legendary among epicureans in the know."
7678,"The action is a mix of shootouts, hand to hand weapons, and mostly good ol' fashioned fists. Story wise it isn't anything great but at the same time it's better than most martial arts films due to interesting twists and being incredibly well paced to before you know it its over and you want more. Fantastic martial art movements, which is traditional martial art called Pencak Silat from Indonesia truly filled this movie with wowing watcher's experience. The best part of Iko was when He's about to face several people alone in a hallway. The Raid gives fair proportion to fighters in this movie."
7680,"In between the action and the comedy, Joel Murray's character delivers scathing indictments of society that had the Toronto audience break out into spontaneous applause."
7686,"The Phelps family seem like the perfect subject for Louis Theroux since his mode of operation generally is to go into odd or extreme groups (families, hobbies, jobs etc) and chat with the people in an innocent - abroad type way. The only good bit is also a repeat of last time, where Louis chats with the 18 - year old Grace, which is a repeat of when he did get good material from a couple of the teenage girls. As for the likes of Steve, wow! The first documentary Louis Theroux made about the infamous Phelps family was terrifically well made and is the best film about these nasty cult members."
7687,"It was like a great and funny and cleansing session at a cinema / therapist, that just washed over you, so touching were all the emotions and insights, so real to life, you could not believe they were acting. Why does the extended family work perfectly well in countries like Italy, Spain, Greece, India, but is a rarity here? But fortunately The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a charmer and even the youngest viewers will find something to enjoy here. Dev Patel's Sonny runs the place under the watchful eye of his disapproving mother and the visitors are left to dust off the furniture and make do with the cockroaches on the floors and the curry served up every dinnertime. The stars of the movie are delightful; Judi Dench does vulnerable but determined; Bill Nighy funny and heartbreaking; and Tom Wilkinson quiet, reserved and struggling with an unexpected burden."
7694,"This is compelling in and of itself, but as part of "" 96 Minutes, "" it's just filler material. Like another film CRASH, 96 MINUTES tackles the subject of race, gangs, and inner - city lifestyles. The performance by Evan Ross won him an a much deserved award at SXSW, and Jonathan Michael Trautmann also did a wonderful job."
7698,"As with "" The East "", the other co-writer and director is her friend Zal Batmanglij and, as with "" Another Earth "" and "" THe East "". Brit Marling stars as Maggie, the mysterious cult leader with Richard Wharton as Klaus, her dedicated right hand man who brings the members and potential members of the the small group of followers to Maggie's home where she conducts meetings in her basement."
7701,"Casting Jack Black in the title role of this 2012 dark comedy turns out to be a masterstroke on the part of director and co-screenwriter Richard Linklater because the real - life character of Bernie Tiede is a comically ambiguous figure not only sexually but more to the point, as a jovial child - man personality beloved by his small Texas town of Carthage while at the same time, strangely insistent in his constant presence in their lives. As Bernie becomes indispensable to the fabric of the community with his acts of charitable kindness, his Broadway - style choir solos, and his gentlemanly way of comforting widows in the throes of their grief, the ever - scowling Marjorie is always ready for battle with not only the townsfolk who impede on her life but even her immediate family who can't stand her. Bernie, however, is able to breakthrough her icy veneer with his cheery persistence, and their relationship evolves into an unhealthy codependence to put it mildly. As Marjorie lavishes Bernie with expensive gifts and luxurious vacations, she grows increasingly manipulative in her need to control his every move to meet her every need. Much like Warren Beatty did in "" Reds "", Linklater uses them as a cumulative Greek chorus who on one hand, provide some of the film's biggest laughs, and on the other, illustrate just how myopic and oppressive a small town can be in its rumor mongering ways, so much so that Bernie's trial has to be moved fifty miles away in order to allow the light of objectivity to filter into the proceedings."
7702,"Consequently, a good chunk of viewers will be turned off or frustrated by "" Take This Waltz, "" losing patience with the inaction of its characters and pulling their hair out over the tension oozing out of the most casual character interactions. The end of the movie is bound to bother a lot of people, while others will be intrigued at the choice and make peace with what Polley has to say because she frankly makes a good argument. The film tries to be about the entropy of nice, stable relationships versus the appeal of the hot Bohemian stranger who promises an erotic candy shop of delights. Seth Rogen is surprisingly effective in his role as the geeky, but loving husband. That statement has nothing whatsoever to do with anything else in Take This Waltz."
7711,"Emily Blunt is good as a young widow, but it's not the visceral type of performance you might expect from a movie like this where deep primal feelings are supposedly explored and vented. Usually, with aspects like these, combined with beautiful scenery, a movie isn't tough to get through. Emily Blunt (love her accent), Rosemarie Dewitt and Mark Duplass effortlessly became three characters who could be anyone you know in your own town. Blunt is pretty, Duplass has some amusing moments, and DeWitt has a very watchable awkwardly nihilistic manner about her. The secluded locale - without phones, computers and the usually daily distractions - is the conduit which allows the abundance of emotions and introspective feelings bubble up and expose themselves to a trio of characters connected in various and interesting ways."
7740,"McConaughey is absolutely mesmerizing as this badass detective who's a hit - man on the side. All the genres it glosses over fit right into this depraved story arc, and it grips you to the screen from beginning to end. It's a quite amazing performance, and her scenes with an almost equally impressive McConaughey provide the film's highlights. If the film has a definite strong point, it is in the performances. Man it's good to have Friedkin back pushing peoples buttons!"
7748,"The city has ways of putting up barriers between people, and the theme of the film is that successfully making a life in such a place requires physically and mentally breaking through those barriers. Despite the urban philosophizing and beautiful cinematography, "" Medianeras "" does not demand to be taken too seriously. It's a fun, optimistic, romantic comedy which declares that, as one of the songs in the film puts it, "" true love will find you in the end . "" The opening night film for the 2011 La Mirada Film Festival was the romantic drama Medianeras (aka Sidewalls), the debut feature from writer / director Gustavo Tarreto, who has made a lot of short films in his native Argentina. Medianeras is based on his own award winning 2005 short film, and tells the story of Martin and Mariana, two people living in separate apartments within the same block in Buenos Aires."
7763,"This is one of those little gems that is precious and hard to find. just the dialog and in one scene with Alan Tudyk, the hilarious look on his face told volumes. Both actresses form Modern Family were excellent. Alan Tudyk was great as always."
7764,"John Mark Byers, stepfather of Christopher Byers, makes peace with Echols and is now convinced of their innocence. American documentary filmmakers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinosfsky's third documentary feature about the The Robin Hood Hills Murders which took place in West Memphis, Arkansas in USA in early May 1993, was preceded by "" Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills "" (1996) and "" Paradise Lost 2: Revelations "" (2000). Berlinger and Sinosky persevered, as did others who feel that the verdict was unjust. While the film uses newsreel footage of the crime and court testimony, plus endless interviews with the accused killers and family members and townsfolk, the documentary tries to remain objective, but never really does achieve that status. (The film also could have been more effective if it included more of the aftermath once Echols, Misskelly, and Baldwin were released, observing their individual choices once freed.)"
7768,"As one film journalist noted, "" That Samsara is instantly one of the most visually - stunning films in the history of cinema is reason enough to cherish it, but Fricke and co-editor Mark Magidson achieve truly profound juxtapositions, brimming with meaning and emotion. It sounds preposterous, but it's true: In 99 minutes, Samsara achieves something approaching a comprehensive portrait of the totality of human experience. "" If you ever come across the chance to see this film in a decent theatre, run, and let your eyeballs (and earholes) feast upon its brilliance. The film chronicles the living conditions, the activities, and the day - to - day routines of many different people across twenty - five different countries. To put it simply, this is one of the best, most intellectually stimulating films of the last ten years."
7771,"The writers of this movie and whoever has given it good reviews must've been on some kinda substance. This movie is so senseless it makes David Hasselhoff's singing career look brilliant. There's definitely nothing new or original to the story but the scares are effective and well done. After some easy scares and cool effects, the movie take his path to a dramatic ending. One of the biggest problems is how quick it wants to start."
7798,"This is no masterpiece, but it's not quite as bad as some of the reviews make it out to be."
8090,"The body's changing, hormones are overloading the brain, and the once pointless female is miraculously the best thing on the planet. Dr. King seems to create a balanced relationship with Donald as he stays honest with his situation and acknowledges his anger instead of trying to subdue it. It's nice to see Andy Serkis for real this time - he does a wonderful job even when not hidden behind fancy CG. To help manage his emotions with his practically imminent demise, Donald draws himself as a superhero battling the evil Dr. Glove. It's always nice seeing Andy Serkis in his actual skin and Thomas Sangster's performance is nothing short of impressive."
7819,"Jenny has created a perfect, clean, safe world with her husband in a small organic foods business, and she is surprised and a little baffled about Lucy's arrival. And Mira Sorvino is one of the most underrated actresses out there. This film is better than most reviewers give it credit for. The primary redeeming factor of this film is the length: mercifully a short 80 minutes."
7827,"Many movies have recently tried to have a happy ending for all involved and in life that's actually not the case. High school reunions can be equal parts helpful to ones current life position and poisonous all the same for one specific reason and that is it gives them or their new significant other insight as to who they were and what they did during their four years in school. Do yourself a favour, don't pay attention to the naysayers and give this movie a chance, you will enjoy it! 10 Years is not a laugh out comedy, but it has it's funny moments. Apparently Jake and Mary were pretty much a perfect couple during their teenage years."
7870,"It was also great to see a piece Of work from Gay Cinema that could break the boundaries of the genre and work well in mainstream film festivals like RIIFF! The actors are very convincing, particularly the two young film makers, Danny and Chris, as they explore a potential romance. Meanwhile, Richard Harmon explodes on the screen as the troubled Danny, willing to sacrifice everything, including love, for the ever elusive gold ring that is success. Mr. Harmon is brilliantly watchable, despite the character of Danny having so many flaws."
7875,"And while the men are reduced to (nasty, ignorant, or at least naive) animals that can't help but exert their primal urges (' without the brothel all women would get raped all the time' is a telling quote), it's the madams' treatment of their girls that will truly horrify any viewer. What makes the film unique is that there is no narration or cuts to "" experts "" and hardly any interviews. You don't just have prostitutes and johns milling around, you have small children and animals running around as well."
7878,"Easily the redeeming factor of this film are the juxtapositions of Williams in his heyday and Williams today. moments, terrific vintage clips, and good interviews, especially with his long - time band leader. For Williams--who generously consented to Kessler's cameras AND provided him with boxes of videos for the documentary (without these contributions there would be absolutely no film)--this film provides a reminder of Williams. Much credit to him for including some of the scenes that are things a lot of people would have taken out. He became hooked on various substances and fame."
7884,"Yet another awesome example of documentary kicking fiction's butt in the creation of monstrous characters, and nothing says this better than the agent (read: child catcher) that enthusiastically talks about bringing happiness and wealth to all of the girls and their families, and how this mantra of helping others must exist because he had been a bad man in a previous life. David Redmon and Ashley Sabin's Girl Model is a lot like Lee Hirsch's directorial debut in the documentary world, Bully, which came out earlier this year. The way it depicts the fragility and the weakness at the core of this thirteen years old girl, and her friend, feels real. Their humane side is way more beautiful then their looks and it makes you angry to see how this world allows the practice of exploiting, not just poverty and hopes, but also innocence. Just saw this at MIFF today and found it very absorbing."
7925,The documentary really does do a good job at making the viewer a fly on the wall in terms of everything that went on with the production of the album.
7935,"Seemingly a perfect way to start, a back - story is implied begging to be told, and future events destined to unfold to eventually come together in an interesting climax and dÃ©nouement. His first novel was a moderate success and he is most likely suffering from various creative blocks, probably not helped by the fact that his ex-wife has a restraining order against him, prohibiting him from seeing his daughter. He is in the sleazy part of Paris inhabited by North Africans and Moroccans and finds a degree of solace in a tiny cafÃ©, the beautiful Polish waitress Ania (Joanna Kulig) offers him coffee and introduces him to the owner, Sezer (Samir Guesmi) who allows him to room in the filthy place, an offer that is accompanied by a' job' where he will be a night watchman in a warehouse visited by shadowy figures who must give a code for Tom to allow entry. It is at this point that the film becomes purposefully deranged and bizarre and the audience is left with merely some ideas and clues as to what has really happened. One is Ania (Joanna Kulig), a Polish waitress in Sezer's cafÃ© who has a healthy interest in poetry."
7960,"It wasn't the animation; though "" - Milos "" utilizes a completely different kind of design and animation than either of the two anime series, once you've accepted that contrast it's easy to marvel at how good - looking it is (almost like a cousin of Ghibli animation). As a fan after watching the whole episodes it's a great thing to see something new about Fullmetal Alchemist but not in this way. A pitch - perfect dub, a redraw of all the bits of writing, new mouth movements, and significant music add up to quite an effort to pitch this to general audiences in the U. S. as a breakout movie. For those wanting to feast their eyes on flashy Japanese animation, or simply to escape from the dullness of everyday life, this motion picture will be a good time. It should be viewed as another chance to spend time with the Elric brothers, though perhaps this time on an ever slightly more epic journey than usual."
8013,"The film does a fantastic job at giving you true / false hints about who could be involved in the invasion; and you really spend an hour wondering if it's true and who could it be, just like in these great Italian giallo. It's nice to find that Wingard has great respect for his target audience, he's made a film for fans of the sub-genre and inserted a darkly comic streak that pays off royally. The plot points are not so obvious and Sharni Vinson is the heroin that every viewer will cheer on. You're Next doesn't reinvent anything, but it consistently and confidently keeps the formula well oiled and proves to be one of the better films of its type. Aside from the perfunctory killings, the first 25 minutes is dedicated to bringing a whole lot of these characters on screen a few at a time."
8015,"The family band, popular in the late 60's was composed of five brothers, one little sister and their mother. The Cowsills were a band made up of brothers, one sister and their mom, ho had a few major hit records in the ate 60s. They talk about family secrets, revealing a family who was far from the perfect, happy family the public saw. Wonderful documentary by Louise Palanker that chronicles the oft posed but rarely answered question: What happened to The Cowsills? This documentary reveals the truth behind the all - American, happy family image put forth in such hits as "" Indian Lake "" and "" The Rain, The Park . """
8054,"One day he fakes of an eye injury in the class, and Sebastian take him to the hospital. Another beauty of the film is that there is no heightened drama or dialogues or anything. The slow build of the characters is fabulous with the relationships unfolding, refolding and unfolding back again. Hopefully by the time most people read this review this marvelous movie will be readily available on DVD with English subtitles. Anyone who loved Plan B probably will love Ausente too."
7691,"As many others have pointed out, the series is superbly put together: the actors are great; the script, if anything, is minimalist and the production excellent. Well thought out plots, characters, settings and really good storytelling. Different point of view, different stories, different but natural talented faces. It questions your life, routines, choices you made, the basic code of ethics you have."
8559,"Even though the hormone treatments have done wonders with his outward appearance--facial hair, muscles, deep voice etc., the one thing they haven't helped him get rid of are his breasts. He is everything that Lukas wants to be--perfect body and the confidence to go with it. And, sure, because to see it is the basic way for discover the profound moving confession about yourself and the others and the borders betweem that. Nevertheless Romeos is an enjoyable movie, the narrative treats its protagonist with respect and dignity, and the acting and production value is good quality. What is important and what this movie does so well, is dealing with the topic so problematic for any transgendered person that was ever attracted to someone of the same gender; which is, how to explain to others that being attracted to a woman doesn't make you a man - but feeling like a man does."
7743,"Backed by a strong cast including Paul Dano, Steve Coogan, Antonio Banderas, Annette Bening, and Elliott Gould, Ruby Sparks attempts to be that latest independent film to bring audiences something new and creative. Deborah Ann Woll has a scene as Calvin's ex-girlfriend and it is probably the best written scene in the film. In a world full of remakes and sequels, it is becoming more and more rare to get something truly original. If you are ready and willing to take a break from the big budget spectacles of Hollywood, then give this character study a chance you will be pleasantly surprised. Well it took six years, but co-directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris finally deliver their follow - up to the smash hit Little Miss Sunshine."
7818,"Pauline might be the most interesting character within the genre in years and has the potential to become the cult - equal to Carrie. AnnaLynne McCord completely disappears into her character and gives an insanely off the wall, brilliant performance that will leave you bug - eyed. Luminous and vibrant, these scenes impact and leave a stain that won't come out in a cold wash. AnnaLynne McCord and Traci Lords gave strong performances that really carried the movie, particularly Lords who successfully left the Adult Industry and became a credible actress. The acting was outstanding by AnnaLynne Mccord and Traci Lords who made the film well worth a watch."
7738,"To begin with, structurally it mirrors exactly the first film - cultural differences, relationship put under test, climax and separation, relief and happy ending."
7820,"Hand - picked by Haneke himself, these two bring a lifetime of experience to their roles; their performances are breathtaking. The claustrophobia of their lives, increasingly shut off from the rest of the world, is intense. Theirs is a holistic, private world that outsiders try to break into; there is a great piece of symbolism, early on in the film, after Georges and Anne return from the concert, where they discover that someone has tried to break into their apartment. The wounds that each can inflict on the other, knowing each other inside out, hit the audience like a punch to the gut. It is part of the searing authenticity of the film, and that makes the more tender moments even more special."
7821,"Deep understanding of others creative work often springs into criticism - but thats only positive since it means that the other one has understood the creation and is able to add something new into it - thus being part of the logics of progress. If the film - makers idea was to first give you a really great view of how some of these indie developers do their stuff and why, then have you on the edge of your seat as release day looms and problems arrive, then finish by leaving you a little bit misty and in a really good mood? This film helps to put human faces and personalities on to the development process, and offers a truly unique look into the pressure and personal sacrifices that can often be found for a new (or experienced) indie developer. This documentary takes a fairly in depth look at the lives of 3 particular games being developed, and the personal lives of those creating it (Fez, Super Meat Boy and Braid). As this film shows, these somewhat socially - hermitted developers (due to their passion for perfection) go to extreme lengths to provide a thoroughly engrossing and enjoyable experience for you, the user."
7822,"But the major scene - stealing performances here are from Ariel Winter as Carrie Kelley, who those unfamiliar with the story may be shocked to find allying herself with Batman, and from Gary Anthony Williams as The Mutant Leader - a more dangerous Killer Croc - style villain who is the mastermind behind many of the events at this stage of the story. This is a very violent, post-modern Gotham, not too unlike Christopher Nolan's' The Dark Knight Trilogy', and younger children are better directed towards either Adam West or, if animated, then' Batman: The Animated Series' and its successors. Some scenes are switched around, redacted or, in some cases, even enhanced, making this quite an interesting watch for general Batman fans and fans of this specific comic book. It holds a retrospective quality that, perhaps, Mr. Zimmer also wanted to infuse in his score owing to the fact that that film's inspiration was drawn heavily from Frank Miller's comic book' The Dark Knight Returns'. So influential was Frank Miller's "" The Dark Knight Returns "" that it inspired Tim Burton and Christopher Nolan when they were crafting their live action Batman movies, as well as the 1990s Batman animated series (which gave birth to an entire universe of DC animated shows)."
7823,"The caveat of such scenarios is in that they constantly, silently and almost purposefully marginalize the inherent, all consuming, self - perpetuating environment and ill - conceived culture that money in and all by itself creates, even for "" the winners of the game "". Basically good, sympathetic, or at least, interesting characters, you can relate to and care for, encounter obstacles, have to struggle for a while, but ultimately find their way through an unfriendly or simply indifferent world. Costa Gavras made his name in the genre of international political thriller, picking his subjects to be the most promising themes for such a film at a given time. It's interesting that Costa - Gavras chose to make a personal diatribe against finance through his "" Capital "" since he's most renowned for his politically - oriented themes that contributed to such memorable movies as "" Z "" or "" Missing "". It's regrettable because Costa - Gavras had the material for a good film, not the most subtle one, but for a gripping thriller and fair entertainment."
7824,"Daniel Day - Lewis is something of an unsung miracle; the man will come out of nowhere, select an unlikely role, knock it out of the park, then quietly crawl back into the ground for the next three or four years before repeating the same process. He is an underrated talent most likely due to his lack of a prolific career, somewhat like director Terrence Malick. Here, Day - Lewis teams up with one of Hollywood's most prolific men, Steven Spielberg, who is coming off a stellar 2011, where he produced both Super 8 and Transformers: Dark of the Moon and directed both The Adventures of Tintin and War Horse, two acclaimed pictures. Lincoln is a stunning humanization and coloring - book job of American politics, shedding a light on the skepticism and grayness of the government during that time."
7989,"There is a funny moment where a character freaks out about getting ranch dressing on his pants, but that's about it. Imagine Frank Castle had a pet cat he loved dearly and found out the someone took the cat and killed it but he doesn't know that the king pin was behind the murder and goes out with dead pool looking for answers. The two main guys were great and the guest stars were mostly hilarious, except one was a wasted performance. And there were some great talents on the cast list and some familiar faces here and there, which was quite nice. What is always great, is small supporting Rolex by know actors, and there's a bunch of them here, like Elijah Wood, Kirsten Wiig, David Rasche, Ryan Phillippe, Adam Brody, Garret Dillahunt, Kevin Corrigan, Stephen Payne, Gillian Jacobs, Amy Seimetz, Helen Rogers, Bobby Moynihan, John Di Benedetto, Brian Donahue and so on."
7825,"Save yourself some time and energy and read Youtube comments instead of watching this "" movie "". ' NATURE CALLS': Four Stars (Out of Five) Patton Oswalt and Johnny Knoxville play rival brothers who grew up disagreeing the most on scouting (which their father loved). Kirk grew up hating scouting and went into business with his friend Gentry (the hilarious Rob Riggle). The cast is all topnotch and writer / director Todd Rohal did a great job of delivering a madcap 80's style comedy. But it is entertaining and Patton Oswalt holds it together very nicely."
7826,"It's kind of got a feel good vibe but also a lot of demented moments. No masterpiece of vampire movies, but right for a fun night. Amy Heckerling tells a nice story, with sharp direction, candy colored set design, and some enviable fashions. It is a vampire movie with heart, but has some welcome nods to movies of horror's past. Richard Lewis, does an amazing job, his best role in years."
7736,"The same people who rate this movie down are the same people who go rate down Schwarzenegger films because they have a silly plot, it's not about the plot, it's about hardcore action and silly punchlines, just like this movie is about funny conversations and a fun plot. "" The Watch "" is a funny buddy comedy, filled with crude jokes and the silly shenanigans that you'd expect from Stiller, Vaughn, the rest of the cast, and writer Seth Rogen. The only people who can find this funny are stoned high teenagers and kids that just learned a new word, DICK. If you treat it like a joke, you will have a lot of laughs. Under the eye of director Akiva Schaffer ("" Hot Rod "") and penmanship of writers Jared Stern, Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen, however, the film is badly - managed and all over the map â€” thematically speaking."
7828,"The fight sequences and the chase scenes are not only amazing, but exhilarating, but the strongest aspect goes to the animation. In this film DreamWorks did it all exactly right. Jack Frost is a charming lead, Nicholas St. North (or Santa Claus) is a bada ** character with his Russian accent and has a sleigh machine, the Sandman is silent, but that's what makes him more interesting and his comedic moments is funny, the Tooth Fairy (or Toothiana) is a beautiful female character and the way she explains her ways of getting all of the children's tooth is well thought out, and Bunnymund, the easter bunny, is a great fighter and by the far the most hilarious character that most people would adore. Sad moments, glad moments, hilarious moments. The quality of animation is superb and is the score contributed by Alexandre Desplat, and again, the simple tale, its treatment and development, are refreshing in not biting off more than it can chew."
7830,"The actors all did fine jobs, Eric Bana as the robber who is a killer, Olivia Wilde as the little sister who maybe has outgrown her need to be protected, Charlie Hunnam as her troubled but worthwhile romantic interest, Sissy Spacek and Kris Kristofferson as his parents, Kate Mara as the aspiring FBI agent deputy, and Treat Williams as her father the Sheriff. Their performances were all worthy of this well written and directed feature. It's there the siblings are reunited in a terse and thrilling showdown that pushes the bonds of family to the limit. Charlie Hunnam is fun to watch, he is smart and never looks bad in what he does. Sissy Spacek and Kris Krsitoppher are good."
7831,"The movie is brimming with great character development, and morality themes regarding the human rebellions before the covenant attack. It was a much, much higher quality than you would expect for a bunch of web videos."
7835,"The animators have outdone themselves with the classic style that almost makes the technology disappear, which is a wonderful change of pace in the 3 - D crazy animated film department. This is one of the best pieces of animation to come out of the Walt Disney Company in years! The story is lovely and sweet and full of emotions along seven minutes running time: love, disappointment, expectations, frustration, fantasy and romance that entertain a lot."
7836,"The Hitchcock humor is allowed to shine through and his battles with Paramount Studio head Barney Balaban (Richard Portnow) and the censorship board (Kurtwood Smith) are excellent. Slavish in its adoration of a director who, on a good day, could be amongst the best in the business and on a bad one, just about the worst ("" Torn Curtain "", anyone?) Director Sasha Gervasi works off a screenplay by John J, McLaugnlin based on the book "" Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho "" by Stephen Rebello and a good portion of the film is fascinating stuff. From the casting interviews with Anthony Perkins (played dead on by James D'Arcy) and Janet Leigh (Scarlett Johansson) to how Hitchcock didn't want to use music during the infamous shower scene but was convinced by his wife and the editors or how upon first cut of the film or how the test audience (which consisted of suits, agents and censors) loathed the film and its violent content; the peak behind the closed set doors was captivating viewing."
7837,"The most profound moments appeared after the end of the play when the inmates stopped pretending they were actors and had to face the reality that heir cell was once more a prison and staring at the ceiling for infinity resumed. The common spaces are illustrated exceptionally well and after a while one feels lost in a limbo between the prison and Rome. The performances are so convincing that one has to contemplate on the nature of human destiny. Though there were hints of this for example when the inmate who plays Brutus has a momentary pause about how a line in the play conjures a memory of an exchange with a friend from his past, this moment is brushed immediately aside and the actors continue to rehearse. The moments of rehearsing are, with the help of camera work, editing and music, made to look like they are parts of play itself, whilst the situations when the prisoners are out of character see them still acting, thus ironically making the actual play on the stage the only nonfictional part of the movie."
7708,"Everyone did a great job with their characters and it was a blast to hear all these familiar voices in a film together again. Now for the other demographic (13 and up), the film is still a really fun experience having jokes that adults would get, as well as some really funny situations. Bringing a quicker, bigger, and more spectacular visuals to the film and make it a non-stop ride and worth it in 3D. The penguins having the best gags and King Julien being crazy. While everything is fun, the wonderful visuals adds the film's enjoyment."
7707,"Mark Duplass and Jake Johnson are excellent, and that new kid Karan Soni. the story keeps you hooked until the credits roll. Duplass and Plaza are simply perfect together as both of them bring the weirdness and loneliness out of their characters but they also have such a warm and wonderful chemistry that you can't help but fall for both of them. Instead, the excellent script keeps itself at bay and manages to tell a story that is more sincere than one would expect and feels more real than a dramady that is trying to be the most realistic of human stories. Connolly shows an efficient control over the multiple sub-plots, and they all share subjects in common."
7842,"Freeman is a good Bilbo and his mannerisms work well (which helps negate his limited range) while of course McKellen is always welcome. Morevoer, even as stuffed to the gills as it is with material from Tolkien's appendices to LoTR and other things that should make the world come alive and draw you in to the back story, much of it doesn't makes sense. The rest of the cast are all fine but to be honest the effects are the main stars here and technically it is very impressive even if it is a bit overdone at times. The great achievement of the LOTR films is how they managed to distill the huge source novels to their most important story beats, only hinting at most of the wider story in a way that brought incredible richness to the world in which they take place. There were actually only two great scenes: Riddles in the Dark is amazing, but ironically, it also painfully shows how mediocre the rest of the movie actually is, because this is the only moment that comes close to the level of LOTR."
7844,"There are plenty of decent moments in Hyde Park on Hudson including Murray as FDR and some wonderful shots of beautiful country landscapes. The highlight of the film is a glorious scene of a conversation between Bertie and FDR regarding their personal physical embarrassments and their joint world views. As the characters develop and the drama unfolds, it becomes clear the only real constant theme here is the shedding of false ideas about others and the self. From this point on, all of the relationships become more real and approachable. While always being a good actor it's only in the last 15 or so years that people have stood up and taken notice that he can act beyond his comedic roots."
7706,"As in other Murphy movies, there is some gentle social commentary and nerdy white people are often played for laughs--Murphy's assistant is especially hilarious as he inverts the common logic of the uncool / uptight white guy at times to assume a "" gangsta "" persona to take over Murphy's job duties while Murphy can only watch, wide - eyed, as the silent straight man. Also the cinematography is excellent with some remarkable scenes. In both movies, Murphy's character is a successful businessman who is a little lost personally and spiritually (which is an immediately recognizable sensation for almost anyone at some point in their lives). This is Eddie's best film in many years. New - age spiritual guru roles are traditionally played for laughs, but Curtis displays some comedic - inspired subtle turns here and the film overall displays a surprising sensitivity towards spiritual matters in general."
7846,"Even in terms of story and direction, it is a very accomplished work. The new guy Tom, does good job and looks cute but he does not have that mischief and innocent pure face and eyes of Jagger. As gay' romances' go it's certainly up - front and honest and hardly sentimental but the 10 year gap between the two films gives this the feeling of an afterthought. One of the guys in the group, Tom is gay and he and the others are very comfortable with it. Its Tom, who make Yossi come out of his cocoon and he helps Yossi evaluate his problems over a period of time and Tom helps him bring back being comfortable with who he is."
7847,"It's a very captivating film (even with its 160 minutes runtime), and the big raid at the end is quite intense and realistic. every single scene looked to create tension, drama, and purpose towards the goal of catching osama. Its strongest feature is its dramatization of the Navy Seal Team 6 operation in Abbottabad, Pakistan, that killed bin Laden. Regarding the death of UBL - well the movie even leaves that open ended which is pretty consistent with the actual reported events."
7848,"There is a lot blood in this movie, romantic scenes without the sex, and the skilled City detectives and Federal agents are portrayed as totally inept goof - ups. When the script calls for him to tell his U. S. marshal girlfriend one quick sentence about firefighting, you know perfectly well that he'll say that line again, during a fire, before the end of the movie. Now Duhamel has been in some Transformers movies and some other stuff."
7754,"The thing of it is, ParaNorman is pretty scary stuff for a PG movie, so you've been properly warned. Adults will love the stylish, almost Gothic atmosphere; older teens will love the menace of both the zombies and the townspeople, not to mention the witch herself. Anyway, there's a sort of beauty in ParaNorman, as horror and light comedy are somehow blended to form a rich animated film. ParaNorman follows a misunderstood boy who is able to speak to the dead. This film not only delivers something new and different with an almost played out genre, it manages to stand out and entertain on numerous levels."
7850,"Dolph Springer (Jack Plotnick) lives in suburban L. A., waking up at 7: 60 am everyday, returning to his former place of employment where indoor rainfall occurs and he pretends to do work even after he was fired three months ago. Jack Plotnick is well - suited for the role of a neurotic guy always on the edge of losing his mind. This would make all of his interactions stronger, but, luckily, people like William Fictner pull off dead - pan humor wonderfully, and his few scenes are delights as he first puts Dolph through the rigmarole to see him, and then gives him a book on how to talk to his dog through his mind. They contribute to a feeling that there is something deeper being said, and by the end one walks out with a feeling that Dupieux subtly and ever so brilliantly schooled the audience. This movie isn't for everyone; you will see many a 1 - star review from people who like movies like "" Bad Boys "" and "" The Expendables ""."
7853,"He plans a weekend visit with Joyce in New Jersey, but upon an intriguing discovery about her past, he invites her on an eight - day cross-country road trip with him. The film is at its comedic best when she and co-star Seth Rogen as Andy volley back and forth with her well - meaning thoughts and antics at odds with his spiky annoyance at anything she says or does. There's also quite a supporting cast here, but like Streisand movies of yore, the familiar actors contribute moments that amount to nearly bit parts. Kathy Najimy and Miriam Margolyes are among Joyce's Weight Watchers friends in a quick dinner scene early in the story, while Adam Scott and Ari Graynor show up at the very end of the road trip in San Francisco. But that's fine since Rogen really lets Streisand dominate the movie all the way from pushing off potential suitors at a mature singles mixer to getting into the wrong car at a mini-mart pit - stop to getting drunk in a motel bar to sharing her innocently ignorant perceptions of stereotypes."
7854,"No, all they needed was a reason for some good old steak and potatoes action and a star to anchor it all. 2012's Jack Reacher has these qualities in spades. Robert Duvall comes in as a retired USMC Gunnery Sgt, Gunny Cash, who does a masterful job as the owner of a gun range and inserts some humor as he deals with Reacher. But this is Cruise's film, and it is one of the best action thrillers in recent years. Mr. Duvall always delivers a convincing performance, same here."
7703,"George and Linda (Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston) buy an apartment in New York and immediately find themselves out of work. They might as well be wearing labels - "" Funny obnoxious brother "", "" funny spaced out sister in law "", "" funny nudist man who doesn't listen to you "", "" funny weird hippy lady "", "" funny pregnant lady "" etc. . this is a great couples movie and may cause some to question their life's objectives and their relationships. Nicely paced, crisp dialogue, believable circumstances and plausible events with sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Not that a movie like this requires great acting skills, but the roles played by Rudd, Aniston and Watkins are at least believable."
7855,"Tarantino has always focused upon the action thriller genre from Reservoir Dogs up until Inglourious Basterds. However, Django Unchained is Tarantino's first look at the Western genre, his first attempt at it and he executed it beautifully. The scenes were shot perfectly alongside an amazing soundtrack as well as his own small cameo. The cast boast out amazing performances, particularly Christoph Waltz (also famous for his previous collaboration with Tarantino on Inglourious Bastards as Colonel Landa). Both Foxx and DiCaprio's performance are both equally amazing."
7725,"The only truly funny scene is when Adam (a bored looking Alex Pettyfer) is first backstage with Tarzan and the other strippers. The stripping sequences, filled with energy and sexiness, are mostly played for laughs. Still, it's a film BOTH genders can enjoy, and it shouldn't be limited to "" a movie for the ladies . "" The character that was somewhat interesting was Dallas and he stripped the least (sorry ladies)."
7700,"Even one of the best scenes in the whole movie (Rapace's DIY Cesarean) is just glossed over like it didn't happen when. After the procedure, she's simply "" stitched together "" by metal clips in like 3 seconds - and with a bit of local anesthetic, she continues to move and jump about with some moaning. It has a couple of "" for effect "" gore scenes - but Scott manages to include ZERO tension along with them. In Prometheus however they may well have all been androids as Rapace apart, they were all taking death and destruction remarkably in their stride. The use of 3D is excellent and the art direction is amazing."
7724,"Wahlberg and Kunis are generally pretty convincing, even if it's a bit weird that John is mature enough to have a relationship last four years but not enough to not screw things up at his job or avoid giving in to Ted's peer pressure. That said, some of its best jokes and references will resonate on a personal level, i. e. if you watch this with a group of people, you're bound to laugh really hard at times when they don't and vice-versa. At the age of eight (8) years old and with no real friends of his own, little John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) makes a Christmas wish for his teddy bear to come to life. Despite a serious relationship of four years with Lori (Mila Kunis), nearly middle - aged John is still ripping bongs and watching '80s "" Flash Gordon "" with his equally irresponsible teddy bear best friend. Audiences will write you off if you deliver them something inconsistent and scatter - brained that goes beyond 30 inconsequential minutes of their lives, and MacFarlane and co-writers Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild make the majority of adjustments needed to honor that notion."
8017,"For 20 months from 1987 to 1989, Downey ran a self - titled TV talk show that was part - riot, part - circus, a little bit Jerry Springer, Rush Limbaugh and later Bill O'Reilly and Michael Moore. After He was Discovered Hoaxing an Attack by Skinheads, it was All Over. The Morton Downey Jr. show at its peak was a bold experiment in audience participation - the one criteria for the show's production seemed to be to get the audience to actively participate in the harshest and loudest way possible. But the truth is that he stumbled into the MDJ Show format after stumbling earlier into some talk radio shows and after doing some right - to - life activism that taught him that outrageousness and populism sells. And, really, the modern shows make a lot more coherent sense than MDJ ever did."
7856,"The reviewers have so far been less than kind about his film--one major reviewer suggesting that all the characters are so horrible he wanted to sell the bunch of them to white slavers--but one suspects Apatow could care less. You may recall a major hit a few years ago entitled KNOCKED UP by Director Judd Apatow. Like almost all his flicks, this movie has laughs, heart and drama."
7857,"Because it occurred in the Christmas season and hit many resort area beaches its death toll of almost 250, 000 was indiscriminate, taking not only South Asians but many visiting vacationers. How do you frame such a catastrophe in human terms, and present a situation of pure chaos in a way that makes a compelling story? Both the film itself and the filmmakers have taken pains to say that this is a "" true story, "" and they have aimed for the greatest possible authenticity in the circumstances. They have based themselves on detailed interviews with the family members and with other survivors, some of whom actually appear in the film. The director Juan Antonio Bayona, teasing superb performances even from his youngest cast members."
7858,"A well - executed and powerful musical from Tom Hooper,' Les MisÃ©rables' stood alongside' Skyfall' as Britain's two main entries at the 2013 Academy Awards and left with 3 Oscars. Featuring some bravura performances from an all - star cast including Anne Hathaway (Oscar winner), Hugh Jackman (Oscar nominated), Russell Crowe, Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter. Set against the sweeping backdrop of 19th - century France,' Les Mis' tells an enthralling and emotional story of passion, love and redemption, accompanied by some stunning cinematography, uplifting musical numbers and flawless direction. While it does drag on at parts,' Les Mis' is generally an impeccably crafted musical to be enjoyed by all. Russell Crowe was not PHENOMENAL, but was excellent in "" Stars "" and "" Javert's Soliloquy ""."
7859,"Some moments hit you hard man, real hard, you might be laughing one scene and then the next scene you just realized that the' thumb up' from one old man to the next gives chills on how life can end at any moment and at any time. The movie's casting is remarkable because the person that carries the show is Billy Connelly who enlivens the interaction with staff and residents to a degree that only his repartee can produce. But the warmth of the story - the vibrancy of the seniors playing string quartets and practicing their cellos and clarinets, their friendships, annoyances, disappointments, and even loves - marks this film as something very special. Hoffman has taken a beautiful English estate and turned it into a world of music filled with well - drawn and compelling characters: the woman with advancing dementia who relishes the CD of her performing Rigoletto 40 years ago; the flirtatious Wilf, whose "" advances "" towards the women on staff are never offensive and always charming; the aging diva - the always wonderful Maggie Smith - who is horrified by the thought that by moving in her life is over. The moments are there, you just have to know people - humanity."
7863,"Moneybags McEvil introduces himself as the gracious solution to all of their problems, nobody really knows what the game is or what's going on, but of course are sticking around, because, money. Combining something as elegant as a dinner party with the crude tasks forced up the guests produces a uniquely creepy atmosphere and it is pretty much all the movie has going for itself. He commands a presence at the top of the table and his evil is believable in large thanks to his charismatic and demented portrayal of sadistic Shepard Lambrick. The transition from refusal to willingly hurt others and trying to escape together to survival of the strong mentality was also fitting. The challenges should be new, inventive and unforeseeable to be impacting but none of the options are very original."
7864,"None the less this movie is exactly delivering what you're expecting, action, funny one - liners and huge amount of martial arts scenes, and some decent hand to hand combat scenes from Austin, and even a new upcoming guy is allowed to show off his kicks and punches. So if you like this kind of movie, you wannasee some decent action sequences and you don't mind the gaps in the script, then is a must see for you, otherwise, stay away from it. Director Waxman knows how to shoot the best sides of Stone Cold and Steven Seagal, as well he should based on the films he's done with each in the past (albiet separately as this marks the first team - up of the two) and the action scenes are pretty good which makes up for a fairly generic, heavily clichÃ© riddled script. The best thing about this movie is seeing two great icons, Segall "" Aikido Beats Everything "" and and "" Stone Cold "" Steve Austin, team up on the side of justice. A prison facility, everything initially goes smoothly until the arrival of two mysterious female prisoners who are to be moved on the next day."
7865,"This was an excellent family movie, had plenty of laughs and some really heartwarming moments. Parental Guidance is a pretty decent family comedy about bridging the generation gap, and the process of re-building relationships that have been neglected for a very long time. Grumpy Billy Crystal has some funny moments. They impart all sorts of touchy - feely, loving and encouraging words and phraseology on their 3 children. Turner Simmons (Joshua Rush) gives a sterling rendition of the "" Shot Heard' Round the World "" (New York Giants vs. Brooklyn Dodgers - 1951 World Series) and younger brother Barker (Kyle Harrison Breitkopf) has an imaginary invisible Kangaroo friend Carl (ala Jimmy Stewart's Harvey)."
7866,"There is some good humor here and some of the scenes make you laugh (the meat man being one). In a world full of kissing vampires and "" found Footage "" crap, "" John "" bring to the screen what seems to have been lost since great films like Altered States, and Videodrome. Coscarelli wisely uses live effects for most of his surreal sequences and otherworldly creatures and what little digital effects there are, are used sparingly and are decent enough. While not familiar with the book, the bizarre and surreal story does seem like a perfect fit for Coscarelli as his films have alway had a touch of both the surreal and a bit of offbeat whimsy. Paul Giamatti plays Arnie Blondestone, and he's absolutely perfect for the role."
7867,"If they actually did participate in the mob violence that night, some attention might have been usefully paid to the whole issue of how seemingly otherwise good kids from poor but stable homes with fathers present in their lives can get caught up in that kind of lawlessness. Reality is The Central Park Five's reason for being and one of the best documentaries in recent years."
7868,"It keeps your attention with a brisk pace and an energetic soundtrack that matched the feel of the scene Had the script been a bit more supportive on some biographies, you would feel for the characters as more than just expendable fodder for the Collector. But if you want to spend 90 minutes at a fun, gory flick, "" The Collection "" will do just fine. An incredible body count that would draw the attention of the CIA, FBI, and any local police much less the Criminal Minds - type teams. In The Collection, the psychopath killer is interesting & the contraptions he uses to trap, mutilated and / or kill his captives are certainly engaging. So worried about his rich daughter, the rich father recruits the guy from the first movie, the guy from OZ and easily killable mercenaries with automatic weapons and years of training to find the collector, save the girl and then return her."
7869,"The dialogue is more than believable, and both Matt Damon and John Kransinski both do a wonderful job in conveying their character's qualities and aspirations. All in all, even if political / social / ecological issues regarding hydrofracking aren't your forte, this film is a quality film that is captivating and deserves to have personal opinions set aside and enjoyed for its quality. If you don't see it in a theater it will play well on DVD. The result is an engaging and reflective look at people who have to lie outright in order to do their jobs, or to rely on half truths repeated enough times to be convincingly real, and that prick of conscience should that day arise. Written by Damon - Krasinski, the story is a fairly interesting one that takes on both a macro look at the problem at hand, where clean energy sources may not be as clean as it's made out to be, especially in the exploiting process, while on the micro level, has plenty of carefully crafted characters to carry the narrative through."
7734,"Blake Lively makes for good eye candy, but she just isn't a good actress. After making such brilliant films as JFK, Platoon and Natural Born Killers, you have lowered yourself to the likes of Wall Street 2 and this heaping pile of dog manure, Savages. She is paired up with 2 rich entrepreneurs. Â¨ Savages Â¨ is realized in frenetic style and fast - pace, similarly other Stone hits such as Â¨ Natural born killers Â¨ or Â¨ U turn Â¨. The Americans believe the Mexicans are savages because they decapitate people just because it's Tuesday."
7705,"For Kahaani is a ride so thrilling, your mind would be tripping with a million possibilities, even as your tongue invariably ends up either tied, or hanging in the air with anticipation. The film unfolds like the pages of a gripping novel by Agatha Christie or Sherlock Holmes and is shot like that of an Alfred Hitchcock or a Satyajit Ray. Using real people, places, and situations to underline the nuances of the story is a task that's handled brilliantly by director Sujoy Ghosh (also the co writer) whose recent claim to shame - an abysmal Aladdin, or a horrendous Home Delivery shall soon be forgotten just as Madhur Bhandarkar's debut dud was. In addition to the sterling performances and the plot is the terrific technical support. Be it Amitabh Bacchan's rendition of Tagore's' Ekla Chalo Re', the background songs (mostly of RD Burman), playing innocently as the characters travel the length and breadth of the city, the costumes by Sabyasachi, the' just right and yet dramatic' background score, the non-condescending cinematography that captures the city as if it were a character, and the supreme screenplay with a spattering of real Bengali, act as just the right spices to turn this into a delicious dish, that's both exotic as well as commonplace."
7872,"This flick is a small masterpiece with multiple layers and a great thorn in the eye for the hypocritical authority - Sweden! Gabriella Pilcher has with great accuracy and skill given birth to the characters and the surroundings of the small sleeping village and has created a human mosaic that forces all prejudices to burst. The immigrants have become the new working class. This is a glimpse into real working life Sweden, and real life for the many immigrants to the Nordic countries. But above all, Ã„ta Sova DÃ¶ is a unique portrait of a female character."
7755,The film is equal parts comedy and drama and actually allows both Jones and Samberg to show off their acting chops and do something a little more serious for a change. It's a funny and insightful film and both Jones and Samberg shine in it. When Jesse tells Celeste he's having a baby with his beautiful new girlfriend Veronica (Rebecca Dayan) it throws her for a loop and causes her to reevaluate her life and her feelings for Jesse. Samberg is great as well and it's nice to see him trying his hand at drama (and doing so successfully). He and Jones still have plenty of truly comedic moments as well (as does the rest of the cast) and they also have beautiful chemistry.
7874,"The premise here is compelling: members of the Weather Underground who are accused of murder after what appears to have been a bungled bank robbery have gone to ground, have built lives with varying degrees of success and respectability, only to have it all reopened years later when one of them decides to turn herself in. At the age of 76 (and yes, despite being fit and well put together, he really does look his age), Redford is at least ten years older than his role would demand. An important movie of a time lost, to the "" new "" technology of the gen - X. No cell phones, no computers."
7733,"It is rated that because it is a mature look at dysfunctional family problems. So while little of that is shown, they are referred to through the dialog, thus making it a mature film for teens and up. He layered his role with some interesting nuances. His interactions with the Elizabeth Banks character were entertaining and fairly genuine. Then meets with with lawyer, who gives a kit of 15 thousand dollars, but then sees a note that tells him to give it too Frankie (Elizabeth Banks) a recovering alcholic, and a single mother, and a waitress, trying to make ends meat."
7876,"The sparing use of beautiful and rather poetic animation works very well, and Jay Bulger himself refrains from including himself too much in the finished film - and when he does take centre stage for a moment, it's an extraordinary (and violent!) But it's the filmmaking that also shines here, pairing with the drummer's tales in perfect synchronization. As one enters the compound a sign clearly states Beware Mr. Baker, perhaps for good reason as Baker is still quite irascible and cantankerous. One of the brilliant touches of BEWARE OF MR. BAKER is the decision to go beyond the already memorable tales. The skillful and oftentimes funny animation makes full use of this iconography, emphasizing the bigger - than - life halo that slums around Mr. Baker's head."
7699,"Aardman Animations has probably been more consistent than Pixar, especially of late, yet the stop - motion powerhouse doesn't get half the attention. Intent on winning the prestigious Pirate of the Year award, the generically named Pirate Captain (Hugh Grant) scours the ocean in search of treasure with his deeply loyal crew of ham - loving pirates. The film moves at a brisk pace, perhaps because a lot of the traveling by boat happens in 2D animated sequences on a treasure map (though one of the pirate's jobs is to throw red discs out the back of the boat so that red dots show up on the map). The major sequences move quickly into one another, fitting some positive character and theme - building moments in between. Nothing about the story is that emotionally moving, though Martin Freeman voicing Pirate Captain's No. 2 man gives it a good go as the only logical or thoughtful character in the entire film who often calls Pirate Captain out on his impulsive and ignorant behavior."
7756,"As always Tim is amazing, he really brings all the emotions a father would feel towards his daughter and puts it into his performance and let's face it, who wouldn't want Tim Roth as their on - screen father? For this viewer this is one of the finest movies of the past year, a film so challenging and exquisitely crafted that it should be seen by everyone. The entire cast is first class â€“ this is the first film experience for Eloise Laurence and she is stunning, as are Tim Roth and Cillian Murphy and the rest. If you enjoy Brit flicks in the mould of Mike Leigh or Shane Meadows this is a must see. The child actors are superb especially Martha Bryant as the youngest of the feral siblings who is outstanding."
7732,"Hushpuppy herself isn't just a little girl, she is The Child--the purveyor of a magic which is real, intimately connected with her world, imaginatively linked with All Things. Everything in this film exists within the realm of archetype, and if you watch it with that in mind, its multiple messages take on cosmic significance. The beauty of this movie lies in Hushpuppy, a child young enough to be nonjudgmental, and her vision of life and its inhabitants. Looking back to it, this movie is a miracle as improbable as that of La Vita Ã© Bella, where Benigni infused humor in a story about the Holocaust without becoming offensive or demeaning. The community is comprised of other drunk people who also love and care about Hushpuppy, the young girl."
7879,"Superb use of Barry music throughout to accompany the narrative, and clips from the films to illustrate events. Connery's comments are occasionally heard, but they're from past interviews and used very fleetingly, over other clips. However, that is EXACTLY what "" Everything or Nothing "" manages to do by focusing on the creative talent behind the creation of Bond. But, if you want some great interviews and all the "" dirt "" on the creators, this will completely suck you in! In between all the justifications, there are some interesting interviews with past Bonds, so it's not all propaganda."
7757,"Some of these parts are cleverly thought out and also quite funny in parts. First of all the steel tubes are not just sawed and welded together, there are special sleeves that are fitted onto the tubes and then the tubes are welded to the sleeves, vastly increasing the strength. It's simply a fun, fast, and intense 90 - minute ride that's equal parts tension and comic relief. Gordon - Levitt stars as Wilee, an energetic bike messenger that lives by the simple rules of riding like hell, only using a fixed gear / steel framed bike, and never using brakes. There is some great stunts, its far fetched but its crazily fast."
7881,"Throughout the years, the IRA and the' troubles' in Northern Ireland have been a source of inspiration for countless British and Irish movies. are fine as secret service persons, but the best acting is done by Andrea Riseborouh as the proud and independent terrorist Collette McVeigh. The film is also excellent in recreating the atmosphere of the catholic working class neighbourhoods in Belfast (actually, it is shot in Dublin), where terrorism in the 1990's was a part of everyday life. This film not only succeeds as a film that belongs with the others mentioned, but it is really an impressive film. The lighting, scenery, costumes and photography, and background music all contribute to the film in a way that one expects of a great film about Britain in the 90s."
7882,"Nonetheless, this is a film that is definitely worth a look, not only for a few nice twists and turns in the plot, but the particularly strong performances from Thure Lindhardt and Zachary Booth, as the gay lovers, whose relationship reaches its nadir and then unceremoniously, fizzles out! But the cast is evenly strong, the best performance is carried out by a relatively unknown Dane Thure Lindhardt (as Erik Rothman); he is worth remembering, he has recently had several big roles in good productions. Thure Lindhardt, the Danish out - of - the - closet actor who has shown the immense stretch in the skin - head gay - romance BROTHERHOOD (2009, an 8/10), transforms himself into a young immigrant documentary director Erik living in NYC, probably sex - addictive, met the dandy boy Peter (Zachary Booth), first time for sexual intercourse, then the mutual attraction brings both into a relationship complex, which encompasses an overt hindrance, Paul's drug - addition, a clichÃ© default even makes for the consistent trappings of gay life, thanks to the barren soil of the genre. Thure Lindhardt is at the center of this film and he's really its only saving grace. The central relationship in this film is between gay men but the film manages to touch on failing / toxic relationships in general and offers up some noteworthy and humorous ensemble performances."
7883,"White was stunned that his teacher was there, whom in the early segments of the movie he had shown in a class picture and mentioned that he had "" loved "" her and how supportive she was to him. Finally, at Middle Tennessee State College he met some kindred spirits who were into the creative arts and their bonding helped him immensely. His creations, his drive, and his independent spirit are truly inspiring. Definitely recommended, for those interested in art and for everyone else who wants to be inspired to follow their passions. A Straightforward, No - Frills Documentary about "" Gonzo "" Artist Wayne White that goes Off the Rails Immediately when White Shows Up, Starts Talking and Showing His "" Wild and Crazy "" Art."
7731,"Not a lot happened before the villains are apprehended and the world returns to peace and harmony, as in any of the Ice Age movies. The pirates are entertaining as ever and very funny, the monkey played by Peter Dinklage is really good and the main plot flies along at a terrific pace. As with most sequels, the quality of the Ice Age movies is definitely regressing. Even in the Ice Age predecessors, he was always the funniest. The old gang don't dissatisfy either: Sid is the standout as usual but Diego gets more laughs than normal and Scrat's little journey is ever - amusing."
7758,"Then they mightily praise Oldman and Pearce for great acting when they were, in fact, just playing northern urban gangsters who like to behave over the top --- the very thing that disgusts southern sensibilities. Gary Oldman is always a pleasure to watch and Mia Wasikowska is lovely and does the most with the little she was given. Prohibition in rural Virginia means bootleggers and moonshiners can make a lot of money producing liqueur. The Bondurant brothers are amongst the most successful moonshiners in the state. Lawless was extremely well filmed, looked great and stayed true to year it was set in."
7886,"To be honest, Sightseers isn't right for many people at all; it's what you might call a niche film. With a distinct nod to earlier films such as Terrence Malick's BADLANDS (1973), it focuses on two lovers, Tina and Chris, who embark on a caravanning holiday that takes a decidedly bloody turn, as they dispose of several innocent victims. New boyfriend Chris (Steve Oram) decides to show her his world and takes her on a self - proclaimed "" erotic odyssey "" in his caravan to such wonders as the Crich Tramway Museum, Ribblehead Viaduct and, of course, Keswick Pencil Museum. If Lord of the Rings was basically an advert for New Zealand's magnificent landscape, then Sightseers does the same job for the north of England. One of the funniest, non-violent moments occurs as Tina struggles to write a note with a six - foot pencil."
7759,"The uncredited Ving Rhames afraid of the water and shooting with his leg is comical. If you are looking for a fun B - Movie, go rent Piranha 3D and just forget that this film even exist. The bedroom scene is one of the best scenes ever. Ving Rhames was back and that was just delightful. David Hasselfhoff - well, what can you say about David?"
7888,"If you do decide to see this movie, you may want to keep sharp objects like pencils out of reach because you may want to puncture your ear drums and stab your eyes out. second, it's a drama with moments of levity. There are indeed some very funny moments, many of them physical in nature, and yet never once does the humor overshadow the story's innate humanity. Although the scenes between Eisenberg and Ramos are competently written and performed, they're by far the most unnecessary and manufactured of the film. Eisenberg is able to make a couple of scenes very funny."
8050,"The free thinking soul will see that Kim Ki - duk's movies are not made to shock the audience just for the sake of it, but to show the thoughts of a brave artist, who exhibits a rare vulnerability and a frightening honesty in his approach to his subjects. Apparently she and Lee Jung - Jin, who brilliantly plays main character Gang - Do, barely knew who Kim Ki - duk was when they were asked to play the parts. He can make an audience relate to his characters even though they are immoral and almost heartless human beings, doing this with so much ease is remarkable. It is a rare quality to be able to find beauty in the most harsh places and to somehow convey this strange beauty to the screen. And maybe most important: to make the viewer emotionally gripped, while talking about universal human issues, emotions and ideas even though there are cultural differences that separate audience and filmmaker."
8051,"And the Fraternity of the participants is absolutely one of the greatest messages that comes out. There's a couple of slow moments but overall this keeps moving by portraying the toll on relationships and the character of all concerned. Double - blind tastings have as much relevance to real, hands - on restaurant work as the Zodiac does to Astronomy. Real masters, from academia, are given by juries of PhD's to acknowledge mastery over a subject of which they, as individuals, have made a contribution to knowledge. for you others, best of luck learning the 3000 grape varietals in Italy alone."
7889,"Both lead actors play their parts quite well and create an enjoyable partnership. The actors' play is much better than TV - class movies' as well. The performances can be a bit stilted, yet Tim seems to carry the whole thing on his own and makes it worth watching. Special mention to the location scout who has found some truly outstanding filming locations around the north of England to set some of the action in. 1) Unpredictable mysterious plot (gives a good ride) 2) Great cool acting (stung cool play by all, but the naive Liability) 3) Extinguished filming (lots if great angles and smart details) 4) Delightful score (sophisticated, punky and dirty, would search out several songs) 5) Classic cars (loved the use and filming of the Granada Ghia) And there's more to it."
7891,"Stand Up Guys is a true reminder of what film should be like: an entertaining experience that keeps you on your seat until the very end, and does a bit of everything else; it makes you laugh, touches you, and makes you wonder, and tops it off with theatrics that you accept delightfully. Surprisingly Val is content with it, but Doc isn't; this tension tests and strengthens their friendship further as the deadline becomes closer. This as good as it gets in the real sense, everything perfect, three great actors the mainstay of this movie, no words to describe anyone of them, Julianna Margulies a good actress herself looks wooden in comparison, though it would be unfair. What ensues is a fun romp through the city, along with the last of the trio, Hirsch (Alan Arkin), involving brothels, car chases, bars, beating up punks and breaking into stores, "" just like the good ol' days "", Hirsch says. In a diner, Val and Doc discuss their predicament, Val sees right through him, Doc coolly tries to deny it, although there's no denying his facial and vocal expressions which say otherwise."
7892,"Skillfully blending a highly personal journey into the lives of others with a journalist's overview of a world skewed by irrational fears and religious fervor, the film reveals how little has been learned from historical lessons of oppression. The parallels with other such battles are eerie, but the success of many of these past struggles leave the viewer hopeful that good will eventually triumph in this battle as well. The scenes at David's funeral, where he rescues the body from a local pastor who wanted to straighten out the LGBTI congregation, are very touching. And yet, it's the same religion both he and the bigots are in the thrall of, and equally drives them both to do good or evil, almost at random, underlining Christopher Hitchen's catchphrase that religion poisons everything, and Steven Weinberg's, that for good people to do evil, that takes religion. The courage of the local LGBTI people is amazing."
7718,"If you like Abraham Lincoln and you like Vampires then you will love this movie! But if you take it as fun movie, fulled of action / fantasy / horror scenes and as what it is then you can give it a chance. If you don't mind seeing vampires getting hacked, slashed, and bashed to death in a wide variety of ways, you'll enjoy this movie. It plays very much like a comic book movie, and it takes liberties with the facts of Lincoln's life while poking fun at some of them. It takes you and makes you part of the scenes and is recommended although some of the scenes would make the 3D a nuisance."
7760,"Almost every scene was tightly edited to show this, and the performances were deeply funny and heartbreaking. Even if you have read the book and seen the show, there are still so many wonderful idiosyncrasies that Mike Birbiglia wanted to explore before finally put his past behind him - and focus on his rising career. Mike Birbiglia who is a good comedian makes a comedy movie, is has to be good! At best you might call it a road movie, as half the movie Mike Birbiglia is driving around in a Volvo. A funny, honest, sad (but never too sad) autobiographically inspired road trip through Matt's 20's that features some wonderful performances by Lauren Ambrose, Carol Kane and James Rebhorn."
7761,"Winner of the Jury Prize and the Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival, Swedish filmmaker Malik Bendjelloul's moving documentary Searching for Sugar Man investigates the life of Rodriguez who grew up in a run - down working class area of Detroit, Michigan and worked mostly as a manual laborer, singing at night in small, smoke - filled bars. "" The film demonstrates Rodriguez' striking presence using a mix of songs, interviews with those who knew him or knew about him, animation, and archival photos. When Segerman and Bartholomew begin their investigation to uncover the mystery of Sixto Rodriguez, they take a cue from Watergate and decide to "" follow the money . "" Though his albums are said to have sold half a million records, speculation is rife with questions about what happened to the money and an interview with, Clarence Avant, the boss of Motown adds more heat than light. Though it reveals its secrets slowly, when it hits you, it is with an astonishing burst of power that you can feel in your bones."
7895,"Purchase the full extended cut when it's released in February; it'll be worth it, especially since the series is getting better with every segment released on Machinima. With David Eick and Bear McCreary mixed in the soup in this show, it will be without a question of a doubt very top notch. Pasqualino and Cotton were excellent as Adama and Coker and the action filled plot is thankfully nothing like Caprica, which was sort of boring."
7697,"The story idea was good enough but the writers tried to pack so many concepts into 127 minutes that they forgot a little character and conflict development. The story is excellent, despite minor flaws like for example Snow White running and swimming after years imprisoned in a dirty tower, and is supported by a great screenplay, magnificent cinematography and CGI and good acting. Ravenna imprisons Snow White on the Northern Tower of the castle while William, his father The Duke and a few survivors escape from the castle. The movie is good (not great, though), specially because of the visual effects and Charlize Theron acting. Charlize Theron, being the excellent villain that she is, ends up overacting and makes her role seem extremely over-dramatic."
8059,"Well, If you think this movie is anything other than the TV Animation, it will be great, exciting, and entertaining one! The music was also really good, Kuzan's song was perfect. Luffy shows great fighting ability here as he just always shown in the series. The characters shine - all of the strawhats - luffy, usopp, nami, franky, brook, chopper, sanji, zoro and robin. do you remember any of them say anything about retrieving / preventing the Dyna rocks from exploding?"
7762,"Based on the allegedly haunted Dybbuk box,' The Possession' is a fairly interesting watch, that works in parts & Jeffrey Dean Morgan Delivers A Super Performance! It's rare to see horror films with such strong performances but Kyra Sedgwick is also strong as the mother. Another strong point are the performances with Jeffrey Dean Morgan doing a fantastic job in the role of the father. Maybe the director just likes moths."
7752,"Special attention was given to verbal communications to convey meaning and a big thumbs up for that. For those of you that may not be a fan or don't know much about his work, this is really a movie to see, he brings everything to the screen. The story is fun to watch develop, full of twists and turns and witty dialogue that adds just that right amount of sarcasm to intense situations. A lot of people have complained about the ending (or multiple endings) and the ability to predict some of the plot twists, like, before the prologue. Also, for Reines to be such a highly trained and alert Secret Service agent, he was often too naive in certain circumstances when even Stevie Wonder would have seen the writing on the wall."
7898,"The beauty contestants believe they can achieve all that they want, and if successful, will have fame, fortune and influence, but are also victims of objectification, sexism, and unrealistic beauty standards. They often have to receive Botox treatments to look "" perfect "", and this is done by actually measuring their facial features to the tenth of cm. There are two' camps' contrasted in the film: One for future beauty - queens, complete with fashion advisers, make - up artists, publicists, photographers, etc. that prepare contestants for the Miss India contest; and one for girls with' traditional Hindu values' to prepare them for life. Many Indian girls aspire to become models, Bollywood actresses and ultimately Miss India."
7899,"If you are interested in finding more about their brutalities and violence, you can find videos in youtube recently, they are involved in a riot with other organization and Police. After over one - hundred years of cinema, it's pretty rare to come across a film unlike anything you've seen before, let alone one that begs the question: how the hell did they pull that off? What begins as a glimpse into the lives of a handful of former death squad leaders, Oppenheimer then invites them to help produce fictional recreations of their killings, recreations mimicking the style of the murderers' favourite Hollywood movies. Damning as it is, Oppenheimer's surreal world also acts as an arena for' art' therapy, treatment both logical and plausible for men who've been playing roles their whole lives. It is shocking to see these men proudly celebrating their monstrous crimes, including rape."
7900,"The film works in that if gets you thinking at times, but there are other times where you roll your eyes. If you're looking for a couple of fan theories that will tickle your brain and that you can kind of chuckle at, or if you're looking to make fun of fan obsession, there's something in this film for you. This is a fun film for moviehounds to debate afterwards over coffee, but for a more informative view of The Shining, get the Warners Kubrick DVD box - set, which has five of his stunning movies, but also Vivian Kubrick's terrific on - set documentary and Jan Harlan's excellent A Life In Pictures film. At any rate, going back to the three biggest conspiracy theories, which by the way, can't all be right at the same time â€“ or maybe, Kubrick laid these breadcrumbs for fools to follow so he can be further amused when he was alive, the Native American one was the most obvious. It reveals little about Kubrick's vision or intent and everything about their specific and sometimes downright crazy views about the world as expressed through their interpretations of Kubrick's movie."
7751,"This one's a keeper for him but the real star of this movie is Zach Galifianakis who seems to replicate Jack Black's character in "" Bernie "" but with a completely different take. He shines in romantic comedies like Meet the Parents but he is trying to hard to make a Will Farrell film. If your a fan of both Will Ferrell and Zach Galifanakis comedies you will definitely love the Campaign. Chris Henchy & Shawn Harwell's Screenplay is funny & crisp. The film's pacing is very good and the chemistry between Farrell And Galifianakis is just perfect."
7902,"Great musical score by Cherilyn MacNeil and The Major Minors. This day is filled with several episodes in which director Jan - Ole Gerster manages to portrait the various aspects of life in modern Berlin - whether its the Kafkaesque bureaucracy one has to deal with on a daily basis or the never - ending struggle to find normality in the midst of hipsterdom and self - proclaimed avantgarde attitude which makes Berlin so popular amongst party people all over the world. Jan - Ole Gerster's "" Oh, Boy, "" which is called in America, "" A Coffee in Berlin, "" is one of the most gorgeously cinematographed or filmed movies of all time, the stills from which could be framed separately as photo - masterpieces, one after another--in the hundreds if not thousands of them--and then displayed in a museum, simply as a succession of photographic masterpieces; but this is instead a motion picture, in which, additionally, the script, acting, casting, musical score, and, of course (doesn't it naturally follow from all those) the direction, are literally breathtaking, and the total impression from that profusion of artistic brilliance left this viewer deeply moved. If you want directorial comparisons, the movies of the great director Guy Madden, and the two great movies from David Lynch, can be compared with this one, for their haunting effects and deeply offbeat and surprising turns of script and for their images which (like this one's) burn themselves into one's consciousness at a deep enough level to become a permanent feature of a receptive viewer's being. Gerster's professors might be proud, but viewers expecting a good movie are bound to be seriously disappointed."
7765,"The most plainly excellent detail is that the plot is perfectly paced; in this respect it outdoes both Bridesmaids and The Hangover, the two films most frequently compared to it. Bridesmaids relied too heavily on Kristen Wiig's (admittedly hilarious) performance, while comparatively ignoring several other potentially interesting characters. The Hangover, while better than Bridesmaids, lacked the impressive dramatic pacing and humane camaraderie (as well as the outstanding cast) that bolsters Bachelorette. There was a wedding, two of the three leads end up in relationships, the transcendence of love is affirmed. Gena and Katie still have serious emotional issues to work over, and their relationships are far from stable or long - lasting."
7696,"The Smith & Jones pairing is augmented by Brolin who gives a good representation of how K would be in the Sixties, with most of the sequences accompanied by popular Sixties hits on the soundtrack. But the fun action sequences with some exciting futuristic vehicles and weaponry, the imaginative and repulsive aliens made by no less than the master monster - maker Rick Baker, the thrilling integration of the historic Apollo 11 lift - off, and the touching revelation of K's big secret made this a very good and enjoyable movie to watch. The time travel storyline should have been brilliant - this was when space / alien mania took off, the birthplace of nutty conspiracy theories combined with swinging sixties free loving, trippy hippy, bring your own bong culture, Get Smart gadgets and a man trying to save the world while being black! In this sequel, it's pretty small and unnecessary but it still has the charms and bright imagination."
7904,"She charms the viewer with the common everyday struggles of the Saudi woman, and rather than address the issues in a combative way, her approach is warm, even cute. Wadjad's truly beautiful mother spends much of her time perfecting her appearance only then to have to then cover herself with a full hijab. To collect 800 riyals (price of bike), she decides to compete in Quran competition to win 1000 riyals. Filmed on location in Saudi Arabia, a feat in itself in a country that does not have a film industry as films are considered sinful, Wadjda's desire represents the wish for female freedom; her lack of a bicycle is mirrored in the adult women's inability to drive, prohibited for women in Saudi Arabia, and the problems this creates for them. Wadjda is a hero in any culture."
8072,"0 movies are good anime, with the limitation of the time to tell the history, but retelling the original plot clearly. Aside for some visual nods to Kubrick's work (2001: A Space Odyssey, in particular), Hideaki Anno produces a visual wonder through animation, as he has with the previous Evangelion entries (and the parallels between NGE and Rebuild, in their universe hand - offs, progressions, and quantum entanglements), and goes above and beyond. Although the story certainly spans all for movies, this felt like a baby step compared to the leaps and bounds that were 1. It is a different story, but it's more of the genius Anno building on the core concepts that made Evangelion the classic it is. The first two "" rebuilds "" of Evangelion crammed twenty episodes of the 1995 Shin Seiki Evangelion TV series into a span of three and a half hours, upping the musical and animation ante every explosive step of the way."
7776,"The movie deals with an interesting idea of the leader vs. the soldier, master vs. slave. There is also some great supporting work from Laura Dern and others. Unquestionably P. T. Anderson's best film so far. Dodd's "" freedom "" from mastery is wholly dependent on the worship of the other, an other outstandingly represented by Phoenix's Freddie Quell, a potentially unbreakable "" scoundrel "" who Dodd both fears and admires as such. Quell is a completely, irredeemably, broken individual, whose only surviving qualities are sheer animal instinct - screw, eat, and drink."
7766,"In fact, from the non-stop laughs, to the quite satirical teenage dialogue, to the perfectly hilarious "" Best in Show "" - esque banter from Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins, who play the two commentators of the national a cappella competition, "" Pitch Perfect "", aside from a curiously abrupt ending, works on EVERY level; even in its rarest of sappy moments. Take Bring It On, Glee (not in the icky cheesy way, but because there's singing involved, the good kind), Mean Girls, and add some quick - witted, sharp - tongued dialogue and commentary, and you have the funniest of movies. "" Pitch Perfect "" vs. "" Glee "": The main reason "" Pitch Perfect "" works so well is actually quite simple. It's the "" group of teen misfits who band together and win a competition "" movie. For Pitch Perfect, that other better film is The Breakfast Club, which the 2D heroine's would - be 2D boyfriend regards as the most meaningful thing ever."
7730,"The new idea is that Parker can hear the movements of spiders and it's a good addition. This is a solid entry into the superhero genre despite really offering anything new. The inclusion of Dr. Curt Connors / The Lizard was long overdue and was played adequately by Rhys Ifans, Martin Sheen and Sally Field were great as Uncle Ben and Aunt May as was Dennis Leary's Captain Stacy. The important scenes where Peter gets bitten or hones his skills or makes his suit have been hurried and short, while the irrelevant scenes have been dragged. It also lead to a superior sequel and the much maligned, though underrated, third episode."
7767,"Even 2012 provided dozens much better action movies. the thing is though, is that they are doing a lot of movies along this same line. It plods along amiably enough for much of its length until the film's highlight, around 16 minutes from the end: a very well executed and imaginative car chase sequence."
7750,"Hacking can be done well; goldeneye, swordfish, diehard4. For a film that happens to be the 23rd installment in a movie franchise, the latest James Bond thriller, Skyfall, is surprisingly original. The plot of Skyfall as written is simple, absolutely nailed on it is straight and true to Hollywood conventions, but what fills out the simple plot is a series of Bondian delights, thrills spills and emotionally splintered kills. The result is the uniquely named' Skyfall' a Bond film so full of the vintage charm and charisma yet fashioned in modern, urban and instantly accessible style that it ends up being one of the finest films of the franchise. ' Skyfall' fortunately, is a film that reaches up to that caliber."
7692,"Tim Burton is probably one of the best choices to direct a Dark Shadows movie. It's actually pretty good at recapturing the 70's. Even the music, which is all of the 70's era, is perfect for the movie. There are twists everywhere and it doesn't matter if you catch them or not. The sets and costumes are excellent as is the cinematography."
7769,"Sitting here the day after viewing Rian Johnson's Looper, parts of it are still falling in to place. Women are passive objects to be both lusted and tortured. The only action scene worthy of the name comes in the last 5 minutes where Bruce Willis suddenly turns ninja and takes out ALL the bad guys in about 30 seconds, and then walks off. Looper's first thirty minutes run by smoothly. At a time when other worthwhile films slip into obscurity of small openings and DVD bargain bins."
7910,"Mr. Korine is a strangely unique director that uses this film to bore you into understanding how a generation growing up with MTV and girls gone wild has deeply mutilated the pursuit of happiness with nihilistic extremity â€” however his satirical exploration leaves you uncertain whether to laugh, cry out in horror, or stare in disbelief at its overwhelmingly artistic beauty. The four girls do a decent job, the most notable being Selena Gomez although her character wasn't in it for a lot of the highly regarded scenes. Spring Breakers is a unique experience featuring lots of depth and style. Spring Breakers is going to cause a lot of disagreement regardless. They think week long drinking binges, whoring themselves out, and having no goals is cool, because YOLO."
7770,"This is Adam Sandler at his raunchiest and funniest. As a fan of movies such as Wedding Crashers, Old School, Step Brothers, 21 Jump Street, Superbad, and Forgetting Sarah Marshall just to name a few, this has to be the funniest movie out of the bunch. Had good feeling, good comedy, a solid entry to Sandlers recent works. The only laughs to be found come from, not a main character, but one that shows up at the end of the film (something you should expect from a Happy Madison picture). The bachelor party scenes are epic, really feel for the characters."
7717,"And at a time when so many comedies are aimed only at 15 year olds, even 2nd tier Woody, simply telling playfully comic tales, is a welcome sight. Some highlights are particularly appreciated though: first of all Alec Baldwin's character, then Penelope Cruz's, the "" newly - weds story "" (which was sufficient by itself to give a shade of Italian Comedy,) and finally the splendid photography. But on the other hand the movie is filled with a sensation of horror vacui that makes it a bit heavy and prolix (which is uncommon in Woody Allen). Knowing the outstanding results Mr Allen has achieved in portraying human troubles and tragedies, one is left with the curiosity to know how he would have managed to portray (or allude to) the tragicomic current events that Italian reality abundantly offers. As time passes Woody Allen is able to transform himself and his movies."
7913,"Beautiful (literally) characters, witty dialogues, good background score and decent acting make this a great option for the rom - com genre fans. Ronny is one or two years older, this, obviously, makes him wiser, more attuned to the ways of the world, and anybody who isn't him, or who hasn't gone to college, will just never understand the devastations that corporations cause. It's a mature film in its depiction of teenagers; it works for adults just as well it does for its teen audience. The dialogue is a little unnatural at times, and some parts of the story are more drawn out than they need to be, but it's fairly easy to forgive that. "" The First Time "" is a light romantic drama; easy to watch and enjoy, especially for fans of teen romantic comedies of any age."
7914,""" The Place Beyond the Pines "" is the second feature film with the director / actor pair of Derek Cianfrance and Ryan Gosling. The two together are a two man wrecking force who show resemblance of a DiCaprio / Scorsese dynamic. In this film, they tackle an ambitious, emotional and completely original tale about fathers and sons, sins of the father, generational consequences, and how one moment can send shockwaves lasting a lifetime. The actors really own their roles and allow for the viewers to connect with the portrayal of their sympathetic characters. The story here is ambitious and succeeds in telling a new and refreshing tale that filmgoers have not seen or experienced on this level of deep sophistication in ages."
7915,"What made it "" enthusiastically quirky "" was just the overall way it was conducted, with characters with enigma and personality, and a storyline that you wouldn't believe would be interesting after fifty minutes. It has a couple of laughs, partial nudity, a lot of intimate moments, and you don't really have to pay attention. Sooooo, that sounds like an interesting plot doesn't it? And there were also moments throughout the movie that were great and funny. It was a terrific motion picture in terms of tone, character development, and setting, but also, took on the challenge of humanizing a rather genial character doing the truly despicable."
7719,"A good couple of chuckles in there, and if you're over 35 years old. But, if you like the 80's and its music, you will probably enjoy this movie and leave with a smile. With so much rubbish coming out of Hollywood to keep the nay - sayers busy with their critical reviews, this is a refreshing change. Tom Cruise is a hoot in his role (think Axl Rose) and the others weren't bad either. Just sit back, take it with a grain of salt, and enjoy, the very nicely mixed - into - medley 80's Rock 'n Roll hits; all extravagantly presented for your entertainment."
7690,"Any way the love making scenes were very good so if you are just going for the romance you won't be disappointed. The plot is very simple and predictable, but the chemistry among Zac Efron, Taylor Schilling, Blythe Danner and the boy Riley Thomas Stewart makes the film worth. She's Beth (Taylor Schilling), who works at the kennel, is a single mother to her seven - year - old son, Ben (Riley Thomas Stewart), and shares the home with her mother (Blythe Danner, who gives the most interesting performance in the film). "" The Lucky One "" is a sweet and dramatic romance, with pleasant characters. There seems to be a consistent trend in the movies based on Nicholas Sparks' romance novels."
7720,"Very similar to Bill Murray's character in "" Lost In Translation "", Carell is great at conveying so much despite doing so little. Knightley serves as a great contrast to Carell in many ways, and she is a welcome presence in this movie. The film evolves into a sort of road - trip movie when a riot ensues outside their apartment building, and Dodge persuades Penny to drive to Somerset, Delaware because he knows someone who owns an airplane. It's great that in a summer season of action flicks and disaster films, there's one film that takes its time showing how ordinary people react to extraordinary things. Besides Carell and Knightley, other fairly well - known actors show up so briefly, their appearances could practically be considered cameos."
7772,"Frank resists mightily at first, but soon Frank improves remarkably and takes up his earlier vocation: stealing jewels. A subplot involves Frank's daughter Madison (Liv Tyler), who works on - location in Turkmenistan, coming to visit him shortly after Hunter gives him the robot, to show that human - care is the best care of all and that robots cannot provide a human with the same kind of love a human can. It delivers first - rate performances by first - rate actors. Best of all is Peter Sarsgaard (Jarhead, Garden State) who brings a perfect sense of comedy and real life validation as the voice of the robot. Many of the film's ideas and actions, such as humanizing a burglar, constructing a believable world where robots have become dependable caregivers, and injecting a very small love story, all work with the gentle direction of Jake Schreier and the thoughtful, sympathetic writing by Christopher D. Ford."
8095,"And having such a high ratings on here and not hearing about all those potential Oscars that go with such a high rating film is just more proof that things are not what they seem. During the years that past while Mack is behind the prison walls Molloy's near fatal heart attack gives him a wake up call and he cleans up his act and moves in with a lovely woman who owns a women's clothing store. It's not the best timing with Liotta, close to proposing to his new love, Vanessa Gray, one of the better performers. Yeah, it has a few' highlight' moments which are worth. 7 rating by having friends and family of the director, producer and others to cast a good vote."
7773,"It was beautiful and frighteningly ugly to see Ai Weiwei's story. Ai Weiwei was depicted as a bright, articulate, and talented man who wanted to make things better for the next generation as he felt his father's generation failed him. Internet shutdowns lead to Ai Weiwei utilizing Twitter to communicate each and every step of his drama. Ai Weiwei wants the citizens of China to have that same freedom. The documentary was very rich with interview like local culture blogger, colleague, friend, wife, son's mother, mother and himself."
7774,"Fans like that sort of thing "" Paul S. Anderson - "" Sounds good, Done! Honestly if you enjoyed all the former movies and you consider them "" part of their own story "" meaning that your pretty much ignoring the video games when watching the movies then you'll find yourself even more amazed by how terrible this movie is. Viewers hoping for a coherent narrative are advised to try Capcom's Resident Evil cartoons; viewers completely new to the series really have no choice but to let the images simply break over them like tsunamis. No more mutant dead dogs, thank goodness, although Anderson remains overly - fond of his tentacles - bursting - out - of - the - mouth shots. "" Paul S. Anderson - "" Sounds good, OK people let's make this movie."
7954,"The casting was also pretty accurate; Maddy, Rita, Lana, Goldie, Marianne, and V. V. were more or less accurately chosen in their portrayals and in the physical looks of the girls, and the acting was adequate. Legs's baby sister was never born, and Legs's love and concern for her sister was a large part of what drove her to want to kidnap Kellogg in the first place - to be able to get enough money to provide for her and the rest of Foxfire. With so many lousy films and independent attempts that are failures, it was a pleasure to be rewarded with this viewing. The pros of the 2014 film, It is a lot closer to the book, except two or three scenes that were in the weren't in the film, (which may be a good thing) The cons of the 2014 film, Goldie is a lot less likable in the 2014 film vs the 1996 film, the tattoo scene in the 2014 film is non-nude. Violet in the movie is pretty and well put together, controlled and quiet, and she certainly didn't have the emotional outbursts and dramatics of the Violet in the book."
7829,""" A Fantastic Fear of Everything "" is an incredibly well - done film from start to finish. A Fantastic Fear of Everything is one of those films that you just need to sit back, watch, and just enjoy the film for what it is. A Fantastic Fear of Everything is probably not what you're expecting from Simon Pegg. A Fantastic Fear of Everything is far from being a perfect movie but it's a solid, enthralling film that hints at the possibility of Crispian Mills becoming a very fine filmmaker indeed and a hero of the off - kilter cinephiles who are tired of Tim Burton's ever - downward spiral and in need of someone new to rely on for their fix of surrealism. The absolute star of A Fantastic Fear of Everything is Crispian Mills and it has nothing to do with him being son of Hayley, grandson of Sir John, nephew of Maxwell Caulfield or lead singer of Kula Shaker, although it's all interesting trivia."
7544,"The movie features an ensemble cast that includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd, and Samuel L. Jackson. Robert Downey Jr. does a good job as a Iron Man he has a lot of good moments when he talks with Loki. In the third act he did a lot of cool stuff, he is cool with arrows. In the film, Nick Fury, director of the peacekeeping organization S. H. I. E. L. D., recruits Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, and Thor to form a team that must stop Thor's brother Loki from subjugating Earth. It was entertaining, the CGI was really good, Robert Downey Jr. had a lot funny moments and hilarious dialogues."
7600,"One of them is Momoa (the only actor with weirder eyebrows than Sly), who killed Sly's partner and now has kidnapped Sly's daughter, played by the lovely Sarah Shahi. Or a delightfully funny moment where Jason Momoa's head pops out of a scuzzy pond, like something from a 1950s science - fiction flick. Jason Momoa is decent as the killer. It also pits Stallone in a classic axe fight with Jason Momoa (of' STARGATE: ATLANTIS',' BAYWATCH' and' GAME OF THRONES' fame. Kang makes a great sidekick and Momoa is an awesome bad guy."
7601,"The biggest misstep this film has is the motivation behind the revenge. Crews and Courture again get short shifted and feel like background characters. Other than this, the movies deserve a 3 star rating, and this is generous considering that the director of the movie just bashed all the characters head on raw concrete with his amazingly stupid script. Suffice to say Sylvester Stallone has once again saved action movies and put the meat back on the bone. There is a scene in The Expendables 2 where they have cleared out a small church filled with Van Damme's cronies and only one enemy is left."
7689,"The plot revolves around the love lives and relationships of six male friends who fall into very specific roles; the player, the mamas boy, the dreamer, the non-commiter, the happily married man and the happy divorcÃ©e. The main cast are pretty diverse in their personalities so most people will be able to relate to someone in the movie, but even if you can't it's got enough comedy / fun in it to keep you entertained. It was funny, charming, and full of really great moments. The cast is beautiful, the emotions are spot - on all through the film."
7775,"She lives in New York City, she is working on her PhD thesis, and she is about to marry her dreamy - looking boyfriend of years. Enter the classic coming - of - age, finding yourself stuff, the "" choosing to be alive "" as Lola phrases it. Lola's dreamy life in NYC comes to an abrupt halt when she's dumped by her fiancÃ©. Greta Gerwig is enchanting in the lead role, and her delightful comedic mannerisms and facial expressions are perfect for this wry comedy. Lola (Greta Gerwig) To watch Greta Gerwig play the eponymous Lola dealing with the cancellation of her wedding 3 weeks before the event by her cold - footed boyfriend, Luke (Joel Kinneman), is to watch a young, already accomplished actress deftly play a doctoral student navigating the emotional potholes of breaking up."
7704,"The two young leads are superb and the brave move by Anderson to place unknown actors front and centre pays off beautifully. A touch here and a touch there are more than enough to paint a picture of a group of people who are eerily similar in their dissatisfaction with their lives and yet react quite differently to the two young lovers' dash (literally) for happiness. While the two of them head off into the wilderness of Suzy's twelve mile long home island a search party that includes Island Policeman Bruce Willis, Scout leader Edward Norton, Suzy's parents Bill Murray and Frances McDormand and Sam's fellow Scouts set about trying to hunt the eloping children down in the days preceding a huge storm. All of this is established in one long sequence of beautiful camera movements which last no longer than a couple of minutes. There is a vague pastel and brown tint to everything which matches the film's period setting."
7688,"A few funny moments, but problems of both pacing and tone are fatal, as are the silly Brit stereotypes, the silly Jewish stereotypes, the silly "" clueless straight guy "" stereotypes. The serious' truths' of being in a relationship take center stage, which is in itself not a bad thing, but in a comedy, it really drags the film down. This is partially because the film, while billed as a romantic comedy, is only funny in spurts. With all of the great scripts that can't get funding, what genius gave this poor attempt at comedy the green light? There are risks when romantic comedy is injected with "" truth . """
7777,"Megacity 1 is made markedly less futuristic than the comic in order to become so believable that it is hard to tell where the real slums of Cape Town end and the CGI kilometre high city blocks start. The effect is striking and believable, like everything else in this film. The director did a great job on the city and you really feel like it is a corrupt and decadent city where law enforcement officers can judge, jury and execute criminals on the spot. The 3D affects were surprisingly good for once with the slow motion affects and this is coming from someone who is not fond of 3D. Now a low key British film company has had another crack at bringing Dredd to the silver screen, and the result is a great science fiction action film that holds no punches and gives the audience a gritty, gory and surprisingly relatable take on the comic book hero."
7602,"Most of the tributes have never had enough to eat and this is a major factor in the Games. This movie is yet another in a long line of Hollywood ripoffs of really great foreign movies - Contraband and Dragon Tattoo being just two other examples. Hollywood has long since lost any creative talent it once had and is now reduced to comic book movies, third remakes of movies and television series not that good to begin with and really awful ripoffs of very good foreign movies. There is a lot of similar movies (TV show that will be survived only by the sole victor) and every single of them is more thrilling. This film follows 16 - year old Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) of District 12, an expert archer, who volunteers to take her younger sister's place in the games."
7604,"From the beginning to the end you have some very beautiful and emotional scenes like the mob fight between the police and the thugs, the rise of the Batman from the prison and the chants "" Deshi Deshi Basura Basura "" towards the end where Alfred and Bruce see each other for probably the last time and both know that he has made it. Extremely well editing and sound use really develop many of the movie's action scenes, so it's not just explosions and visuals like in many other movies. With cool gadgets, fast - paced chase and fight scenes, complex characters, and a story line that will keep you on the edge of your seat, fans of the Batman series will not be disappointed. No longer a dunderhead "" enforcer "", but one of the criminal masterminds behind "" Gotham's Reckoning "", coupled with a physical dominance strong enough to send shivers down your spine. In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie - going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment."
7685,"There are some TERRIBLE comic scenes, like the one where the guy is stealing a burrito for his bigtittied trophy. Neeson is decent as the admiral or whatever, and even Rihanna does an acceptable job."
7605,"While little could be done to cushion the drop in quality that was bound to come with well, anything, that followed that near - masterpiece of action, Jeremy Renner makes an apt substitute and the thrills, wit and set pieces are all top notch, even if it won't quite have audiences asking, "" Jason who? "" Taking place almost at the same time of the climax of the third Bourne film (Ultimatum), this film deals with the fall out of the exposure of "" Operation Blackbriar "" and how an another agency with in the government is trying to cover up their program in order not to be caught up with the coming scandal create by Jason Bourne. What makes this movie watchable is NOTHING but the performance of the lead actors, Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz. "" Outcome "", the program in question is an offshoot of both "" Treadstone "" and "" Blackbriar "" but with a huge difference, they are tabbing into science to create super agents that are faster and stronger than any other agent before them. Renner and Weisz are absolutely perfect in their roles."
7922,"Additionally, Dark Tide perfectly captured the sense of sheer peace and quiet that consumes you once your head is below the waves in the open ocean. If Great White Sharks thrill you and you like Ocean stories you will enjoy this one. The story is realistic, unlike others like "" Deep Blue Sea "" this one is not a Hollywood exaggeration. Cimatography is excellent in Dark Tide. If you fear the idea of swimming with Great White Sharks out in the open ocean of South Africa, you will be biting your nails and holding your seat."
7779,"Training Day, The Fast and the Furious, Dark Blue and S. W. A. T. all showcase his passion for writing screenplays about these streets and the role that police officers play in them. This topic has been covered countless times but what makes End Of Watch different â€“ and better â€“ then many of its predecessors is that it holds realism as its number one priority. This is one of the most realistic portrayals of police life ever put to celluloid. Gyllenhaal continues to solidify himself as one of the best actors around and PeÃ±a delivers one of his best performances to date. "" End of Watch "" is a police drama film written and directed by David Ayer, who has worked on a number of police - related movies in the past as either the writer, director, or both, including "" S. W. A. T "" and "" Street Kings ""."
7684,"This movie was entertaining for any age, full of action, surprises and humor. This film is charming and delightful, and has a number of surprises, some of which are a treat (the poisoned apple, and the musical ending, to name but two). Armie Hammer, who was really good in "" The Social Network "", delivers a horrid performance as the Prince, not by judging his acting, but by judging those completely forced moments he was asked to be in. Somehow with the help of the dwarfs and the Prince (Armie Hammer), Snow White begins to believe in herself and realizes she has the strength to fight off the wicked Queen. Love the dwarfs, they had absolutely the best one liners."
7618,"Keke Palmer is just awesome as Latifahs daughter. an awesome mix of comedy and music it has a very glee feel to it and Dolly is in top form as is Queen Latifah though they are over shadowed at times by the younger stars. There were some laughs, some moving plot points, some great musical numbers, and some fine performances, particularly on the part of the younger cast members. The gospel music and contemporary pop made it appealing to all ages."
7624,"Seeing Worthington as an ex-NY cop, ex-convict and Banks as a negotiator / psychologist with a past is surprising on paper but they manage to pull it off very well. Overall, it's a good enough movie for people who like these kinds of movies. Worthington, Banks, Bell and the rest do the best with their parts though and it's nice to see Worthington continue to branch out a little. In Sing Sing Correctional Facility, the ex-cop Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) is informed that his appeal was denied by the court. Go see it if you like action / thriller movies!"
7926,"Then the most enjoyable parts begin with lots of laughs until the approach of the end where it brings lots of emotions before concluding with a powerful howl. "" Wolf Children "" is his third feature after the successes of "" The Girl Who Leaped Through Time "" and "" Summer Wars "". It's not of the same scale as Hosoda's previous Summer Wars or The Girl Who Leapt through Time, but it packs an emotional punch that surpasses either of them. In the vein of films like Totoro, and in contrast to Mamoru Hosoda's previous Summer Wars, this film glides along without an epic struggle driving the story. The story is almost too ordinary, but in its normality, its moments are universal."
7780,"Let it be known, that it's strictly boobs--and stealing creepy tapes--from here on out. V / H / S brings the format into the new age by unfolding its tales by wrapping around the latest craze of found footage. However in a few of the tapes the mystery is strong enough to keep you interested and some of the tension is pretty thrilling, although it never really pays off. It wasn't anything spectacular, but it was enjoyable and well written."
7781,"Co-written with Tobias Lindholm, this is an ambitious star vehicle for legendary actor Mads Mikkelsen, an icon in Denmark and familiar face around the world as well. At its heart the story is ultimately a powerful comment on prejudice, based on true incidents, that may leave you emotionally drained but truly moved. Among the children, Annika Wedderkopp's portrayal of Klara is frighteningly brilliant. Natural lighting is used to match the heights and depths of the kindergarten children's emotions. Backed independently by Swedish and Danish production companies, director Vinterberg actually intended to set and shoot the picture in Canada but better tax incentives and financing led him back to his native country of Denmark."
7782,"Don't expect this story of a man (a fully committed Denis Lavant) taking on 9 different personas in a day in Paris to make any neat logical sense, this is a film of dreams and ideas - music, madness, death, sex, despair and comedy. The delight is in the individual scenes, though some of the scenarios have a real sadness to them: the motion capture scene, where human movement proves spellbinding in a way that CGI can never be; the sad tale of the daughter returning home after a party; the wonderfully crazed and uncomfortable Eva Mendes segment (make sure you check out the writing on the gravestones); and the surprisingly dramatic scene featuring pop icon Kylie Minogue (whose other film appearances were never anything like this). Even for the sheer beauty of the shots, which combine the technical precision of someone who truly understands lighting and optics with the poetic abstraction of a surrealist painting, this film is worth watching. Finding beauty or love in something and enjoying it is always a lovely and inspired reaction for anyone to have to anything, regardless of how others feel about it. Holy Motors is a thrilling, darkly comic and bonkers film that is worth tracking down."
7632,"He just makes his CGI airplanes do anything he wants them to do to fit his fantasies and fiction. But for an "" historical "" movie like this claims to be, Chuck Jones could have made cartoon Mustangs imitating the Road Runner and cartoon Messerschmitts imitating Wile E. Coyote and his Acme gadgets, and they wouldn't have been any more technically inaccurate. The promise in RED TAILS fictionally given by Colonel Bullard (actually a thinly disguised version of the real - life Colonel Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.) to reduce bomber losses by 70 - 80% was in real life fulfilled by all American fighter pilots in the European Theater. Characters that had no place being there, in particular the Italian love interest of one of the pilots. The only flight sequences which are realistic are the landing and take - off scenes."
7783,"For this to be Mara Brock Akil and her husband's very first feature film together, the script was very well written. It had a lot of memorable one liners and great comebacks. Jordin Sparks did very well as Sparkle. Derek Luke was solid and Tika Sumpter was awesome. The vocals were good but of course Whitney Houston dominated in that department being that she is one of the greatest voices to ever walk this Earth."
7634,"On par with most romantic comedies and even better than some. An R rating with a few swearing felons would have been a bit more realistic, especially since the sexual situations are more than a 13 - year - old should be watching and the storyline definitely adult. On opening weekend (with the $6 groupon) the theater was full and the audience was seated throughout and laughing regularly. One for the Money has a lot more going for it, predominantly being a film written by and made by females for its intended audience, and being an engaging flick chick that wonderfully encapsulates a whodunnit. Katherine Heigl seems to be on a successful roll on celluloid, and is in her element here in this romantic action adventure comedy as lead character Stephanie Plum, a rookie bounty hunter drawn to the profession only because she's desperate for a job to pay off impending bills."
7931,"It's a real movie about people, and a place--not car chases and explosions. Keeping his respectful gaze on rural America, Nichols creates an intimate reflection on friendship, unrequited love, and youthful discovery with a rhythmic, sensitive approach towards life's realizations during childhood. The film unveils its inner soul with a purposefully meditative pace that might deter some from experiencing a thoughtful approach but that would be a drastic mistake because it's one of the more authentically creative and emotionally opulent movies to grace the theaters in a long while. The cast works extremely well together under Nichols' direction with McConaughey delivering an Oscar worthy performance as a troubled man hiding out on an island in the Mississippi River who is discovered by two young teenage boys (Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland in two winning performances). An exquisite piece of filmmaking from writer - director Jeff Nichols, bolstered by powerful performances from Matthew McConaughey, Reece Witherspoon, Sam Shephard, Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland."
7636,"Chronicle is an engaging offspring of two very separate genres. Never would you have imagined a super hero origins movie being shot with a hand - held camera. Dane DeHaan, Alex Russell, Michael B. Jordan give great, convincing performances. Throughout the years, audiences have been treated to origin stories such as those based on superheroes. Directed by Joe Trank, "" Chronicle "" tells the story of three friends who gain superpowers from a mysterious tunnel discovered in a remote part of a suburban town."
7784,Mostly people in USA drive Automatic cars and the girl didn't pass driving test 2 times but The girl drives a manual car perfectly in Turkey.
7642,"Matt escapes with Tobin and he contacts the CIA senior management Harlan Whitford (Sam Shepard), David Barlow (Brendan Gleeson) and Catherine Linklater (Vera Farmiga) that give instruction to Matt to reach another safe house with the prisoner. "" Safe House "" is a conventional but effective action - thriller with the usual shootings, car chases and explosions. But the great cast, with the charismatic Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds; great veteran actors Brendan Gleeson and Sam Shepard; the always excellent Vera Farmiga; and the gorgeous and unknown Nora Arnezeder, makes the difference. The Hollywoodian commercial happy end is unrealistic but certainly will pleasure a great number of viewers. "" but getting past that means enjoying a film where Denzel Washington perfectly menaces and charms his way through every scene."
7643,"In her mind, as Leo says in one of the trailers for this movie, she's still engaged to her ex-fiancÃ©. The only emotional part of the movie was the scene with Paige (McAdams' character) interacting with her mom near the end of the movie. For a story that seems tailor - made to be a tug at your heartstrings, tearjerker kind of movie (and it's inspired by an actual story of a woman who loses her memory of her husband after a car crash and falls in love with him all over again, so how could this miss?) Vow, based on a true story, was decent rom - com which had some fine moments to sustain you through the entire film coupled by good performances and good storyline. There were plenty of cute moments that make you say, "" ahhhhhh . """
8539,"Lets hope someone can eventually make a gay romantic comedy with the quality of a You've Got Mail or a classic like Charade. But perhaps that would have been of better use if the interiors were less Ikea showroom, and a bit more more lush. Certainly a film for the steadfast romantic who believes true love conquers all, the premise is outrageous then unfolds with a series of farcical scenes climaxing with "" the moment of knowing . "" This makes a concerted effort to be a unique and original sex comedy, with the sexy scenes and the off - color banter a mainstream romantic comedy would have had."
8198,"Pascal and especially Max were hilarious as they ran around the kingdom trying to catch the wedding rings. Eugene's horse and Rapunzel's chameleon carry their rings. It is beautifully animated, the sceneries are not as stunning as those of Tangled but they are still beautiful, it all looks very colourful and the characters are very well modelled. The music is suitably jaunty, the writing is delightfully witty with Eugene's dialogue at the start very amusing especially regarding his nose and the sight gags with Pascal and Maximus are hilarious, very couple - of - laughs - a-minute. But the stars of the show are Eugene whose lines are wonderfully droll with his personality here sticking true to that of Tangled, and Maximus who proves that a character can steal the show without saying a word."
8071,"Granted, none of the actors were in danger of an Oscar nomination, but the characters were believable and got you involved in the story, the clichÃ©s were kept to a minimum, and most importantly, the atmosphere and the scares worked, and they held up to repeated viewings. Any of the jumpy scenes could easily have been chucked in from the first. Grave Encounters wasn't all that original a found footage horror but, The Vicious Brothers did have some clever fun with the conventions and made an entertaining and spooky tale of a crew of a paranormal investigation show coming up against something they can't handle at an abandoned insane asylum. Encounters 2 takes The Blair Witch 2 route and makes it a film about the film. Some of the scares were the same from the first movie which took away from the surprise factor."
7646,"Lauren's sudden unemployment coupled with the good head on her shoulders sparks her idea to help Katie launch her own sex phone hotline. Cameo's with Seth Rogen and Kevin Smith were hilarious. While Ari Graynor has the better role to play, Lauren Miller manages to prove she shares a sense of lowbrow humour with her husband (Rogen), who cameos in one of the film's most memorable scenes. The other well - documented cameo with Seth Rogen isn't nearly as funny because it is also supposed to serve as plot advancement. Earlier this summer, the male stripper movie "" Magic Mike "" turned into a rather nice surprise as it became a quarter - life crisis dramedy."
7647,"Overall: probably good for kids, probably good for drunk adults, most likely awful to everyone that noticed how the movie industry is on a downfall, and how each year it gets worse. "" Journey 2: The Mysterious Island "" is a blue - screen CGI extravaganza that is mixed in with the picturesque Hawaii locations, but containing a plot that is essentially all told in the trailer and presented with the dynamics of an amusement park tour. "" Journey 2: The Mysterious Island "" is a movie with a trailer that is better than the film itself. The previews for Journey 2: The Mysterious Island made it look better than it actually was. Dwayne "" The Rock "" Johnson and Josh Hutcherson were truly the best part of this flick."
7785,"He's quite good here in an ultra adult film, as is everyone else, all playing against type: Kidman as a slut, McConaughey as a sexually troubled man, John Cusack as a backwoods maniac, and Macy Gray as a lovable servant. Issues with love, self - acceptance and racism are well dealt with and carried by outstanding acting, however the movie falls apart because the nonsensical storyline doesn't pull anything together and fails miserably to garner any understanding or interest. Zac Efron in his "" tidy whities "" or Nicole Kidman urinating on Mr. Efron. Ward's attention has been drawn to this case by Charlotte Bless (Nicole Kidman), a woman who has maintained a jail house correspondence with Mr. Van Wetter, and who believes she is in love with him. First Matthew McConaughey, if he's starting to get type - cast so what, he is absolutely wonderful in this role."
7656,"The plot is overly simple, the cops have a cursory role, and none of the characters other than that of Amanda's are well - developed. The movie and Amanda do a very good job of making you question everything. It succeeds in doing so on the shoulders of Amanda Seyfried. The investigators do give her the time of day, but still appear to brush her off. The central performance by Amanda Seyfried is a good one, she is very convincing as the determined heroine of the story, the cinematography is very fitting to the story, the cold and damp setting of Portland is wonderfully captured by the camera, the pace is fast as a bullet, each scene is quick and doesn't drag on and it has some genuinely scary and tense scenes, particularly towards the end."
7938,"It stars the on the up Joel Egerton who is very good in this and he receives excellent support from the rest of the cast who all put in believable performances. In the same fashion of the story, Edgerton and Price float through the film without devoting too much into their characters, but once the finale comes into play, they immediately switch gears and display their true acting abilities. The scenes in Cambodia take place on beaches and in the streets at night. The film is also strengthened by three powerful performances. Despite its modesty, the power of this thriller comes from the naturalistic performances and the gradual layers of the story that are revealed."
7658,"It's like watching a stream of Facebook threads, links and comments fly past for 90 minutes. The way its filmed from loads of different cameras and the humor in it is very funny. Thomas Kub (Thomas Mann) is a high - school student from Pasadena who is about to celebrate his 17th birthday. The dialogue lacks wit and most scenes rely on more crude and physical humour, such as dogs humping things, because that is always funny. Interesting to see what happens through out the movie, it is very intense so you will be blown away at a lot of scenes."
7787,"Mad (or at least seriously disturbed) King Christian VII (Mikkel Folsgaard - superbe) marries 16 year old English princess Caroline (Alicia Vikander) who happens to be George III's sister). The king is, as they say, easily led, and for a year or so Sturensee, despite being German, has a fine time as de facto ruler enacting liberal measures such as the abolition of serfdom and the repeal of censorship laws, not to mention free smallpox inoculations. Mads Mikkelsen gives a nuanced performance â€“' quiet intensity' in fact, and Alicia Vikander is equally intense. They are a serious couple imbued with the ideals of the 18th century Enlightenment but their passion is physical as well as intellectual. The king provides some zany (if not quite authentic) moments, appointing his Great Dane to his council and ordering Struensee to make Caroline a "" fun queen ""."
7940,"The insights are important, and often counterintuitive, and sometimes startling. For this, the format of the film--interviews with many family members and family friends--is absolutely crucial. While documentaries often take a very serious, somber, and issue - driven approach, Polley's film proves that real life can be just as magnetic without an epiphany of theatrics or cheap camera tricks."
7659,"As most reviewers have said this is one of Dr. Suess's best books and how can that possibly translate properly to a movie. The score by John Powell is epic and the animation and designs are gorgeous, which add great atmosphere in the darker parts of the movie. A good example is "" The Lorax "", the 1971 book which was about the depletion of the environment through industrial carelessness. Despite dire warnings from the forest guardian called The Lorax, the Once - ler continued his profligate ways until he turned the once beautiful landscape into a desolate wasteland. Through his wise old granny, Ted learns of The Once - ler, a hermit residing on the outskirts of the shallow metropolis: walled in and policed by a wicked, and very short, dictator O'Hare."
7695,"Put your "" Victorian "" influences aside for a night and have a good laugh. This movie was absolutely dirty, offensive, hilarious, racist, and crazy over-the-top moments. It's about the same style as Sacha Baron Cohen's previous movies, but it's done much better. It has the same LOL - quality as it did in Borat, but there are scenes where the comedy is so crude that it is almost uncomfortable watching / listening to it. The movie is definitely funny, but you will not enjoy it if you do not find jokes about racism and stereotypes funny."
7753,"Schadenfreude - pleasure derived from the misfortunes of others. David Siegel proudly claims he is individually responsible for George W. Bush winning the state of Florida and therefore the presidency; however, he chuckles that what he did was not exactly legal. The housing market just crashed, tens of thousands of families are entering foreclosure, including Jackie's best friend, and the Siegels are trying to move a $75 million dollar mistake. At the beginning of this disturbing documentary, David Siegel owns Westgate Resorts, one of the world's largest timeshare companies. David and Jackie married in 2000, would over the next nine years have eight children (including an adopted niece), and in 2006 oversaw the start of the construction of their 90, 000 square - foot Orlando dream home."
7788,"It isn't afraid to show both his good and bad sides and does a good job of illustrating his life from start to finish. The film really does an exceptional job at giving you a complete look at the man and it doesn't shy away or try to hide his darker side or moments that aren't as good and fun. Kevin Macdonald's (The Last King of Scotland) bio' doc' about Bob's life and legacy is a stylish and honest mediation on the man behind the myth that charts his physical and spiritual journey through the music world; his quest for success that would transform him from the rejected frontman of a budding ska band to the iconic, liberating arbitrator whose timeless tunes went beyond music and unified colours, creeds and a country in meltdown. Others are hilarious and most have a fantastic Jamaican Patois which is delightful to listen to. His struggle for success is told through friends and numerous members of The Wailers."
7682,"It has its intense moments but honestly you can't take your eyes off the screen it keeps you guessing whats going to happen next. Don't listen to the negative reviews, this movie is a must - see. With that said however, as serial killer movies go, "" The Raven "" is definitely a' cut' above the average. "" The Raven "" is a good watch for Poe fans with references to many of his stories and poems and they found great moments to include some of his illustrious and lasting lines. The Raven is based upon a great premise: in 19th - century Baltimore, a sadistic killer is on the loose, his murders based on the stories of the infamous poet and purveyor of the macabre, Edgar Allan Poe."
8431,"Yes, it's clearly established here that Lincoln Gordon, U. S. ambassador in Brazil, was the main figure behind the coup by feeding Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson about the politics behind president JoÃ£o Goulart's basic reforms that gave more power and rights to the common people and demanded more from the nation's rich and big foreign business folks who were unfair with their deals, usually avoiding to pay what's owed to the country. This sounds obvious, but the alternative (leftist) version sustains that the takeover by the military was planned in Washington and included an invasion of Brazil by U. S. Marines."
7789,"The performances are believable and the story is intriguing and always moving. The movie is so unconventional and different than most horror movies in a way that it makes you wonder if its a true story. Best part is that it makes you think and there are so many scenes wherein you just want to pause the movie because you just cant handle the intense suspense. Upon moving in, Ellison finds a box of 8 mm footage and a projector in the attic; contained in these reels of film are various murders dating from the 1960s up to present day â€” one of them is the filming of the hanging murder that occurred in his backyard. Conceptually and thematically speaking, it's not painfully original, but director Scott Derrickson makes up for that with striking visuals and a daunting soundtrack."
7663,"But it's funny, the actors are all good, and even though the premise is pretty silly--two secret agent types pursuing the same woman--the writers milked the possibilities about as much as they could without getting mindlessly stupid. This is coming from a chick who hasn't been able to talk to men in years. If you wanted to make a movie that was successful at the box office, you could plug the story lines of the top 25 movies for the last 10 years into a computer and have it generate a plot."
7790,"Adam Sandler really was great as Count Dracula, Adam Samberg was great as Johnny and Kevin James was a great Frankenstein. The visual animations in the movie are stunning with each scene being carefully visualised and is truly a treat for the eye. However, the mocking of Twilight is handled very well, the animations are superb, the characters and voice acting are done well and is well directed but a bit rushed at certain points during the film. But he works overtime to keep Mavis (Selena Gomez) from falling for a human boy named Johnny (Andy Samberg), who miraculously stumbles upon the hotel. The main characters are Selena Gomez as Mavis, Andy Samberg as Johnny and Adam Sandler as Dracula."
7681,"25 years later, the trio is still living there and attempting to help out, and taking care of the kids as well. There was something so special about these guys who went through anything just to make people smile and you could tell that they loved doing so. Like the originals, there are well placed jokes, nice set ups and the story mostly moves along at a nice clip. The mannerisms are flawless, sound effects are on point, even the' special effects' are done in a way that looks like the originals. All three actors who portray the stooges do a flawless job and make you actually forget that they are not the originals halfway through the movie."
7664,"This was SUCH a pleasant surprise. Stanton is a subtle and sophisticated storyteller with a Pixarian's understanding of how to build characters that stay with you. A lot of what you have seen in these types of movies up until now has drawn, in some way, on this series of novels. The gem is not without a few rough edges--but the core brilliance is unmistakable and undeniable. The story is quite a novel mix of Planet of the Apes, Conan, Red Sonja, Avatar, Star Wars and Superman (yep this is a superhero movie too)."
7791,"Christopher Kenneally's interesting Side by Side documentary presents filmmakers like George Lucas who claim celluloid is dead and those like Christophe Nolan who vow not yet to trade his "" oil paints for crayons . "" But the experts have valid and provocative points: the film advocates tout its warmth and color possibilities while the digital dudes trumpet the ease, low cost, and creative infinity. Christopher Kenneally's Direction is flawless, artistic and tight and his writing is succinct, understandable and unbiased. It isn't too technical for novices, but wasn't so basic as to feel dumbed down (the simplicity of the' how a camera works' visual aid graphics were very brief and explanations of abbreviations were only explained once) and you got to see various methods and techniques of film - making - a real behind the scenes. The film is really made up of Reeves acting as interviewer with a range of people involved in all the various aspects of the process â€“ directors, cinematographers, editors, camera manufacturers etc. and he does a decent job, but not a great job in this regard."
7668,"The torment in John McCain through Ed Harris's eyes is more eloquent that any line of dialogue. Ed Harris fills McCain's shoes with a respectful performance with dignity. All the actors are great, but Moore is absolutely stunning in the dramatic scenes. Roach presents some great moments in history as Palin watches Tina Fey doing an impression of her on SNL (surreal to watch an actor as Palin watching Fey doing Palin). Liberals will see this as a confirmation of their most deeply held convictions about Sarah Palin; her supporters will see it as a typical attack of the mainstream media on a particularly outspoken representative of American patriotism."
7669,"21 Jump Street features some of the most awkwardly humorous camera shot transitions, scene changes and music integration. It does a great job of not only avoiding giant clichÃ©'s, but making fun of them in the process. As far as comedies go, this is a pretty good way to start off 2012 Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the team behind the brilliant and absurd Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, use the fact that nobody is too invested in the source material to their advantage, subverting all expectations for what a movie like this would be. In a hilarious early scene Schmidt and Jenko's roles are reversed, with the jock forced to pose as the nerd and the nerd posing as the jock."
7671,"Good pace, strong acting (Pearce is a given but Gulgun the real revelation - genuinely emotional stuff) Anyone who slates this movie has lost their inner child (or mid-teen) watch it for what it is, not for what you think it reminds you of. There's lots of humour (especially in the first scenes - it's like Pearce is doing a Philip Marlowe impression) and the action is non-stop. Guy Pearce is hilarious and teamed up with Maggie Grace the laughs just keep rolling. While Lockout doesn't really bring anything completely new to the table, it is very entertaining and well worth multiple viewings. One of failures of recent action movies trying to be an 80's action flick is that they forgot that the hero needs to go up against a memorable villain."
7793,"Yes, it's based on a true story - the movie does it's best to allude that it sticks to technical accuracy. The film - makers have said that people forget that "" this is a movie "", and deliberate latitude and creativity is necessary for entertainment purposes to make it watchable and engaging. It was Ken Taylor and the Canadians who really pulled' the Canadian Caper' off so successfully. The UK and French governments were quite rightly upset by the movie saying that their embassies had refused to help out the Americans in trouble. Since the movie premiered, Ben Affleck has added emphasis on the movie postscripts since then that gives kudos to the Canadians' role."
7672,"After the masterpiece that was "" Anchorman "" he did seem to make a few movies where he played that guy over and over. Loved the way it was shot, especially the cut scenes where the director really had some fun. By the way, be sure to watch the making of featurette on the DVD--it makes the movie a lot more interesting to watch. Casa de mi Padre is meant to poke fun at Mexican telenovelas, and it pretty much succeeded. For those of you who enjoy comedy on many different levels, this one is a must."
7675,"The roles of Hades, Zeus and Hephaestus were really good, but three good performances just could not save this turkey from its bad writing and a dreadfully boring plot riddled with clichÃ©s. The Gods indeed deserved better than the 2010 remake of' Clash of the Titans', a wholly ill - conceived attempt at revisiting the campy Ray Harryhausen sword - and - sorcery epic that instead replaced the original's stop - motion visual effects with second - rate CG effects. Taking over the reins from French director Louis Leterrier is Johnathan Liebesman, and going by his previous works -' The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning "" and "" Battle: Los Angeles "" - the man is at best an efficient but uninspired director who pays more attention to visceral pleasures than to anything resembling depth. Both are mechanical at best and engineered with a specific purpose of taking his viewer from one jaw - dropping sequence to another, never mind the inconsistencies or the leaps of logic along the way. Before facing the worst of them all, Perseus will have to go up against a host of hideous - looking monsters - a fiery - mouthed Chimera with two heads at the front and a snake's head at its tail; a trio of towering Cyclops giants; a Minotaur; and a band of half - man, half - rock soldiers with four arms and two bodies that twist around on a pair of legs."
7676,"The German language adds a nice touch, and the way it is used helps a lot with creating a believable atmosphere to some scenes. The actors are doing a good job of portraying the stereotypes that they need in order for the humor to work. The style can best be described as toned down and with natural colors that work very well for this film. The story of the film was great, especially if you like conspiracy theories and such. The best parts include some great inside jokes specific to Americans and Germans, wonderful stereotyping of international ethnicities / prejudices, great attention to detail in costumes, sets, current culture trends and some above average acting by Julia Dietze, Goetze Otto and, of course, the wonderful Udo Kier."
7679,"It works on so many levels and is so much fun; the way the conventions of the' Horror' genre are turned upside down, while at the same time the story transcends the mere spoof and satire and becomes something new, entirely original â€“ just: Wow! The dialogues between the' office clerks' alone are beyond priceless and offer such great, apparently effortless performances by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford (two absolutely fantastic character actors, by the way) â€“ this movie has simply everything. This film is a horror movie that is poking fun at horror movies and movies in general. It is a funny - scary movie with great visuals and even better dialogues and one - liners, and its pace and twists (even the predictable ones) will not let you get bored even for a minute. The explanation to everything that's been going on, and also possibly the greatest 20 minutes ever shown in horror movie history."
7677,"The best part of it is, the story is about all 5 of the original guys, and their relationship with women and sex at their current juncture (31 years old). Jim's Dad and Stifler's Mom are hilarious on screen together. Jim's Dad is the funniest he has ever been - but again - not in an over the top way. All in all, it's a well - written, well - rounded film with some good plot twists. If the trailers are really funny, chances are the comedy is going to be a dud because all the funny moments are shown in the trailers."
8182,"The viewer really needs to pay attention to the details in order to understand everything that is going on, which creates a thought - provoking experience. The pacing script does do a good job of slowly revealing the anti-hero's personality - which is oddly charismatic. Another Miike, and this played at a festival, celebrating Miikes 100th movie! As psycho - killer movies go "" Lesson of the Evil "" is up there with the best of them. Miike's genius is to treat everything so matter - of - factly the film is almost banal to begin with before letting rip."
7947,"Both movies are about passion, beauty and sadness. In spite of the sometimes very dramatic developments and some emotional scenes the film contains many lighthearted and even funny moments. Somehow their heroic odyssey into the deepest regions of pain is neither pessimistic nor depressing, and their story communicates profound insights about the need for love, forgiveness and understanding in extreme circumstances. Broken Circle is not as' heavy' as Incendies and even has several smile - worthy moments to balance out the intensity. This is definitely one of the best movies of the year and it is a shame that it is only up for Best foreign film."
7948,"Baumbach takes those incredibly realistic and often uncomfortable moments, shapes them into black - and - white vignettes that are both immediate and personal, and then precisely combines those vignettes into this delicate and funny film. They co-wrote the film and Gerwig is sublimely engaging as Frances, a woman who prefers to focus on the moments along life's path rather than any sort of destination to the path itself. Gerwig does have a certain ebullient charm and Mickey Sumner shows promise as Frances' friend. As an actress, Greta Gerwig is funny and poignant, straddling the line between ordinary - looking and classically beautiful. Like most Hollywood movies there is no real story here, just a string of gratuitous scenes by a director who at best has a lackluster track record."
7794,"If you see this movie you need to see it for the acting and a fun way to spend 110 minutes. The film is by no means exclusive or inaccessible, it just reaches another level of storytelling and maniacal brilliance if you can make those connections. Beyond that layer, the film offers a potent combination of semi-gratuitous violence, loony antics and some stirring poignancy. The film begins with Marty, an alcoholic writer, looking for inspiration for his seven psychopaths. Zachariah has a fascinating story of little consequence to the film, about how he and his wife decades ago went on a serial killer killing spree, gorily offing renowned American killers including Zodiac."
7795,"Aging may bring wisdom, (well, at least to some) but it also brings a whole new array of problems; problems that cannot be understood by those outside of a highly specific age range. In short, this is an enjoyable movie, but those looking for goofball comedies or bloody fight scenes should go onto something else. Radnor stars as 35 - year - old Jesse, a college recruiter with an unmarketable English / history degree who is nostalgic for his own days at a picturesque Ohio university. When an old professor (Richard Jenkins) invites him back to campus for his retirement dinner, Jesse finds himself drawn to smart, peppy student Zibby (Elizabeth Olsen), despite his discomfort at the age difference between them. However, the witty, laugh - out - loud dialogue usually keeps the film and characters from feeling like they take themselves too seriously, making determinedly highbrow scenes like this clash uncomfortably with the generally self - aware tone."
7796,"Jarecki makes some of the most important and enlightening documentaries of today. It probably won't make much of an impact beyond preaching to the choir but then again none of his other fine offerings have fared much better and those are still greatly appreciated by thoughtful and humane audiences. It's a fair and balanced look at how it subsidizes thousands of jobs and locks up millions of innocent people. Against this background, Eugene Jarecki has written, produced and directed this striking documentary examining the impact of the war on drugs in America. These are only a couple of startling revelations from Eugene Jarecki's riveting documentary about America's terribly misguided War On Drugs."
7797,"Fast - forward a decade â€“ along with the noted Paradise Lost documentaries, things well This is a well - made documentary, but should perhaps only be seen after having delved into "" Paradise Lost 3 "". That is an incredible number of documentaries on the same case, and is probably a cinematic and judicial record of some kind. Those films brought mass attention to the case, due to the fact that the three accused - Damien Wayne Echols, Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley - were so blatantly innocent of this terrible crime. While the story of the West Memphis Three, their awful flawed trial and subsequent efforts to obtain freedom were well covered in the "" Paradise Lost "" trilogy of films, this single film overview has a lot of value."
7744,"Enticed by the fantasy inducing company called Rekall where one can live out one's fantasy for a fee, Douglas soon discovers he got more than he bargained for. A re-make of an old classic with an even bigger budget, better actors, and today's special effects would be worth 8 bucks. There's no Mars this time round, as the story gets set strictly on Earth, involving a carnival styled train service that commutes between the two territories, having to pass adjacent to the Earth's core, for some nifty CG effects involving gravitational force reversal. Where the original only had one computer - animated sequence involving primitive animated X-rays, this version has all the bells and whistles. However, the difference is in the touches of humor that always cropped up in the Schwarzenegger films."
7716,This film is about several couples who are expecting babies. It is an interesting comedy for expecting mothers. Rosie has a very positive attitude and has confidence that because she is young she will definitely have many more chances at pregnancy. virtually every guy in this group is totally henpecked and submissive to their wives.
7800,"So beautiful how the community came together to try and save each others lives and so sad that so many died and so many were left with grief. His appearances and interviews in the movie are the most eloquent, as one would expect from a playwright. It is structured by piecing together a lot of archive film that is edited so brilliantly that it like watching a scripted film that tells a great story, a film with real stars and characters. Decidedly so, the interviews shine a new light on the past events presented in the archival footage, and their coming together combines for a valuable film experience. Through a mightily informative combination of recent interviews and archival footage the film exhibits a noteworthy fight against both ignorance and indifference towards such a deadly epidemic as the one caused by the HIV virus."
7801,"Still, the film is very touching and can't help but make you think about your own life and trials, what advantages you may or may not have had compared to these people, and how you would have fared given their circumstances. Some of the kids with bright, shiny eyes who seemed to have so much energy and hope now seem to be dejected and defeated adults. Somewhere along the line, he came upon the idea of filming them every 7 years and that has turned out to be a great theme. It is refreshing, though, to see so many of them aging gracefully, being happy in their advancing ages, avoiding dwelling on what might have been if they had made different choices. Another happy twist was Peter's return after 28 years, he left the show after a massive press backlash following harsh comments on Thatcher's policy."
7802,"The only reason anyone might find Alex Cross appealing is because they get a kick out of watching bad movies or they really might enjoy seeing Tyler Perry try and do something different. His whole objective is to get into the mind of this madman while trying to maintain a steady family life, but instead of building tension between these two factors and having them play off one another and ultimately effecting Cross' personal life, the writer / director think it's more effective to jump from one setting to another with no lead - ins or relevance to what just happened or what is about to happen. Skeptics may think Tyler Perry was a bad choice to fill in a young Morgan Freeman's shoes but he was absolutely fine in the role. The trailer was a slice of many of the best scenes but, unfortunately the real film falls so sadly short of good storyline due to poor dialog and some jerky acting that the viewer struggles to make sense of the various actors. Tyler Perry's acting shines in a few scenes."
7803,"The costumes and make up went from absolutely stunning (it may take you a few minutes to recognize actors sometimes) to somewhat distracting. Overall this is a movie that transcends the simple elements of stars and plots and special effects, and boldly assumes to take the cinema to another level of storytelling, much like Avatar took film to a new level of technology a few years ago. Principle actors Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, and Xun Zhou each take on multiple roles that plays loose and fast with the actors' ages, races, and genders (Susan Sarandon, Keith David, James D'Arcy, and Doona Bae also have smaller roles). The truth is that Cloud Atlas is profound in its reach, its visual and acoustic impact, its mesmerizing flow and its completely ground - breaking storytelling, and movie goers will see it and feel it in their guts. All the different genres it brings together might have failed to coherently mesh."
7729,"This is a brutally realistic film about how both sides in the so - called' War on Terror' bend every rule of civilized conduct in order to further their own questionable ends. It's a story about people who have absolutely no doubt that their ends justify the means. Insightful is a word which best describes this film. The reasons as to why British born terrorists turn to the path of mass murder are explored well in this very British film. Sean Bean is well cast and his performance is brutal and minimal, he ticks the boxes of Cleanskin's demands."
7961,"Each of the cast carry their weight perfectly, especially Ryan Kwanten, Sarah Snook and Ryan Corr. Ryan Kwanten is appealing as the slacker; Sarah Snook, playing his best friend, looks very much like Australia's then - Prime Minister, Julia Gillard. The on - screen charisma between Kwanten and Navakovic works wonderfully, while director Peter Templeton does a wonderful job adding lots of turns and twists into this really well written little rom - com. Good performances from Ryan Kwanten (of True Blood fame) and Sarah Snook in the lead roles. Kwanten is in fine touch as the dopey and spaced - out Jonah and Ryan Corr (Coby from Packed to the Rafters) provides wonderful moments of pure comic timing."
7714,"Philosophers through the ages have distinguished the two based on choice. Merida's duty is to help keep the clans unified though a judicious marriage. The demonstrations of her skills are absolutely breathtaking. After seeing the trailer and the movie poster, one would think Brave would be about this young girl fighting and winning battles with her bow and arrow and a rousing adventure. Everything from Brenda Chapman is textbook Pixar class and charisma, but once Mark Andrews gets the reins (and you WILL know when it happens), the film takes an abrupt and uncomfortable shift towards the dark, and really challenges the boundaries of PG."
7806,"Since most of the film is interior shots, where space is limited, Rahimi was keen to have a camera in constant motion: with few exceptions, the camera is always kept moving, in order to offset the threat of staginess in The Woman's monologues. The metaphorical references used to convey the broader meaning of the plot are simply magical in their appeal. The innocence, the earthly beauty and the strength that Farahani's character in the film demanded are so exquisitely conveyed by her. This unusual war film, based on the novel of the same name that won the Prix Goncourt 2008, was brilliantly adapted to the screen by author Atiq Rahimi (Earth and Ashes, 2004) himself, in collaboration with his friend, the legendary scenarist, Jean - Claude CarriÃ¨re. In the continuous face - to - face with the spectator, Farahani demonstrates the majesty and flame worthy of an ancient Greek tragedienne."
7807,"This film moves at a good pace, is funny throughout, with some real laugh out loud moments, and leaves you with a good feeling at the end. Kevin's real life brother offered up some of the funnier moments dealing with domestic realities. This film is a sure crowd pleaser as it has the Asians, Hispanics and the white crowd both old and young covered quite well. A lot of the real players / announcers / refs from UFC are in this film adding to the feel of a real UFC match. It's a smart film in it's comedic moments."
7808,"This woman transforms all the young daughters in so many ways, teaching them valuable lessons along the way, she even gives the father a serving of her mind which is awesome. The characters are rich and complex, except for the father (played well by LaPaglia) who is a bit too one dimensional. Some reviewers have labeled the plot as complicated and bumpy - and it is - sort of like real life. It take lemons and makes lemonade mace you can spray in the face of your everyday depression. If you're Australian and don't enjoy Mental, you mustn't be human, there's a bevy of classic lines "" you're a mad bitch "", lots of laughs, and excellent performances all around."
7966,"Five outstanding performances and strong work by co-directors Scott McGhee and David Siegel prevent this one from spinning off into the neverlands of melodramatic muck. WHAT MAISIE KNEW isn't going to appeal to a mass audience but it's certainly a terrific little gem from directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel. Directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel have created a movie that feels like life, the vulnerability, the abruptness, the comedy, the joy. What Maisie Knew (2012), directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel, is an extraordinary movie about an extraordinary young girl. Both Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd and Joanna Vanderham are also great as these much more sympathetic adults."
7967,"The 2012 film "" American Mary "" features Katherine Isabelle, the breakout star of 2001's "" Ginger Snaps "", as a Med student who finds herself performing body mod surgeries that she finds out is quite good at. Isabelle plays Mary perfectly, she is desperate enough too take these strange jobs, but is still grounded and very professional. Ruby, Beatrice and the others are all portrayed as good people on the inside, but different on the out. Making him her test subject for new procedures, keeping him alive and aware the whole time. As for Faults, well, American Mary is a great film, but it peaks two - thirds of the way in, and by comparison it's ending feels a little timid and noncommittal."
7809,What a lot of the negative reviewers seem to have completely missed about this movie is that it isn't actually a crime movie - instead it's a metaphor for modern America. That's why the film contains so many political speeches in its background soundtrack - they're meant to be there to draw the link between what is unfolding on the screen and what is happening in the real America today.
7810,"o boy, Nicholas Barclay, for his home in Texas in 1993, to be found in Spain with an apparent amnesia six years later. The movie mixes interviews with the protagonist FrÃ©dÃ©ric Bourdin, Nicholas' family, American FBI and Consular officials, and has very atmospheric re-enactments done with Spanish actors and settings narrating the events occurred in Spain. The story is fascinating and amazing per se, but the way it is presented, is marvelous from a cinematic point of view as lets the viewer munch on a few philosophical themes: self - identity, reality and perception of reality, the connection between emotion and perception, and the use of cinematic narratives in documentaries based on real events, among other things. This is a documentary that attracts people to the genre because reinvents it. The film explores the unravelling of this story through interviews and very well realised reconstructions of the events."
7811,""" The Sessions "" is a sensitive and poignant film with an outstanding performance by John Hawkes as poet Mark O'Brien a childhood victim of polio that left him paralyzed from the neck down and dependent on personal attendants and an iron lung that enables him to survive the nights without suffocating. In voice and facial expression he manages to perfectly capture the life of a severely disabled man who likes to push against boundaries and retains a sense of humor--he tells someone that he believes in God because he needs to blame someone. Helen Hunt is memorable as the sex surrogate to whom O'Brien turns to help him achieve his dream of sexual intimacy with a woman. In 1997, director Jessica Yu won an Academy Award for her documentary short entitled "" Breathing Lessons: The Life and Work of Mark O'Brien "". Director Ben Lewin (a Polio survivor) has taken a specific part of O'Brien's story and turned it into a very entertaining and intimate film that explores the challenges faced by the disabled in leading a full and sexual life."
7812,"It featured glowing reviews by Irish critics announcing it to be the most important Irish film of the decade. What Richard did is a well made film with some good cinematography and performances from the principle cast. On a positive note there are some standout performances at times affecting and unsettling. Overall though, a beautifully tranquil soundtrack and a cinematography of rustic, windswept Dublin outskirts add to the haunted performance by Jack Reynor to make a slow building but thoughtful film. It's a very realistic movie with a solid script, and Jack Reynor does well in a complex leading performance."
7813,"With a mix of "" Alien, "" "" Toy Story "" and a bit of originality, Walt Disney Studios has created a wonderfully fun and nostalgic effort sure to put a smile on the faces of young and old, alike. Its visual design is brilliant and its action pieces pretty amazing. Still, this is another truly great animated film that does stand out from others this year in its own way, and one that's admirable and satisfying in all the best ways. Gamers, teens, twenty - somethings and many others will also enjoy most of this film, although it tends to sag a bit in the middle and could have used a bit more judicious editing (maybe 10 minutes could have been shorn). And the voice performances were great."
7814,"Everything he does is to make himself look desirable to her. allows each character in this dramedy to become whole and interesting without becoming marginalized. His supporters include his mother (Jacki Weaver, who was so great in Animal Kingdom), his OCD father (DeNiro) who so wants to re-connect with his son, his friend (John Ortiz) whose own marriage (to icy Julia Stiles) is a messy mess, his buddy from the asylum (a funny and not over the top Chris Tucker), and of course, Tiffany. The brilliance of this movie is the balance struck between the near violent emotional outbursts and the sharp, exacting words spouted by each of the characters. In reality though, all of the sap in Silver Linings Playbook can be overlooked due to the fact that the film is completely original, extremely funny, and contains outstanding acting from the two lead roles."
7973,"This wonderful documentary, directed by Robert B. Weide, traces the life and career of the movie master Woody Allen. The early footage of Allen's stand - up comic days is extremely funny, as are the archival clips of Allen as he began to appear on national shows such as Steve Allen, Johhny Carson, and Dick Cavett. The film is also chocked with interviews of fellow writers and collaborators, actors and actresses he has worked with, and certain film critics. The wealth of well - chosen clips really is very good, while the selection of talking heads add good value. It's basically a pure celebration of Allen's work and it does well to show the sheer volume of quality he has produced over the years."
7974,"He is intelligent, not in what the dislocations mean but in the fact they are shown to be at work, which now and then fool as depth in just the same way they fool the characters. Basically, "" Passion "" has a hint of what usually made DePalma's movies good. Many others will make a more streamlined, more exciting thriller, but no one is so committed to expose cinematic illusion like DePalma. But oh what sweet, sweet DePalmaesque inanity this is! It works as a - not very thrilling - thriller, and Noomi Rapace does a good performance."
7815,"This may seem like a hero story since Washington was successful in saving the lives of the majority of the passengers. Denzel Washington does an awesome, believable job as an alcoholic airplane captain, struggling with his addiction and accusations after the plane crash. It is easy to appreciate the high praise for one of Denzel's finest performances, the wonderful cast, and the quality of the narrative and storyline over the course of most of the film. It is worth seeing for the brilliant portrayal of Captain Whitaker and the performances of the other actors in the film. His power as an actor is what truly gives this movies its fire."
7816,"A lot has been said about its theatrics and casting, visual effects and costumes. On the other hand, Jude Law was perfect as Karenin, as were Domnhall Gleeson as Levin and Olivia Williams as Countess Vronskaya."
7817,"But worry not, Ang Lee's movie does not force you think on these lines, instead it's a film that lets you enjoy it on so many levels. Very few movies allow an actor represent so many emotions. If you are just looking for a beautiful 3D movie to feast your eyes, Life of pi can be it. Not to reveal the story further, it is with greatest pleasure to inform that cinematic excellence has been achieved in several categories: in an engaging tale â€” whether allegory or depiction of realistic, believable events, filled with protagonist's rarely matched curiosity, imagination and his often reasonably unanswered doubts, encouraging the same in viewers â€” of an uncommon character, indeed, brought to on - screen life by outstanding performances from two contributing leads, remarkably presented via ubiquitous, yet inconspicuous animation, exceptional, CGI aided visuals and superb usage of 3D photography, all along complemented with an uplifting score. It's an incredible film, a true cinematic achievement, possibly a classic and maybe will be the first 3D movie to break through and win the Best Picture Oscar."
8441,"It's not convenient to know too much about The Harvest before watching it, in order to preserve its ingenious surprises. The first half of the film is an emotive and honest "" coming of age "" tale about two very isolated teenagers (one of them, physically, and the other one, emotionally) who start to recover thanks to the innocent connection they develop with each other. Maryann is unresponsive and ungrateful to her grandparents (Leslie Lyles and Peter Fonda), so it is easy for them to believe it when Katherine suggests, with a smile, the girl may have behavioural problems. This is an engrossing, quite disturbing production, with terrific acting, especially from the juveniles. "" The Harvest "" is a great low - budget thriller with top - notch performances, highlighting Samantha Morton."
7849,"But, let's face it, the majority of leads in films are attractive, so, that's not much to base a similarity on. It does have some action and some tense moments later on but the initial set up is the zombie, R's, emotional growth and how meeting this girl sparks something in him to evolve. The directing, writing, and pretty much everything in the film was well done. Also, bonies, for some reason, move fast despite being in a more advanced stage of zombification. Their leader Grigio (John Malkovich) sends a group of teenagers, including his daughter Julie (Teresa Palmer), her boyfriend Perry (Dave Franco) and her friend Nora (Analeigh Tipton), to the outside to collect food and supplies for the population."
7873,"Thus O'Mara begins his quest to find the right officers for his special team with the help of his wife Connie (Mireille Enos) who is worried about his wellbeing and wants him to be protected as best as possible. O'Mara chooses Officer Coleman Harris (Anthony Mackie), Max Kennard (Robert Patrick) and his partner Navidad Ramirez (Michael PeÃ±a), Conway Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi) who's the brains in the operation, and finally Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling) who decides to accept O'Mara's proposal after a member of the mob kills a kid he knew from the streets. Together these officers begin to try to intercept and disrupt Cohen's operations working as an underground hit squad. It has some fun action sequences with some strong performances, especially from the always reliable Ryan Gosling who continues to reinvent himself in every movie. Bill Parker (Nick Nolte) pitches the idea to honest cop John O'Mara (Josh Brolin), who is also a happily married war veteran."
7877,"Animation is of the highest quality, rivaling that of big budget anime movies. While face - offs with Harvey Dent & the Mutant Leader in Part 1 was great, battles with the Joker & Superman in Part 2 takes animation movies to a whole new level. All of these events come together beautifully (and with many surprises) in a well - paced, brilliantly written, thought provoking, elegantly animated, and savagely action - packed epic played out by fascinating characters. It can be said that Dark Knight Returns, when both parts are viewed as one whole movie, is a true animated epic worthy of some awards. Specially comic Superheroes, Specially seniors of them, and this "" Specialty "" is even more with The Dark Knight."
7880,"He clearly has a love of the material and his choice of Amy Seimetz really makes the film work. The tired phrase "" it's not for everyone "" certainly applies here, but if you are a Terrence Malick fan or just enjoy being challenged by somewhat abstract themes, this one is worth a look. Perhaps the best explanation of what the film is about is by one Mach Kobayashi, a young man, who has posted a Youtube video entitled "" Upstream Color Explained (With Stick Puppets!) While Primer was a film that appeals on an intellectual level, Upstream Color appeals best to the artistic side of the brain. If however you have experienced or would like to experience films where you have to dedicate your ability to assess and determine the underlying idea that is linking a series of enigmatic actions and subtle scenes, UPSTREAM COLOR will intrigue and probably charm you."
7885,"In the first short, how funny is it to see Kate Winslet and Hugh Jackman go on a date, with everyone being oblivious to the large scrotum attached to his neck except for Winslet?"
7887,"clocking in at just under 90 minutes, the movie has two surprise acts and characters best kept under wraps, one to reverse the mantra that the witch hunters adopt to their methods, and the other a fine character introduced that shed clues to their origin story. Its made to a hilariously entertaining popcorn flick with over-the-top action and unrealistic weapons that wouldn't have existed given the' time period' this movie seems to be set in. It was fun to spot traditional witch lore in the scenes, even as they took liberties to invent their own lore. Gemma Arterton is perhaps best known for her role as the Bond girl in Quantum of Solace, with her dramatic roles having never made it here. While Renner pretty much looks dour throughout the movie, Arterton seems determined to have fun with her ass - kicking female heroine of a role, and her portrayal of Gretel resembles a Lara Croft for the medieval ages."
7893,"Law's morally ambiguous Dr. Jon Banks and Mara's psychologically ambiguous Emily are the only two main characters. He's modern, selfish, compassionate, professionally - oriented, family - oriented, has respect for the legal system, and will go to extremes to distinguish between right and wrong. Dr. Victoria Siebert (Catherine Zeta - Jones) is a former attending psychologist of Emily who is consulted by Dr. Banks to try and uncover some of the dilemmas of her past. The taut, gripping, Hitchcockian screenplay by Scott Z. Burns gleefully twists and turns its way into unexpected plot developments, allowing Soderbergh to roam the apartments and streets with his camera, creating an intense yet unusually hypnotic atmosphere that is irresistibly gorgeous to watch. Rooney Mara is once again stunning as Emily Taylor, a woman who starts taking prescription antidepressants to cope with her husband's release from prison."
7894,
7896,"Beautiful Creatures has a big Romeo and Juliet thing going on, but at the same time, there's mysteries, prophesies, hypocrisy, Southern politics, Civil War history, religion, death, evil forces, and all sorts of madness making for quite an interesting story (with some very witty and sarcastic dialogue to put a cherry on top). Beautiful Creatures starts off rather beautifully, with awesome visuals that would set to engage and create that visual feast for the eyes, crafting a mystery from the onset in the dreams of protagonist Ethan Wate (Alden Ehrenreich), who see an ominous sequence of events, only to not see who that raven haired female is due to a deliberate obscuring by her long tresses. And the fight between good and evil is a fight in many of the fantasy - movies, and that was a red line in this movie and worked good. Despite the fact that the LA Times and the NY Times gave the flick great reviews, a bunch of lesser - known critics were much harsher on it. There is conflict between the light and dark casters, as well as these elements within the characters, fighting for supremacy - danger and fear run through the film, and you will be surprised more than once."
7897,"Six years after successfully restarting the most important character of his entire movie - making career, Willis has to watch it all crash and burn to the ground with this loud, dumb and plain boring fifth chapter, the erroneously - titled' A Good Day to Live Hard'. None of it matters, because - surprise surprise - Bruce Jr forgives Bruce for years of neglect and calls him Dad for the first time, and they fly home as heroes in a sunset glow. But like all Die Hard movies, there has to be at least one sensational action sequence, and that is at the film's beginning."
7901,"SLACKERS was only 22 years ago, and Linklater has matured into one of the most original filmic storytellers in the history of the medium. Content-wise, the conversations in this latest' Before' film are of much lower quality. Obviously there's no big fantasy battle or a near death experience in an incinerator for the meaning of life to be physically explained but in the power of words, and words alone, Before Midnight manages to become the poster child for screen writing and brilliant storytelling for years to come. As Jesse this time around, Hawke uses every ounce of magnetism, charisma, and acting ability to bring himself to the levels of legendary actors like Daniel Day - Lewis and Marlon Brando. The film is breathtakingly accurate and precise in capturing the love and relationship of couples, it will and should be studied by film schools and writers for years to come."
7903,"It's pretty much a guarantee that if you grew up with fairy tales, you would certainly know the story of Jack and The Beanstalk. Just like in the original fairy tale, Jack is a poor farm hand who is tricked into trading valuable livestock (in this movie it's a horse rather than a cow) for supposed "" magic beans . "" Unlike many of Hollywood's reimaginings of fairy tales, this film is actually decent. It's a fun little adventure that kids and open - minded adults will get a kick out of. Hoult and McGregor battle the giants in the clouds and then engage in round two when the giants come to earth."
7905,"If you like to just lay back and see great fights and a little eye candy then this is the movie for you. The fight between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow remains to be the only action that excites and one part of the climax has a nutty scene with The Rock riding huge vehicles and shooting like a badass. It's amazing how many good movies produced this year have been relegated to sub-par status, while others that shouldn't be given a glance are given zenith status as great pieces of work, art, and other such pop - cultural sub - standard excrescences achieve more than their worth in fool's gold. Elodie Yung, Ray Park and Adrianne Palicki are just okay. Stormshadow who appeared to be dead at the end of the first movie somehow is alive."
7906,"Stoker, celebrated Korean director Chan - wook Park's English - language debut, is a dark, disturbing and diabolical film about an introspective young girl named India who witnesses the loss of innocence following the sudden and untimely death of her beloved father. Those who have seen Hitchcock's 1943 thriller Shadow of a Doubt wouldn't find it hard to draw parallels. Park limns a colorful canvas like only he can and his characters tread it like spirits caught in a limbo. While the characters are highly emotional, their strangely selfish actions make it difficult for the viewers to sympathize with them. The acting of movie's three lead characters viz. Mia Wasikowska, Nicole Kidman, and Matthew Goode is quite brilliant and in that order."
7907,"This movie had heart, a good storyline, a well - written script, emotion and some intense moments. Mildly entertaining look at the origins of the characters from' The Wizard of Oz "" has everything down pack. From great visuals to imaginative set pieces, this film has everything. While most of the things in this film are mostly kids stuff, Weisz infuses her character with a wickedly sassy seductive charm that elevates this film past most of its problems. A very fun and crafty Rachel Weisz takes the role of Evanora and grips the audience with charm and viciousness in all the right doses."
7908,"And it has one of the funniest babies ever put on film. It is great for all ages. Well, these kinds of films are remarkably fun and has impressive technical achievements but there's nothing else to merit in the end. The conflict of this plot is the titular family's choices if they would choose to follow their overprotective father or a stranger who makes daring ideas to survive from the natural condition. Everything is ought to be silly and hilarious."
7909,"It was a nice change of pace from all the recent comedies that have to go to the extreme with language and sex humor to make their point. It's a genuinely funny the story of two life long friends and magicians who share a magical act and are threatened by the modern chris angelisc magician played by Jim Carrey. The plot: Getting beaten up at school, Burt Wonderstone finds joy in a magic kit that his mum gets him for his birthday. Treated like a human punch bag by Wonderstone, Steve Buscemi gives a great performance as Anton Marvelton, with Buscemi showing Marvelton to be a humble guy, who explodes when Wonderstone finally over steps the mark. However, both Burt's obnoxiousness and a new street magician, played by Jim Carrey, soon get in the way of his success, and he's forced to re-examine what his career means to him."
7911,"It feels like you're genuinely watching a 911 operator help someone through a kidnapping and this is largely due to the acting by both Berry and Abigail Breslin who plays the girl in the trunk. The first couple of acts are fairly slow on action, but there are plenty of nail - biting scenes and overall tension building that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. The really distinctive feature is that writer Richard D'Ovidio has made Jordan, the dispatcher, a compelling, easily identifiable figure by emphasizing not only her strength and craftiness but her insecurity and self - doubt as she does her best to assist people in making it through sometimes unimaginable crises. The movie is a bit overwrought at times (again, looking at you, last half hour) and it ultimately succumbs to too many serial - killer clichÃ©s, but "" The Call "" is a whole lot better than many of the more highly publicized, big - budget thrillers of recent times. This movie is not going to win any awards or anything like that, but it is fun to watch."

7916,"*** SPOILERS *** Excellent portrayal by actor Al Pacino of legendary pop music pioneer as well as song writer & producer Phil Spector who's high flying career in the music industry came to a sudden crash on February 3, 2003. Pacino's embodiment of Spector is wholly memorable, Mirren provides the picture with true elegance, and the supporting performances are forbidden to tread the line of unimportance. This HBO movie is worth seeing for the performances. Almost as entertaining as Specter and Baden is Baden and co-counsel Bruce Cutler, played flawlessly by Jeffrey Tambor. With a frustrated Linda Baden doing everything to convince the jury to find Spector innocent she also contracted pneumonia undercutting her attempts to successfully defend him."
7917,"It has romance that is suppose to save their world and change their lives, but once again just like any other young adult film, the romance is nothing more than a bunch of good looking people falling in love and doing romantic clichÃ© stuff. Plenty of sophisticated action as well as thought - provoking concepts of love, loyalty, perseverance. "" The Host "" was written and directed by Andrew Niccol who has a talent for creating smart, inventive stories about people trapped by their circumstances. And Saoirse was brilliant in playing two personalities. Saoirse Ronan plays two roles here and she fills enough heart on both characters."
7918,Tina Fey as Portia and Paul Rudd as John turn in pleasant performances as an admissions executive and a progressive school teacher respectively. Admission requires no small amount of sympathy for the messy business of growing up and getting ahead â€” Weitz navigates the vagaries of family ambition well.
7919,"You can sense it wants to be smarter and more thrilling that it is, but where Usual Suspects is slick and stylish on its journey, this really just bumbles and blasts it way to the finish hoping it can carry you with it by force alone. Well the reason is because he used to date Dawson the therapist and he became abusive, so she stopped dating him but he kept coming to sessions where she brainwashed him into forgetting her and bringing her a valuable painting. Besides that Trance is an intellectual delight with enough twists and turns to keep the majority of people interested. Under the persuasive encouragement of Cassel's band of criminals, he ends up seeking the counsel and help of hypnotist, Elizabeth (Dawson), to retrace his steps. It takes pleasure in scrutinising the tricks and tics of memory."
7921,"Specifically the drones make excellent noises at various stages of the film. It has a good amount of twists, and real depth. One of the best Sci - Fi movies ever made. each area was just right with the right amount of story line, emotion and suspense with a very clever write up. Super performance by Tom cruise, Olga Kurylenko, Andrea Riseborough and of course Morgan freeman."
7923,"The actor who portrays Robinson, Chadwick Boseman, bears an uncanny resemblance to the color barrier breaking athlete, and truth be told, actually does a better job than Robinson himself in the 1950 biopic, who displayed a surprising lack of charisma considering his accomplishments both on and off the field. 42, a biopic that unsurprisingly stuns the audience with it's non-clichÃ© drama, amazing acting from every word delivered to every facial expression, and Boseman's athletic and acting abilities. Chadwick Boseman & Nicole Beharie did a magnificent job portraying the grace and courage of the Robinsons. This film has some corny parts to it - like most films of this ilk, it sanitizes some things and does tie a nice bow on some issues glossed over in the retelling. While most love stories come across as corny especially in a sports movie, this works thanks to the chemistry and wonderful acting of Boseman and Beharie."
7927,"Michael Bay's "" Pain and Gain "" is a very bleak, very dark comedy about three knucklehead bodybuilders in pursuit of their own American dream, even if the road there is paved with sex, drugs, torture, humiliation, and even murder. But it was a dementedly fun ride, and Bay, after making two bloated sequels about giant robots, finally returns to his stride. These "" criminals "" have to be the dumbest people in the world. The mastermind to this is Danny Lugo (played by Mark Wahlberg who again is great) who concocts a scheme to kidnap one of the clients of the club (Tony Shalhoub), and extort his millions. All of the cast was well chosen, from Dwayne to Shalhoub and especially Wahlberg."
7928,"The overwhelming success of this movie in only its second week is proof that the standards of young movie goers is almost non existent. Better movies get drowned out because the industry is so over-saturated by crap like this, so in a sense, you can say that movies like this really are actually part of "" the end . "" It is a very clever and entertaining comedy, with hilarious and dirty dialogues. There have been many funny drug movies made, and made by funny people on drugs. Super Troopers was funny, Cheech and Chong was funny, Half Baked was funny, this was not funny."
7929,It is an awesome superhero Action flick a huge improvement over Iron Man 2 (2010) and million ways better than the new Marvel comic book film Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)! Gwyneth Paltrow did a wonderful performance as Pepper un like she did in Iron Man 2. Tony Stark (the always wonderfully charismatic Robert Downey Jr.) is falling apart. Tony Stark was brilliant fixing and building a new armored suits. Aldrich Killian participated in the development of Extremis thereby amassing a group of Extremis - enhanced soldiers under his command.
7930,"Ms. Moore is simply superb here. She's a national treasure and woman - of - a-certain-age Hollywood still calls. The Drama Club is run by a terrific Nathan Lane, a failed Broadway Star, who delivers the funniest lines in his trademark condescending dryness. Ms. Moore's arc is predictable, but the journey remains a lot of fun. One hopes Ms. Moore will keep you after class."
7934,"As the film went the main protagonists have a great on screen chemistry, the story is an in - depth look at shallow marketing and it does that brilliantly. The story moves along at a good pace, there were no boring parts. There are layers to the characters and story that requires a re-watch to get everything. Given how well this is put together (not to mention Amber Heard, who completely nails her character perfectly, and then some), it's a bit surprising this was not the big commercial success it could have been. When he brings it to the attention of Six (Heard) he is excited at the prospect of becoming rich but a double cross changes everything."
7937,"When Cumberbatch is captured, he and Pine briefly become caricatures of Hannibal Lecter and Agent Starling from Silence of the Lambs. Cuberbatch's performance is the best thing this time and overshadows everyone else. This kind of formula occasionally produces an awesome movie or two, but those movies are usually fresh and intelligently made in some way that makes them stand out. This movie is missing the hallmark epiphany moments Star Trek is famous for."
7939,"What you get here is a headache inducing, cerebral bombing, diarrhoea of pointless noise masquerading as "" cinema "" which is the aural equivalent of a strobe light for your earholes. This movie is more like an e mail you got 4 years ago that was hilarious, and someone sent it to you again. The result being, a sensation of getting an electric eggwhisk inserted into your brain and switched on. The Google campus proved an interesting site in itself."
7942,"Hence the popularity of ladyboy prostitutes in Thailand: they bring to life, in a non-threatening form, a powerful and archaic unconscious fantasy. The best parts were the Bangkok night scenery. This film, along with "" Anti-Christ "" is a perfect example of the type of scandals that go on at Cannes for quite stupid reasons. If you know Nicolas Winding Refn's style and like it then you'll enjoy this movie but if you've only seen Drive and believe this is going to be in the same style (because of the same actor, similar cinematography, same musical style.) His works were mostly known by cinephiles, artsy people and intellectuals interested in film analysis (in a general way of course)."
7943,"Lots of funny scenes and low brow references that have become a hallmark of the Hangover series, there is even a bit of a teaser for a continuing of the series in the end credits, so stay tuned. The carbon - copy second instalment was stale for the most part yet still managed a handful of laughs thanks to the general funniness of Zach Galifianakis' socially demented Alan; this episode however, is almost completely devoid of humour. Had the original Hangover stood on its own, not possessing sequels of lesser quality leaching off its name, it could've very well become a classic in the next several years. Since The Hangover these four guys have experienced great success; Bradley Cooper has been nominated for an Oscar, Ed Helms became a little more then Andy from The Office, and Zach Galifianakis (the funniest of the bunch) starred on HBO's Bored to Death and Ken Jeong is a recurring character on Community. There are some very funny moments but the cheap laughs far outnumber the good ones."
7944,"This film is about rescuing Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and stopping a brilliant mastermind terrorist hijacker Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) and his team of hijackers. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson and Michelle Rodriguez lead a cast of returning all - stars as the global blockbuster franchise built on speed delivers the biggest adrenaline rush yet in this explosive Action Film. Otherwise, Tyrese Gibson and Chris' Ludacris' Bridges are left with the snappy comedic relief, while Gina Carano, Gal Gadot, and Elas Pataky merely get to look feisty and hot in their action scenes (but at least they do a great job at it). Gibson's one - liners are snappy and more amusing than they were in' Fast Five', and his banter with Kang and Ludicrous not only keep the film's momentum going while the plot pieces are put in place but also establish the kind of teamwork necessary for the subsequent action scenes. In between, the film slows down a bit, but there's frequent fist - fights and pursuits, a few scenes of witty comedy, and there's one decent car - racing scene."
7945,""" Epic "" is a delightful animation with a story of a fight between the good, represented by tiny creatures that protect the forest and environment, against the evil Boggans that want to destroy the forest. The pretty standard stuff of elfish lore, where magical faerie folk protect the woods and the life enclosed inside. His special protÃ©gÃ© is independent - minded brash Nod (Josh Hutcherson), who disregards structure and rules. The film also has likable characters and relationships, and good voice performances by Amanda Seyfried, Josh Hutcherson, Colin Farrell, Beyonce Knowles, and the rest of the cast. The acting is really superb and all the actors have great chemistry together: Amanda Seyfried, Josh Hutcherson, Christoph Waltz, Colin Farrell, Aziz Ansari, and Jason Sudekis are terrific, while BeyoncÃ© is the best of all."
7946,"This film was highly expected among the cinephiles and film critics who had watched the Oscar - winning film "" A Separation "". both Bejo and Rahim deliver promising performances and the young Belgian actress Pauline Burlet shows that her lack of experience can't prevent her from shining among the other stars of the film. The morality isn't exactly black - and - white for the viewers to pick and choose which character is the charming, perfect hero of the story. Modern technology like email takes a lot of the blame in the film for conflict and misinterpretation, which could be reflective of reflective of Farhadi's own conservatism. Asghar Farhadi outdid himself with this masterpiece, following up on the Oscar - winning' A Separation'."
7949,"It is well crafted by Steven Soderbergh, a veteran director with such films as Traffic, Erin Brockovich and Ocean's Eleven under his belt. Two of Hollywood's big - name alpha males â€“ Michael Douglas and Matt Damon â€“ play the lead roles delivering strong and convincing performances. The supporting cast members are equally effective as the leads. The standout here is, unquestionably, Rob Lowe as Liberace's plastic surgeon Dr. Jack Startz. All submit strong performances despite brief appearances in almost cameo roles."
7950,"That Will Smith chose Shyamalan, a abysmal film maker for years, is distraughtly. Director M. Night Shyamalan, the man who continually keeps falling from grace, one film after the next, is still tumbling further from his talented beginnings, although here the director crashes and burns."
7951,"All the best parts of this film are well - packaged and sold in the gripping theatrical trailer. It's imperative that the car he's apparently driving flips and tumbles several times and ultimately bursts into flames. You'd expect suspense, twists, intelligent plot misdirection and all sorts of thrilling viewing? The best scenes in this movie easily are the ones with just the two of them on screen because their chemistry and on screen charisma is enough to carry any scene."
7952,"Arguably, a great biopic embraces the complexities of a person's life while using storytelling to organize such intricacies. This film centers on the real life Lovelace's claims of being used and abused by her first husband, Chuck Traynor, and being browbeaten into the pornography industry. While Seyfried donned a shaggy brunette hairstyle and freckles to deglamorize herself, she still looked a lot prettier than Lovelace on her best day. Still, Seyfried did well with what she was given. Her best scenes include the lie - detection test, a surprisingly touching moment with an unexpectedly cordial publicity photographer (Wes Bentley), and her begging her emotionally cold mother for asylum from her abusive husband."
7953,"There are no big action scenes or special effects here, just really good writing with actors who can bring such a realistic story to life. Duncan seems fascinated by Owen (played by Sam Rockwell) and how he uses humor in almost everything he says. The setting as well as the way people dress and talk to each other is right out of an 80's film - is it a coincidence that all of the music played in the movie is from that era? There's a very natural and wholesome vibe to it, especially in the water park scenes - nothing looks too modern or high - tech; it's just a place where people go to have an old - fashioned good time. While Steve Carell may be the most popular name on the poster, the movie has a great cast altogether."
7955,"Sure it has a lot of action, but anyone who is a true Superman fan knows that Kal El's battles were almost always explosively long. Casual moviegoers and superhero fans will find something to enjoy. Man of Steel has great wreck - everything action that makes full use of 3D effects and simply looks awesome. The story is decently paced, and fueled by strong performances by Michael Shannon and Russell Crow (e). The charm is replaced by the character development the man of steel experiences when he must choose between his past and his future."
7956,"Sure, the characters might not be 100% believable or even really that likable--but, if you sit back and watch it with modest expectations, you'll find the good easily outweighs the bad. This is an excellent and must see movie for all teenagers for a few reasons. Also the kid that plays Biaggio really steals the movie and is so much fun to watch. The concept of this story has merit, however the execution is well off the mark in all respects. The cosmetics which help keep everything believable were ignored in some respects."
7957,"The controversial lyrics from Lou Reed's "" Walk on the Wild Side "" kick off this exceptional documentary about the oft - ignored back - up singers who have played (and continue to play) a huge role in some of the biggest songs of all - time. The main women featured here all admit to being daughters of preachers, and fine - tuning their ability to harmonize during their youth while singing in the church choir. You may not recognize the names or faces, but you will surely recognize the voices. Ms. Love has been elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and may be best known thanks to her annual appearance on the David Letterman Show at Christmas. Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Stevie Wonder, Lou Adler, Sheryl Crow, Bette Midler and Mick Jagger are just a few of the well - known singers who talk about some back - up singers who everyone will know from certain hit songs yet it's highly unlikely that you'll know their names."
7958,especially if you want to see a good movie as well as various handbags and shoes. The film goes through this cycle like six times before the cops finally arrest them.
7959,"Monsters University is great fun and it's Pixar best since Up! Still the same incredibly interesting world with all its colors, fantastic creatures, and quirks. It doesn't end with Sully holding up the Scare cup but it takes one more great scene to bring Mike and Sully definitely together. This film has homages to all the classic college comedy movies, and as it doesn't hold out on laughs for the kids and adults, it has a great amount of heart. In an overwhelming blockbuster summer of over-hyped excitement followed by mild to severe disappointment, Monsters University isn't just a good sign for Pixar, it's a good sign that 2013 can be one of the best years of film."
7962,"Some parts kept you on the edge of your seat, of course, rooting for the good guys. The battle sequences are epic, the monsters and robots are amazing, Kids especially will love them, and the action goes on and on. Any change to see a real action movie with almost unstoppable battles monsters, and a dose of special effects so amazing you just leave you with your mouth open. The aliens and robots blend very well with all their surroundings. Since the hulls of the robots are so easily breached let's protect the pilots with at least some sort of oxygen mask!"
7963,"The movie is breathtaking and captures you from the first seconds. Mr. Rush acting is superb, as are the art direction, cinematography, score and of course, the plot. complete the work and make it an unmissable, different from all the other great movies of Tornatore. The Best Offer, with its tight screenplay, lush sets, brilliant performance by Geoffrey Rush and beautiful score by Ennio Morricone, also exemplifies the sophisticated expertise filmmaking. Set in Italy but filmed in English, "" The Best Offer "" is a highly unusual and unusually interesting tale of two lost and hurting souls reaching out to one another for meaning and salvation."
7964,"After going way over-budget and enduing a complete revision and reshoot of the final act, WWZ wasn't exactly set up for success. A South Korean airbase is portrayed as a series of dark rooms; too much of the movie takes place in an airline seat; there is a lot of sitting around inside of the aircraft carrier, etc. . WWZ keeps the origins of the virus an enigma and right away this damages the premise. It's also worth noting that it has several humorous scenes too. If anything, these scenarios bring out the best of all of them."
7965,"Matt Damon is decent as the film's protagonist Max who is an ex-con now working on assembling the droids which keep order on the now overpopulated Earth. Neill Blomkamp burst out of the scene in 2009 with "" District 9 "", a very similar project in several regards, and blew audiences away with a clever mix of documentary - style filmmaking, explosive action, and the refreshing implement of an obvious social commentary. The first moments Max is shown after being exposed to radiation, the film jumps into a nerve - racking tone, and it is very effective, as it is blended with several dramatic elements that range from innovative to pretty common. However, almost no facet of the movie IS well - developed: there are several 'em otional' moments in the movie that lack impact simply because the audience is given no time to get to know the characters involved before these important events occur. The set and production designers truly did a great job with the locations."
7968,"Really a cute film as it is once again the Minions stealing the movie. This film has you laughing quite often, contains humour that both kids and adults can appreciate, and had at least one moment that was worthy of clapping out loud to. The Anti-Villain league (AVL) agent Lucy Wilde recruits Gru to help her agency to discover who has stolen the laboratory and its research. Having more of the minions - one of the best assets of the first film - was a masterstroke also, and their subplot also gave the story an increasing sense of jeopardy and threat (though theirs is a little more interesting than that of world domination). The main character Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) is likable and funny."
7969,"There are quite a few unexpected twists and turns along the way, and the wonderful supporting cast (James Woods, Richard Jenkins and Jason Clarke, to name a few) keep even the most clichÃ©d characters fun and interesting. The world has seen millions of movies where USA comes under attack."
7970,"Here, King's raucous enthusiasm becomes almost worrisome, especially in contrast with his bemused buddies, all more content to act their ages. Wright's characteristic swish - pans and dynamic sound effects, paired with some of the most intricately crunchy fight choreography seen in ages make The World's End thrilling in the most visceral sense. The robot designs are eerily simple, the pace and physical slapstick are howlingly perfect, while the grim, sepia lighting is perfectly atmospheric for the intensifying sci - fi peril and slurring melodrama unfolding."
7971,"It's the funniest thing that you'll see all year Melissa Mcarthy was the funniest You'll love this movie! "" The Heat "" is the funniest movie of the year. There were continual laughs throughout due to the witty lines and expert delivery, with some real high points of absolute hilarity. Director Paul Feig ("" Bridesmaids "") is genius with niche R - rated comedy starring women, and is blessed with Bullock and McCarthy's A-Games. Writer Katie Dippold (of "" Parks and Recreation "") is brilliant given a very predictable movie scenario."
7972,"Gore Verbinski has delivered a film that moves leisurely along peppered with rousing action sequences, comedy, villainy and pathos. Johnny Depp is a master at facial expressions and this type of comedic timing. The scenery is awesome and the action scenes are beautifully photographed or green screened, CGI'd or real. The film stars Armie Hammer as the Lone Ranger and Johnny Depp as Tonto, these two have great chemistry that really shows, The Lone Ranger also stars Helena Bonham Carter, William Fichtner, and Tom Wilkinson. The Lone Ranger rides strong for several reasons that include direction, cinematography, casting, screenplay, special effects, pacing, acting, and story."
7983,"Paul Giamatti and Samuel L. Jackson are in so many different films these days, their voices are tiring. A nice change of pace for Dream Works after seeing three "" Madagascar "" films and four "" Shrek "" movies. As good as Pixar is making animated movies, the best counterpart is, without no doubt, Dreamworks. It's a whole load of fresh new characters and designs, excellent animation and lovely colours as usual with an animated film. Also some good quotes which you may remember for a while;' Snailed it' ' That snail is fast'."
7975,"Coming - of - age teen dramas with a comedic flair that speak to that tumultuous period of life are rarely worthy of discussion. The exceptions hover film greatness: Rebel Without a Cause, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Dazed and Confused, The Breakfast Club, and Say Anything. Along comes young director James Ponsoldt and his adaptation of Tim Tharp's novel. While not perfect and falling just short of the level of those classics, it is nonetheless a welcome addition and quite interesting. some good, some not so wise (just like real teenagers)."
7976,"Overall, the story is brought to new heights with the outstanding performances by a cast including the likes of Veronica Mar's star Kristen Bell and Freaks and Geeks alum Martin Starr. It strong points were performances by Kristen Bell and Mammie Gummer. The setting of the pool, Leigh's pale looks, the nature hikes, the quiet gas station at night, create a fitting melancholic atmosphere to surround the story. When the characters grow up at the end, Jason and Todd for the first time, Leigh and Mel for a second time, it's a mature choice, a step forwards. The interactions between the two age groups were beautiful, as each learns and grows from the other."
7977,"The same scene moves from daylight to dusk, rain to sunshine, storm surge to quiet beach, with every single new camera angle. The perfect weapon for any weapon need, from repelling flying sharks, to casual home usage. The sharks must band together and overcome adversity and strife while trying, desperately, to make their way back to the only home they've ever known. If you love sharks and tornadoes, well. Sharknado is, truly, the cinematic experience of a lifetime."
7978,"But by and large this is a moving, gripping, at times infuriating film that will stick with you after the credits roll. Haunted by the Newtown school shooting, the Aurora theater shooting, as well as countless local and minor shootings, American lives have been turned upside - down on numerous occasions. Five years later, first time director Ryan Coogler brings this story back to the public eye with Fruitvale Station, a heart - wrenching drama that is sure to leave you misty - eyed. The film then rewinds, and proceeds to cover the 24 hours leading to the incident at Fruitvale station, the last 24 hours of Oscar Grant's life. The film's real strength is the passionate portrayal of Oscar Grant by up - and - coming actor Michael B. Jordan."
7979,"' R. I. P. D.': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) One of the summer's biggest expensive casualties is this Dark Horse comic adaptation starring Ryan Reynolds and Jeff Bridges as two police officers in the after life fighting undead ghouls. The overall premise of an undead police department is pretty neat, they use a lot of cool weapons, and they have some really quirky rules and ideas. Some of the most amusing moments emerge from the interplay between the characters, and the clever gag in which everybody sees them as different people. For comic - book - inspired stories about enforcers tackling the supernatural without the general public knowing, the three Men In Black movies succeed in everything RIPD tried to do, but failed."
7980,"This is definitely the best of the DC animated movies thus far, (that's saying a LOT, btw), and is truly one to get excited about watching. But The artwork here comes across like a tribute to everything 1990s; in particular, that era of anime and Rob Liefeld. The film has a very epic, cinematic feel to it and the action scenes are amazing. Now, Bruce Wayne does not exist, WonderWoman and Aquaman are in the middle of world war three, and Cyborg is America's greatest law enforcer. All the battles are epic, characters are well portrayed and animation's very interesting with obvious anime influence."
7981,"The acting is impressive, the practical effects are perfect and the classic 70s feel Wan was going for make for a great time at the movies. It combines lots of the things that make traditional ghost stories so sinister â€“ an old house, a hidden room, a witch, tragic histories, possession, creepy old children's toys and, of course, well - placed jump scares. Particularly impressive are Vera (The Departed) Farmiga and Patrick (Hard Candy) Wilson who play the paranormal experts. As well as being more authentic to the story, this has the added benefit of having a retro feel that harks back to the classic 70's American horror movies in which it derives much of its influence. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are excellent at exploring their roles and whatever they do are totally intriguing."
7984,"your favorite X-men character fights and moves with the grace of a rock. your favorite X-men character gets totally owned by a. Â¿ corporate samurai? you have an awesome army of ninjas, yet in the end they decide to go on a sudden camping trip. the best scene in the film is a scene after the credits. (B) The black ninjas, doing their thing in the middle of the night and flying across roof - tops."
7985,"The films strongest point is the portrayal of realism in regards to adult relationships. Swanberg's script sets up situations in which a major conflict between the characters could break out at any second, but the film relies chiefly on its on - screen talent in order to work. "" Drinking Buddies "" completely and honestly captures the indefinable nature of contemporary relationships, it just doesn't say anything new about it. Long, realistic conversations with buddies, work colleagues and partners. She's hilarious and buoyant and handles her dramatic moments - however fleeting or quiet - with expert skill."
7986,"This is a movie for people who enjoy sitting back and being entertained by fancy camera work, a story that has a plausible plot, smart dialog (Jon and Erich Hoeber), astute direction (Dean Parisot), and most of all a cast of some of cinema's finest actors who look like they are having such a great time you don't want the at times rather silly movie to end. The characters remain strong thanks to the screenplay (Jon and Erich Hoeber) and the airy humour is consistent and keeps the violence grounded. They kept the same feel of cool, unreasonable stunts and explosions from the first movie, but they also added a lot more hand - to - hand combat, which was still very amusing to watch and excellently choreographed. The soundtrack and sound effects made all the guns and explosions that much more convincing and enjoyable."
7988,"Brad Copeland's Coffee Town is a simple, satisfying picture, not intent on being offensive or taxing, but more fixated on being a fun ninety minutes one can enjoy without the burden of being too explicit, too sentimental, and too self - satisfying. Many Kudos to CollegeHumor for that rare comedy that you'll probably want to watch again immediately after your first viewing so as to be better prepared for the onslaught of funny. The best thing about it however is it's writing, it is one of those movies that doesn't take itself too seriously and in that allows it to have quite juvenile humor. Which seems like a natural sentiment considering how much charm this movie derives from its relatability."
7990,"Cate Blanchett gives a stunning performance as a Blanche - like character written and directed by the most prolific American author of the last 40 years. Jasmine walks a very tight rope, her sense of despair etched in her magnificent face vanishes ipso facto when she meets Peter Sarsgaard. Because of Allen's enduring reputation, it will probably pick up an Oscar nomination or two (for Blanchett's performance and for Allen's questionably "" original "" screenplay) because Allen's name still carries cache with the taste arbiters. Woody offers up his distinct style of dialog in his screenplay and it's put to good use by Cate Blanchett who delivers one of her best career performances. As said before, Cate Blanchett may have given her best performance and that is a tough feat."
7991,"The story is wonderfully told both by images and dialogues. A special mention goes to Sabrina Ferilli and Carlo Verdone, two very famous actors in Italy, shining here in two supporting roles where both of them display their undisputed talent. Jep has self - reflection, he's honest, doesn't take things so seriously, and he doesn't try to convince himself that he's something that he's not. Sex with someone new is not something beautiful shared with another person for him, but simply an everyday thing that's part of his lifestyle. Jep tries to find "" the great beauty "" in life but hasn't found the greatest one of them all: love."
7992,"Louis C. K. does his HBO special in Phoenix. And for that, Louis C. K. seems eternally connected to the grotesque and the morbid, but it's all enwrapped over a positive message: appreciate life and what you have. The core of C. K.'s comedy is not the material itself. C. K. makes a point that being older makes a more intelligent and interesting person. His material comes from thoughts that most people have every day but never talk about, and the audience's secret familiarity with the subject matters makes laughing at them all the more relieving."
7993,"The next few scenes slightly follow the book in a way that it is good enough to pass. He was smart, spoke clearly, and was even attractive with two eyes. Therefore the only attractive character is Annabeth, gorgeous and strong. Rating: 6/10 Final Verdict: "" Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters "" is a decent sequel that provides plenty of action scenes and laughs, with passable acting and okay visual effects. Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) discovers the mystic Golden Fleece is capable to heal Thalia and save their camp."
7994,"The movie had some touching scenes that step - parents and step children will appreciate. Meanwhile, Gargamel now lives in Paris with his cat Azrael, and is a beloved magician in the city, playing to sold - out crowds every night. The look of the film is very pleasing with bright colors and tons of things happening on every part of the screen. ' THE SMURFS 2': One and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Sequel to the 2011 hit kids' film based on the popular comic - book (which was later turned into a popular cartoon series in the 1980s) by Peyo (a Belgian comic - book artist) about little blue people that live in mushrooms. The Smurfs 2 continues with the adventures of the adorable blue creatures called, Smurfs."
7995,"He's still cringe - worthy, particularly in scenes where he attempts to court a colleague, but none of the gags even scrape the surface of the programme's brilliance. There would be flashes of classic Partridge, but generally both the dialogue and slapstick comedy just died. The jokes and laughs keep flowing and whilst some miss the mark there are plenty of scenes that will have tears running down your face. Great to see Lynn & Micheal again, although there was not much of Micheal in the movie his scenes were still pretty funny."
7997,"If you enjoy Ip Man or you are one of those guys who watches Chinese movies with English subtitles. Hoping for a blu - ray DVD with lots of extras. Kudos to Tiger Chen for the amazing action sequences in this film as well in the other movies he had been in as stunt coordinator and the like. Yes, it does have a few stiff and / or formulaic moments but given the genre and it being a directorial debut, this was inevitable;) Also, in spite of the genre and the references / homages to other movies, Reeves' directing style is original. The careful use of blood highlights the storyline and does not drown it out especially the final fight that is pretty damn cool with Keanu Reeves as the baddest of the bad guys ever."
7998,"If you liked Wedding Crashers, or Hot Tub Time Machine, chances are you'll like this one, which was written by the 4 screenwriters who worked on those films. The 2 pairs of writers who have a history with comedy throw some subtle humor in the dialog which you probably won't get if you're not paying enough attention, which allows for every comedy lovers dream: To be laughing out loud, then hearing an ever so subtle joke causing you to laugh harder, then hearing another one and another and another. Recommended to anyone who enjoyed the previous works by the screenwriters. 90s songs and allusions pop up during this movie. Jennifer Aniston was just marvelous as always."
7999,"To make it simple, Grown - Ups 2 felt like the first, if you enjoyed the first one you will probably enjoy this. You have a choice as a moviegoer this weekend and the several other weekends Grown Ups 2 is going to play. Despite being universally panned by critics and movie goers, Grown - Ups managed to perform well enough at the box office to warrant a sequel. Adam Sandler can be funny when he is given timing and a decent character, Kevin James can always be sweet, simple, and relatable, Chris Rock is one of the funniest comedians working today, and David Spade almost always knocks one out of the park in Rules of Engagement. Say you refute that suggestion and want to see Grown Ups 2 as a pleasant, feel - good movie."
8000,"Kick - Ass is full of intense action and hilarious comedy, it is one of the best mixes and on par with other action - comedy films such as Hot Fuzz, 21 Jump Street and Tropic Thunder! From the variety of super heroes brought together by Jim Carrey's Captain Stars & Stripes to the frequent obscenities from 15 - year old HitGirl, Kick - Ass is an enjoyable film for fans of comedy, action and the superhero films! The action scenes are still pretty brutal and effective, but the humour lacks that razor sharp edge that made the first one so believable despite its premise. In spite of this, one character who stood out in a great way was Colonel Stars and Stripes who, in his mere seven and a half minutes of screen time, was an enormous bundle of interesting. If you liked the first film and want to see the storyline continued, this one is worth checking out if you're not expecting miracles."
8010,"Not only romances is magnificent, humor and drama are also far better than many Classics. With Heart touching soundtracks and songs, the movie has Eye pleasing Scenes. Performance, screenplay, dialogues etc all are first class. But the best is the Presentation of emotions which could be linked to every single person who ever Loved someone or just believes in. The movie begins with casual entries and remains a good entertainer till second half while in the last quarter (ending) it cross a bridge and steps in best movie category platform with a message of living."
8001,"The huge mass of predatory aliens only come out into the world when it rains, which apparently, judging from the desert - like conditions is extremely rare. Take the two proceeding movies: in Pitch Black what was ultimately fascinating was Riddick's interaction between Johns, Fry, and Imam; in CoR, his interaction between Vaako, Toombs, Aerion, and the slew of other characters. You know a movie is good when it makes you watch the previous movies when you get home from seeing it. This is a genuinely good movie, it follows on from the previous Riddick movies and doesn't leave anything to be desired."
8002,"Planes is a mixture of its direct - inspiration Cars, Monsters University, and the forgotten PBS Kids show Jay Jay the Jet Plane. Even with reminders of brighter, more vivid animated works, Planes is a middling Disney effort and clearly a corporate byproduct from Disney (not Pixar as many will assume) to sell merchandise to children, with the quality of the actual film being a clear afterthought. The film was originally conceived as a direct - to - DVD film and have a series of sequels follow accordingly. From toy cars, to diecast collectibles, to blankets, to bedspreads, to posters, to stray DVD short films featuring the characters lining store shelves, the marketing behind the Cars name was stunning and blatant. On an average, living - room - size Television, Planes probably looks pretty damn good."
8003,"This is a thought - provoking documentary on Tilikum, an Orca that has been at Sea World since 1983 and who is responsible for the death of 3 people (2 of his trainers, and 1 man who snuck into his tank). The basic message of this incredible documentary was that if you bring a wild and dangerous animal into an artificial world populated by people, be prepared for some repercussions. Well made and runs high on emotion, it will make the viewer contemplate on the scale of human tyrannism. Their experience working with Orcas - most having dedicated their lives to it - is truly heart breaking."
8004,"Hayao Miyazaki's latest movie The Wind Rises is one of his best movies till date though the story line and plot is completely different from all his other movies which had a magical and fantasy feeling to it. He ultimately succeeds in building fully up - to - date planes, but which went to war, and none came back. His personal life is set in Japan when people were facing great uncertainty after the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, the Great Depression, and preparation for the war with China, then America, and Britain, and Netherlands, and the Soviets. Miyazaki kind of neuters the militaristic history of Japan at that time. The least offensive performances come from Martin Short and Mae Whitman (the latter is a professional voice actress who is great on Avatar: The Last Airbender, though she is best known for her role as Michael Cera's dull girlfriend Ann on Arrested Development)."
8005,"In fact, the supporting acts steal the show, especially Mulroney's solid turn as Jobs' ally turned adversary. Most of all, Stern's film rarely possesses the qualities that characterised Jobs - it isn't bold enough to offer a balanced, or critical even, perspective of the man (including his more unsavoury personal aspects), nor unique enough to provide a distinctive look at the early years of his storied career. Steve Jobs is portrayed giving repeated quoted monologues instead of engaging in real dialog between himself and his co-workers to illustrate the chemistry of their relationships that lead to their success. To find a dramatic hook, Whiteley predictably focuses on the most pivotal turning point in Jobs' life, as Jobs' launch of the Macintosh computer in 1984 sparks off an internal feud with his CEO John Scully (Matthew Modine) and the rest of the Board (including J. K. Simmons' Arthur Rock) that leads to his ouster and the company's subsequent decline. It is an affected performance, and Kutcher's limitations as a dramatic actor are all too apparent here."
8006,"As well as multiple one - hit wonders of werewolf / vampire / demon shows that have come out since. This show had legitimate effects, great action scenes, and some really good acting performances. The demons were gruesome, scary, and awesome! When supposed humans turn to demons, this is done very well. On the whole, the fight scenes were very engaging, particularly the ending sequences."
8007,"With a talented cast of three (Rosemarie DeWitt, Emily Blunt, and the wonderful Mark Duplass) it was a favorable experience to say the least. Shelton asserted herself in human dialog, and immersed herself in the breathtaking beauty of Seattle's woodsy environment, making the film easy - on - the - eyes and very effective. So, while Abby's job begins to crumble before her eyes due to her newfound aversion to human skin, Paul's dentistry practices begin to flourish and the possibilities become endless on his part. Between Ellen Page, Allison Janney, and Rosemarie DeWitt, you have a great filmography between the three in which you will likely find the best drama or comedy movies of the past few years; and between DeWitt and Janney, you'll also find some of the best television of the past few years. Abby (Rosemarie DeWitt), a successful message therapist, and her boyfriend Jesse (Scoot McNairy) are enjoying a lovely dinner at her brother Paul's (Josh Pais) home."
8008,"There are clever casting choices (Jane Fonda as Nancy Reagan REALLY IS a hoot for anyone who knows their history) and while admittedly some of the actors playing presidents lack the visages of their famous characters, the acting itself defeats these deficiencies. What it is, is an exceptional, mature movie for those that want a little more than monsters (the fictional kind). Other than the strong performance by Whitaker, about the redeeming thing about the movie is that at least viewers are aware of the basic theme of the story, as fictionalized as it is, is that there was a butler of color that served eight presidents, was invited by one president to an official dinner, and got to see a man of color elected president. The casting of the presidents Cecil worked for is flagrantly weird."
8009,"This modest comedy takes place in the mini-world of people who do voice overs. The story line starts with boy meets girl, so you know how it will end, but there are enough unexpected twists and turns to hold your interest. Rarely will you go to a movie that offers so many mirrors of yourself to look into. It's so rare to see someone on the screen who can be more than one persona. Rob Corddry, who plays Lake's sister's husband, will tear your heart out."
8091,""" Camiel "" and "" Borgman "" is actually his job title, the etymologies of these names elude to the purpose he serves for Lucifer; his real name is given at the beginning of the movie, "" Anton "", which is believed to be a lie in an attempt to gain admittance to the house. Anton's actions and behaviors are most closely aligned with that of such mythical creatures of an alp or incubus. Later in the movie, his servants put on a play to entertain and honor Anton. The etymology of "" Anton "" is' priceless', so placing one's faith in Anton is synonymous with placing one's faith in something that is priceless, an obvious parallel to two of the' 7 Deadly Sins': idolatry and greed."
8012,"With Nicholas Cage, John Cusack and Vanessa Hudgens, Director Scott Walker has a heavy weight line up to help bring the events to life. The standout performance is of Vanessa Hudgens who portrays a teenage prostitute that managed to escape Hansen's clutches. The Frozen Ground is an interesting film and worth watching if you're in the mood for a thrilling bio-drama however it won't win any awards and certainly won't be a part of your' must see' collection. ' Frozen Ground' undeniably has promising storyline because of it's based on true story factor. Overall,' Frozen Ground' is a satisfying movie and above average of crime thriller."
8018,It was much less annoying or even apparent than in movies like Transformers.
8019,"This is a fine time at the movies but it does feel way too predictable and overly familiar. The direction makes it real simple, though it does pull off a little hipster - y animation when it shows their abstract feelings, but most of the time it just let it linger at the very meaningful moments. Like most movies of this genre, you can for the most part guess how this movie progresses. Engaging all the way through, and a wonderful showcase for its two stars, but perhaps that bit of subtext would have given this film more of a shelf life. All of them fit their parts very well and give the film its charm."
8020,"One with a superb performance by lead Hugh Jackman that challenges how far someone would / should go in an effort to locate their stolen child. Then, there's Jake Gyllenhaal as the second lead, playing an ambitious cop who holds a very impressive resume: no unsolved cases left under his plate. The script, from writer Aaron Guzikowski (Contrband) takes audiences down many different paths and emotional rides and Jackman's performance will have you rooting for his quest for answers even though his methods are unorthodox and highly illegal. Gyllenhaal still plays the role of a cop very well after all of that training for End Of Watch. When two young girls go missing, one belonging to Keller and Grace (Jackman and Bello), the other to Franklin and Nancy (Howard and Davis), a hot - shot detective (Gyllenhaal) is assigned to the case and relentlessly tries to find the clues that could lead to the whereabouts of the missing."
8021,"Where Bale brings a quietness to Russell, Casey Affleck brings the loud emotive bursts and the scrappiness of his youth to Rodney Baze, and the two work wonderfully in balancing the "" brotherhood "" aspect of the film. And finally, the bridge scene between Russell and Lena (Baze's girlfriend played admiringly well by Zoe Saldana) is one that gives a heart to a film that is otherwise dark and depressing. Likewise with Affleck, Harrelson and Saldana. Casey Affleck and Zoe Saldana deliver good work on screen."
8022,"Nevertheless, the place is lovely and the actors quite intriguing, especially one, Mr. Nobly (J. J. Field) who has the Darcy role. It has sumptuous costumes, a clever script, a wonderful setting, a skilled direction and enough references to the great lady herself to please most everyone. Her best friend makes a bet with her to give up her Austen obsession after Jane's trip to Austenland. Because Miss Charming is rich, she gets the luxury of choosing her own name and being part of the landed gentry and nobility of Austenland. Lady Amelia Heartwright, Colonel Andrews, Captain George East all are so ridiculous and entertaining."
8023,"Chris Hemsworth, an Aussie, does an excellent job on public schoolboy James Hunt, while Daniel Bruhl both sounds and looks frighteningly like the Austrian. Although the tracks are not the actual ones (for understandable reasons) the cars, the helmets, the sponsors are all authentic. For anyone interested in great personal stories, F1, the 70's, cars or just like to see a great film, then Rush is for you. The set pieces are well researched, the owners of some of the classic F1 hardware must have had an enjoyable time (not quite so sure about the Insurance Underwriters). The film is bang on in period, cars fashion and sets the tone excellently, the cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking and the fx are very much in keeping with the period, no ridiculous CGI."
8024,"unlike other gangster comedies, kinda like the ones that Guy Ritchie made, THE FAMILY does not show dumb bumbling criminals, the comedy in THE FAMILY banks on the short fuse and the temper that this Brooklyn family has, the violence exists because the reasons behind it are petty and that makes it funny. This movie is gleefully dark, wickedly funny and offers great acting from all the stars involved, (who really seem to relish their parts). Ditto for The Family - a zany comedy about a family of criminals, who come in all genders and ages. The interactions among the family are good, supportive and genuine. The plot is basically about a family, the Mazonis, that was relocated to Normandy under the witness protection program."
8025,"Credit goes to Mr. Cretton's quasi-documentary directorial style, tremendous acting from support characters played by John Gallagher Jr (Mason), Kaitlyn Dever (Jayden), and Keith Stanfield (Marcus), and a stunning lead performance from rising star Brie Larson (Grace). This is easily a star making role for Brie Larson, John Gallager Jr., and Kaitlyn Dever. It's a storytellers wet dream. Dever and Stanfield also deliver powerful secondary performances and each one of them shares a memorable scene with one of their counselors as they try to express their feelings through different ways: Marcus does so by rapping and Jayden by reading a story. If you see any films this month, makes sure this is one of them First time helmer Destin Cretton, with two years' experience in a similar care - giving facility (The title refers to the 12 or so group homes for teens in the county), has masterfully relayed the love and sorrow inherent in a place where virtually everyone is displaced from a parent, or abused, even the staff."
8026,"The film starts with quite a crafty opening credits sequence, which quickly lets you know that you're being brought back to the early nineties (1993 to be exact). And, throughout the film, this nineties feeling is very well kept alive, with the sets, the costumes, and such. Brandy is a straight A student with strong morals who has always succeeded at everything she tries."
8027,"He creates an intimate setting, even when driving cross-country or walking around an abandoned home, Payne keeps the story close and the responses authentic. All he has to do is buy these magazines and check if the numbers are his. It tells a story about an old man who is certain that he has won a million dollars and wants to get to Nebraska to collect it. "" Nebraska "" reaches an emotional conclusion that echoes of "" About Schmidt "" and "" The Descendants "" (2011) with an underlying sense of lives largely squandered, but handled with grace and finesse that feels innately genuine. The current major problem is that Woody has received something akin to a Publisher's Clearing House certificate telling him he's won a million dollars."
8028,"Interesting, intelligent and heart warming would perhaps be a fitting finale to the great James Gandolfini. On' SEINFELD' she was so self centered and unlikeable (like all of the characters on that show, except for Kramer) so it's really refreshing to see her be so adorable. However, Enough Said is still a very charming film with a mature look at adult love and second chances. Holofcener also helmed such critically acclaimed movies as 2010's' PLEASE GIVE', 2006's' FRIENDS WITH MONEY' and 2001's' LOVELY & AMAZING'. Gandolfini was incredible in this role, making you forget Tony Soprano or anything else he's done."
8045,"Since its enormous success, it has not only originated two high - quality sequels in 1999 and 2010, but it has also originated Pixar's very first television special called "" Toy Story of Terror "", which premiered this past Wednesday on ABC. While it may sound like it's taking the scares away from any adults watching it, it actually sets up some pretty light bits of humor for everyone to enjoy. Dalton and Shawn are fantastic actually, the parts of Rex and Mr. Pricklepants playing nicely to their strengths. Throughout the special, Mr. Pricklepants delivers dialogue about the traditional structure of the genre. After Mr. Potato - Head disappears, the toys investigate the dusty, cobweb - filled sub-flooring of the motel, Buzz' glow - in - the - dark paint casting an eerie green glow on everything."
8029,"Don Jon (2013) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Joseph Gordon - Levitt wrote, director and stars as Jon, a twenty - something man who loves women but what he loves even more is watching porn. Don Jon is one of those movies that has plenty of laughs and a few heartfelt moments, and it's certainly entertaining. It strikes as a solid balance between art and entertainment, it's filled with lots of laughs and it touches on a sensitive topic in a way that doesn't seem preachy. The film offers up a good amount of laughs, and the purposeful repetitive narrative works in showing Jon's changing lifestyle. But unlike Shame, which treats this topic in an intense, dramatic way, Jon keeps it light, funny, and tries to show how easy it is for someone to unknowingly fall into this addiction in today's sex - obsessed culture."
8030,"And Gondry added his touch: the visual effects are great, without CGI. The film starts off great, with the signature Michel Gondry style of bizarre visual feast."
8031,"It's rather puzzling therefore - after' Gone Baby Gone',' The Town' and' Argo' - what Affleck saw in Brian Koppelman and David Levien's script or in director Brad Furman to commit to star in this by - the - numbers thriller that arguably adds little to the cred he's built up so far. In spite of this, Affleck and his co-star Justin Timberlake are about the best things that' Runner Runner' has going for it. Soon Richie finds the truth about the disloyal Ivan and he has to find a way out to escape from Ivan and Shavers using his intelligence and money. Gemma Arterton does absolutely nothing but stand around looking pretty, plus she and Timberlake has absolutely no chemistry making the romance between them feel completely awkward. With the chance to join the super rich, all the pleasures it encompasses and, predictably, a beautiful woman, Rebecca (Gemma Arterton), who equally predictably is Block's girlfriend, Furst's life couldn't be any better."
8032,"There are countless of films about people falling in love, but when you see "" Blue is the Warmest Colour "". The movie owes so much of it's emotional power to its two fantastic actresses. The level of a good love story with all it's feelings and situations has been raised to a higher one. The film treats the love story, it's personal problems, the passion, but does not handle the problems which can have their family or friends, not in detail. "" Blue is the Warmest Colour is a naturalistic and touching film, whether you're gay, straight, bisexual, or whatever orientation."
8033,"The pirates board the giant ship, clearly pleased with their find. Matching him wit for wit while frantically trying to keep his own wits about him is Abdi as the skinny, intelligent Muse, seemingly a veteran of high piracy (though not against huge container ships). Truly a talent to look out for, Abdi nails this role. Captain Phillips delivers a tight, action - packed story fraught with none of the usual missteps of the genre, and if it is indeed rewarded with the highest of honors, it will be well deserved. This complexity of character is attributable in no small measure to the outstanding performances by veteran Tom Hanks and newcomer Barkhad Abdi, who earned an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his work here."
8034,"The Cohen brothers may have the monopoly on fantastic character names, but nobody writes actual characters like Welsh and the cast that Baird has poured into Filth is staggeringly good in their interpretation of this mess of freaks and misfits. His performance in Jon S. Baird's adaptation of Irving Welsh's Filth is astounding and there is nothing sweet or fluffy about it or any other aspect of the film. While none are bona fide Hollywood stars, the cast that glitters in a maniacal, dirty way is a treat beyond expectation: Imogen Poots, Shirley Henderson, Gary Lewis (yes, Billy Elliott and his dad are reunited at last!) With a promotion in the balance, Bruce is up against several colleagues and sets about turning one against the other, unsettling them with salacious gossip and blatant lies to ensure he beats them to the post. But if you want to face the World and its obvious problems head on (in the form of a film) then it is an outstanding film to do so."
8092,"They just want to have some fun while they are alive - and may be help others have fun as well. The story is so well done, it will carry you through the entire 113 minutes. Absolute jewel: D Stallone is 67 years old, and he is still the best. At the end though the two boxers duke it out but both go home a winner. However the film is a comedy and it has a good amount of laughs within it."
8036,"None of the young actors portraying the bullies are able to broadly paint their personalities on screen in a memorable or notable way. Her fresh - faced, squeaky - clean appearance throughout the film makes it's a hard swallow that Tommy (vacantly played by Ansel Elgort) could look at her wearing a dress and then suddenly be like "" Wow! "" She is a great choice for the role but the way she handled it, as well as everything else about this movie is - over the top. Chloe did deliver a chilling performance during the scenes where Carrie is exacting her revenge. As talented as Moretz is, she is a miscast for this movie."
8037,"With three of his novels being adapted into critically acclaimed films, Cormac McCarthy has opted to try his hand at screen writing, and the fruits of his labor can be seen in The Counselor. Directed by Ridley Scott, the film stars Michael Fassbender as a high - priced lawyer who decides to dabble in something a bit less than legal in order to make some extra cash. Motivated by the love of a beautiful woman (Penelope Cruz) and the desire to maintain the lifestyle he's enjoyed for so long, he never takes into account the sort of consequences he may be subjected to, should things not go according to plan. Ridley Scott's latest directorial effort is peppered with lengthy scenes that find The Counselor engaged in conversations with other characters as they try to impart kernels of wisdom, truth and philosophy. That such a perfect film was created to tell an abstract story will be a loss to some viewers but a gain to others."
8039,"Though Folman doesn't follow the book to the letter, the main character is female rather than male and the story of chemical dictatorship is changed to that of the film studio running the world, it does stay true to its core. Enough to say that the film is really original, well acted, with good production values and fantastic visuals. It's full of subtle humor that blends nicely with the depressed tone of the film, and you'll find yourself having a few good laughs when you recognize famous characters and actors as their cartoon avatars are presented. After going over all the poor choices she made over the years, he tells her how she can reap the rewards with never having to work again. Ari Folman, the Israeli director and writer of this film, creates one of the most anti-Hollywood and anti-Holocaust films in a while."
8040,"Paul Giamatti, Paul Dano, Benedict Cumberbatch, Sarah Paulson, Alfre Woodard are all great in relatively small roles. A fine ensemble of established and up - and - coming actors surround Ejiofor in his limelight - Paul Dano, Paul Giammati, Alfre Woodard, Sarah Paulson, even Brad Pitt and Benedict Cumberbatch, but none so ferociously as McQueen regular Michael Fassbender as the despicable, sadistic plantation owner Edwin Epps. Paul Giamatti and Sarah Paulson are seen for a few minutes but both are great as usual. Cumberbatch was very good, though outshined by far by Michael Fassbender. The sounds of nature as the slaves walk or as Solomon approaches his master's house is noticed."
8041,"CONTAINS SPOILERS - Outstanding performance, beautifully underplayed, gripping. It's great in its deliberate confinements. Then instead of securing the line, he holds it with one hand while untying the sea anchor from the container (which was minutes ago strong enough to pull the container away). Vessels have bilge pumps and EPIRB and pleasure yachts usually have also portable bilge pumps. All that said by the end you are really rooting for the guy and hope someone finds him."
8042,"Definitely see it in the theater if you can - the battle room scenes are best on a big screen. The film does not shy away from the brutality of the lives that these young recruits lead, at least not within the confines of a 12A film, and the ending is as shocking and moving as it should be. The actors are great, Asa Butterfield absolutely owns the role of Ender Wiggin, effortlessly switching emotional gears when needed. Harrison Ford as Colonel Graff is clearly having a lot of fun in this movie, it's the liveliest the actor has been in years. Other supporters like Abigail Breslin, Hailee Steinfeld and Ben Kingsley also bring a lot of charisma to the screen and make even small roles memorable."
8044,"Though giving the red umbrella (and the red umbrella alone, in a sea of umbrellas) extra long eyelashes and her human rain boots with 3 "" heels felt a bit unnecessary. The Blue Umbrella (2013) *** (out of 4) Fun short from Pixar, which was shown before their feature MONSTERS UNIVERSITY. PIXAR really outdid themselves with the hyper - realistic CGI in here, and the simple story of a blue umbrella falling for a red umbrella in a sea of indifferent, monochromatic umbrellas. This is but an example of the fact; that even after the mistake of' Cars 2', Pixar can return to it's roots; and make a truly beautiful short, that shows why Pixar beats all competition if it tries. This idea might seem quite simple but director Saschka Unseld does a very good job at making it move at a very good pace and also keeping the viewer interested in what's going on."
8046,"His grandson within the film, Billy, played by Jackson Nicoll, is awesome as well, managing to create some fantastic scenarios which will leave you in stitches. Jackass knows how to make pranks work, and here is easily their best work. Whilst not nearly the best comedy released in 2013, this is surely the funniest. As played by child actor Jackson Nicholl Irving's grandson Billy is the perfect foil for the antics the film sets up and Nicholl displays a rare ability for a child to think on a whim and more than once he will have you laughing hysterically with his verbal comebacks or physical comedy (A highlight being the trailer centerpiece and films ace up the sleeve beauty pageant routine). The purpose of the trip is to catch people's reaction to everything from stealing, destroying property, and even crashing a kid beauty pageant."
8047,"Hiddleston makes for a great Loki but that is literally the only good or interesting thing in the entire film. To be honest though Tom Hiddleston is too damn good in the Loki role to say the film is completely without merit. Hemsworth is as good as ever, as is Hiddleston, but apart from Portman, it appears that the rest of the cast have been sidelined, so Thor and Loki can carry on their war of nerves."
8048,"In this Netflix outing, however, the perfectly - titled Thinky Pain, he's straight out hilarious. Probably the funniest is how he is so self - reflective and can find the hardcore pain in the comedy of his situations. He also has a good intimate way of showing this to the audience, which is a small comedy club sized one, not a stadium or big arena like a lot of stand - up comedy concert movies."
8049,"Mature, if not sophisticated, beyond his years to be able to take on a brutish character like this with such fearlessness. While there may be a touch of melodrama with the theme of the mother's concern and the pacing it thrives off of seems unnatural, what makes the film work is that it still feels authentic in its performances and script. There are certain rough edges - Gilder's Kitten comes across as rather two - dimensional, while his wife Mary (Lorraine Ashbourne) is almost too good to be true - but the film is definitely worth watching more than once. The triumphs are the performances from the child actors, Connor Chapman all raw energy as the feral Arbor, and Shaun Thomas as vulnerable Swifty give genuinely moving performances. The two leads, as unknowns, are superb, as are all the child actors in this."
8052,"By the way: Mary Steenburgen is beautiful. How it shapes the weekend and Billy's marriage takes the film beyond Hangover and Bridesmaids. Director John Turteltaub and writer Dan Fogelman treat the hang - ups with gentleness, never extending to slapstick the important challenge of each life brought into relief by the trip. Last Vegas is an entertaining movie with a lot of truthfulness, and it gives all of its actors - all legends and Oscar winners - real moments to dig in and play something amazing. They have enjoyed much and suffered much in their lives, apart and together."
8069,"This film arrived in the UK with awards and Oscar nominations all around it, adding an expectation which it really didn't need adding since even without any of that it is ultimately a Scorsese film with a big name cast. It also arrives with some other stuff because the film has been criticized for near glamorization of the excesses that Belfort was able to experience with his ill - gotten funds and, to be honest, it is an impression that isn't helped when you consider that this film was put forward to the Golden Globes in the Musical / Comedy section. DiCaprio is great in the lead â€“ OK he doesn't find the heart of the character, but the film doesn't ask him to. Each shot also looks precise, even during some of the more chaotic scenes. The performances are also exquisite, especially Leonardo DiCaprio who gives one of the best performances of his career and portrays the opportunistic nature of Jordan Belfort's character with great commitment as you can see a lustful, hedonistic and impulsive sex & drug - addict man who only wants to have more fun."
8053,"Underlying all of this is an incredible story of an incredible man, Jerry Hall, a man born in numbing poverty who somehow managed to rise above poverty and numerous personal tragedies to produce some of the most incredible blues and rock and roll recordings of all time. Muscle Shoals is jammed full of great music, colourful characters and wonderful anecdotes. However, there's more to the film than that--it is quite interesting, has some surprisingly big name musicians who gave interviews (such as members of the Rolling Stones, Bono and some great R&B legends) and terrific music! All personal bias aside, present day interviews with music luminaries, expertly deployed found footage and stills, and the greatest soundtrack a movie could hope for, all make Muscle Shoals one of the finest music documentaries you'll ever see. Lots of great interviews and a kaleidoscope of personal memories from great entertainers, as well--including Mick Jagger, Aretha Franklin, Wilson Picket, and Alicia Keys, to name just a few."
8055,"The script is by Coogan and Jeff Pope and it beautifully encapsulates the book that Sixsmith wrote about Philomena Lee's search for the son who was taken away from her by Irish nuns and sold to an American couple simply because she had given birth out of wedlock at a time when such' sins' were considered almost unforgivable. As several critics have observed, this wonderful film, just shown at TIFF, is destined to become this year's King's Speech (which began its Oscar run in Toronto too, though Philomena has already picked up accolades in Venice). It's a heart - wrenching story but told with a good deal of natural humour and a distinct lack of lachrymation, (though you would need to have a heart of stone or no heart at all not to be moved to tears). All the performances are first - rate and in the title role Judi Dench is simply phenomenal. A very meaningful and poignant tale about what goes on in the heart of man and the secrets that can change lives if only known."
8056,"Best of all look for the answer to the many questions this film should leave in their minds. It gleams like the sun, glistens like rays on the surface of water - for here is a dark tale that lights up the very soul. From the very opening scenes this film draws you in. As is talented Director: Brian Percival (Downton Abbey & North and South) Both seem to have given their all, and with no less than 6 various producers, there seemed to be plenty of money to assure superb production values ~ guaranteeing a great look and feel. Director of Photography: German born Florian Ballhaus, captures the magnificence of the carefully selected locations, lifting astounding images from the pages of the book onto the screen."
8057,"This, and the quite audacious camera angles, the ever so close close - ups that only half a face remains visible. So yeah, the movie is worth it's weight on that alone already, and then there is Agata Kulesza, so absolutely right every part of her role as Aunt Wanda, so whole and complex inside a movie that doesn't otherwise spend lengths on character's backgrounds that she just draws you inside, whether you know her story, her past, her issues or not. Even more effective is Agata Kulesza as Ida's bitter and alcoholic Aunt Wanda. Agata Kulesza (Wanda) and Agata Trzebuchowska (Anna / Ida), are immensely talented actors."
8070,"It tells the events in the way they have done but also goes pretty in - depth as to what Mandela was like and it was the point in the movie where it didn't seem like he was fighting for Black rights alone, he was fighting for equality on both parts. It looks good with attention to period clothing and artifacts and use of actual sites and some breathtaking countryside (it was shot entirely on location in South Africa). Yet, allowing for all of this, by any standards "" Mandela "" is a success, telling a powerful story in a honest and immensely moving manner with some outstanding acting. A reviewer was right when he said Chadwick had done a by - the - numbers job on it."
8060,"Making one highly resilient warrior, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), a revered folk hero risking everything for love. Josh Hutcherson gives a decent performance as well, playing the confused - from - love - and - fame Peeta. Josh Hutcherson though, put in a better performance. As an important example, the idea of poisonous fog is a brilliant one, but the chase between the spreading fog and Katniss and her allies is not thrilling or even believable at all. This overly computer - generated switch - up, attempting to raise stakes from the original, ultimately leaves the audience â€“ both within the film's game show and inside your local theater â€“ nothing and no one to actually root for."
8061,"The movie tries hard to change the story wherever it can, reducing fan - favorite chapters to 5 minute scenes and writing new content that feels out of place. There are random action scenes every 10 minutes and' funny' decapitations every 30. Perhaps Peter Jackson thought his cast of Dwarfs wasn't good enough to create an enjoyable movie? Gandalf's scenes in Dol Guldur were an interesting addition in concept, but they are just too slow. The story is full of illogicalities."
8062,"Some genuinely emotional moments and serviceable action and effects make this a good but flawed film. Although the film contains some great visuals, sets, music and costume design, infusing the story with fantasy elements and some new characters in an attempt up the action and appeal to a global audience is it's greatest weakness. Casting Reeves as the outsider allows him to do what he does best: play the role with stony - faced reserve, whether he's levelling up by battling demons in cage matches or pining moodily after Mika. Their reactions provide some of the most emotionally resonant moments in the entire film. Contains mild spoilers: For those who aren't familiar with the 47 Ronin, this film does it's best to bring the legend to the rest of the world."
8063,"Against the advice of her lawyer best friend Brett (Chris Pratt), and while trying to mend the relationship he has with his girlfriend Emma (Cobie Smulders), David decides to set out and see how his children turned out. Definitely worth at least one watch, if not for Vince Vaughn then definitely watch it for Chris Pratt because even if this movie isn't just a straight odd ball comedy it's definitely got it's funny moments and all mostly revolving around Chris Pratt and his Attorney at Law bit. The film starts out with some nice comedic moments from Vince Vaughn's character playing the typical immature adult. Apart from his serious moments, Vaughn also has fun chemistry with Chris Pratt who plays his best friend. It is a major treat to see him interact with some of the youngsters who play his children."
8064,"Oh, and Rupert Grint AKA Ronald Weasley also has a humorous minor role as well. Nigh on impossible to categorize, kookier than a Tim Burton Halloween party, an at times borderline incoherent shambles and a film destined for a life time in the Cult selection of cinema, Fredrik Bond's energetic and unique The Necessary Death of Charlie Countryman is an absolute blast of fresh air that despite all its many faults and inadequacies is a film well worth tracking down for its undeniable charms and ability to never conform to expectations. A fine debut film by director Bond and a role that shows LaBeouf can in fact act and act well, Charlie Countryman should be sort out but perhaps not by Harry Potter fans who wish to remember Ron Weasley as a clean cut ginger wizard not a budding adult movie star called Boris Pecker. Charlie's journey to Bucharest is undertaken because his dead mum told him to go there and once there the story continues to surprise, frustrate and involve in equal measure and Bond has such a keen eye for not only the eye - popping visual (a scene where Charlie and his new friends Luc and Carl played by the Inbetweeners Buckley and a very naughty wizard in the form of Grint first party a particular highpoint) but a great feel for the pace and structure of the film that you can't help but go along with all its craziness and you'll find yourself asking internally "" since when has Shia LaBeouf been so tolerable? "" In a role that showcases a talent that is missing far too often in his other projects LaBeouf delivers here in what could be his best role outside of kids classic Holes."
8065,"The final scene with all the Doctors is wonderful, an awe - inspiring, loving homage to the series. To have Steven Moffat as show runner and his magnificently brilliant staff putting together these complex, intricately plotted episodes, it is a delight to be alive to see it. It is a tribute to all the doctors from past, present and future and combines humour, emotion and brilliance in a fabulous concoction. This is an amazing episode that will be cherished, revered, and most of all, REMEMBERED, in the many years to come. The TV show lasts one hour and fifteen minutes, a perfect length and is full of twists and turns and brilliant fan service and dialogue."
8066,"The story is heart melting, filled with the pure feeling and heart that has become a staple with the best Disney movies. The comedy hits right on the mark and the action packed adventure and thrilling journey make this a tale with a little bit of everything in the exact right amounts. It is a daring movie that is laugh out loud at the some moments and stunning and provoking at others. Gorgeous visuals, stunning backdrops and intricacies like you have never seen before. among many others bring winning charm, superior voice acting and magnificent vocals as well as heart to this tale."
8068,"So while the songs are real and the characters are often inspired or based upon real artists of the time, Llewyn's story is pure Coen fiction. Carey Mulligan (as Jean) has one of the film's best and most insightful lines when she tells Llewyn he is "" King Midas' idiot brother "". Oscar Isaac is exceptional as Llewyn Davis. Instead, brace yourself for the trials of a talented musician who believes the music should be enough. There are oddly poetic scenes in the film."
8073,"So refreshingly real, and so much talent on all sides, actors included. Of course, Paul Giamatti and Paul Rudd are great as always, as is British Sally Hawkins (see Mike Leigh's' Happy - Go - Lucky', Woody Allen's' Blue Jasmine', etc.), playing a Polish immigrant with a heart as big as her accent. His wife, Therese (Amy Landecker) is now sleeping with another man, Rene (Rudd). Giamatti is definitely less likable in the movie and is pretty hard to like but both of their characters have their hearts in the right place. If you're expecting big laughs this isn't the movie for you but it is a decent emotional buddy film."
8074,"In the late 1970s, while America was swinging to rock n roll, exposing all its flashy jewelery over plunging necklines and under unruly hairdos, a scandalous entrapment planned by the FBI threatened several political figures and rocked the nation in its most oddly alluring time. This highly fictionalized version of the Abscam sting by the FBI has some meaningful conversations, witty dialogue and glorious nonsense in its overlong narrative. In an era of resurgent wealth and dynamic lifestyles, success is achieved with compelling ambitions amidst increasing competitiveness, only through some hustle. Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), initially suspicious of Irving's businesses, soon becomes his partner in bed and crime. This movie, while containing decent acting performances for the most part, was difficult and just not very enjoyable to watch."
8075,"Accompanied by a truly beautiful soundtrack, Oscar - worthy camera work, and the surprisingly able acting of Ben Stiller, as well as an accompanying cast which includes Adam Scott, Kirsten Wiig and Sean Penn, among others, this is heart - warming and truly special. It was wonderfully refreshing to see a character, despite his quirks, find happiness in the midst of just being, well, a good guy. This is a film that may not resemble the source material verbatim, but the spirit is clearly alive, with a few touches to modernize the idea. The pathos of the main character is well - captured in subtle ways, as are the feelings of triumph when he is able to go beyond his own self - imposed limitations. Ben Stiller has created some entertaining comedies, but' Walter Mitty' is by far his most audacious piece of direction so far."
8076,"Like love and thoughts and emotions. One of the best scripts ever written. He delivers such a powerful and emotional performance and the close ups are there to capture it all. They also make great use of the natural backlighting of Shanghai, and the colors all fuse to make it a really pretty movie. Everything about it was so beautiful."
8077,"Although he began as a lyricist, the genesis of "" Something's Coming, "" clearly show that it is HE who is the driving force behind the song. And there is also quite generous footage of the some of the shows he was a part of either as lyricist or composer. This is a wonderful documentary, composed chiefly of interviews Stephen Sondheim has given in the past, with the addition of the musical numbers, some specifically filmed for this HBO documentary. These three actors have the charm and innocence and musical presence that was required of the original roles, and they recreate the period and excitement with thrilling results."
8079,"The film opens with actual footage of the over the top training and stress imposed on elite fighting units such as the Navy Seals. A lot of people will argue about what the choice should have been, and how it might have changed the soldiers chances of survival. Suddenly, right in the middle of this intensity of revulsion towards "" terrorists "" there is an incredible emergence of human dignity, beauty, that lifts the film upwards, that changes the whole narrative of the film from soldiers captured inside a desperate fight to stay alive, toward the greatest attributes of human society; that of respect and refuge, of personal honor and dignity even in the face of the most terrible events. Lone Survivor stands as an outstanding account of bravery and comradeship under fire, with acts of selflessness abounding. Lone Survivor (2013) A more - or-less accurate depiction of four highly capable SEAL soldiers dropped into enemy territory in Afghanistan."
8081,"It's appeal, whilst obviously aimed towards adolescents, is genuine. Their motivations behind their decisions and their priorities--what is important to them and what (and who) they care about is what makes them and their stories so compelling. It's messages are simultaneously subtle and prominent--and there are many that audiences can take from it. However, the liberties that the screenplay writers took with the book's rich content were mind - boggling. Geography Club is a colorful film that challenges societal norms and simultaneously calls attention to the stereotypes that weigh on humanity."
8082,"Colin Farrell is on his best form for years as Travers Goff, the drunk father who lives in his own fantastic world of imagination and adventure to escape the harsh reality of the real world. There is a magical thawing in her Travers in the course of Saving Mr. Banks where she pokes her head out of her hard, crispy chrysalis and threatens to become a warm (ish), witty woman. Her rendition of a tetchy and cantankerous author who's plagued by the memories of her past is brilliantly executed. What makes this movie work more than anything else is the screenplay that didn't start in the studios of Disney, allowing for a more accurate portrayal of the true story behind the making of the masterpiece Mary Poppins ---- even if the entire world knows that with the backing of Disney some details will be left out. Saving Mr. Banks is the story of her battles with Walt Disney, who wants the rights to the film adaptation, in a dramatic comedy that is both witty and sentimental."
8083,"Still not sure who thought this was a good idea, it's like eating a McRib when you can have Korean BBQ, which one sounds better to you. Olsen provides a surprisingly warm emotional centre to the movie, especially in portraying the love angle between her character and Joe - which happens to be one of the ancillary additions Protosevich has brought to this adaptation. "" Oldboy "" serves as a stark reminder with only a few exceptions: Americanized remakes of beloved and admired foreign films inevitably result in disappointment. The original film achieves a sublime blending of ultra-violence with extreme art, while the remake feels bogged down in its copycat status, and its overall lighter tone hampers its enigmatic, disconcerting story of revenge. In 1993, the alcoholic Joseph "" Joe "" Doucett (Josh Brolin) is a loathed man with basically one only friend, Chucky (Michael Imperioli), who owns a bar."
8084,"AM1 was silly, and sophomoric but it held together based on a cohesive, simple story line that was made funny by the characters. The first film was very close to comedic perfection; it had everything that was needed and much like any film that you thoroughly enjoy you want to see more, but in the back of your mind you don't want the film to become tainted. Happy Days coined the term "" jumping the shark, "" generally used for a television show that is declining in quality and attempts to use an outrageous plot device to keep viewer's interest."
8085,The wagons themselves have amazing character. 7: People take loosing their limbs SHOCKINGLY well in this movie.
8087,"If you like David Lynch, Alejandro Jodorowsky, etc. - films that go over the top with their surrealism and absurdity, films that never feel quite comfortable and familiar yet which you can't look away from, you will love this film. Wrong Cops is a movie you should also be in the mood for the first time you see it. Dupieux's films collectively are like a breath of fresh air in a stodgy and self - important film culture. Its best for when you don't have time for the usual 1hr45 - 2 hr run time movies that are the norm these days. It seems to take influence from Reno 911 and Super Troopers."
8094,"However, it is also wickedly smart, beautifully shot, filled to the brim with talent and full of cultural witticisms. Tom Hiddleston is Adam, Tilda Swinton is Eve and Jim Jarmusch is a genius. If you were to ask the least - gifted film - maker on earth what he would do to try and liven up the dialogue of a two world - weary, wise old vampires, he would probably confidently reply' They could talk about all the awesome people they've known throughout history! The characters are well rounded and very easy to empathize with, which is surprising for a couple of centuries old vampires. The sets are rich and perfectly put together, the performances are flawless from each and every member of the cast no matter how long their involvement."
8096,"In few words if you are a fan and watched everything that came out in from this series you will love what this movie offers, otherwise it will seem just a plot less movie! DBZ: Battle of the Gods is a totally hoot with really nice animation, really cool battle scenes, fun & lively characters, and a ton of cameos and references for fans of the series to enjoy. Anyway, it's definitely a great addition for DBZ fans. So if you're a fan of DBZ, chances are likely you'll have a pretty good time here. Toriyama's SSG design was fantastic, and Bills is up there with Broly as one of the more interesting villains!"
8097,"The acting performances are top notch creating a convincing scenario between these families. Koreeda has always been good with handling fun and deep family stories with underlying conflicts. As always in Koreeda films the children are the biggest reasons for enjoying his films. With each film that the modern - day equivalent makes, the comparisons will continue to grow and grow, as his films maintain the theme of contemporary family life in Japan. His equivalent, Yudai, raising his biological son, has a more relaxed approach to life, raising his son in a loving, family environment."
8105,"Most abusers are able to hide it well and live normal lives with it only being a dark secret in the families. She basically gives them her blessings with her touch. Throughout the film Neve has this odd whistle and her ears ring, causing her pain."
8106,"Like all rom - coms, YEH JAWAANI HAI DEEWANI sparkles with romance, merriment and heartache, is brightly glossy and boasts of crackling chemistry between its lead actors, but Ayan makes sure the heady concoction never waters down. A wonderful cinematic experience, this one should strike a chord with not just the youth, but cineastes of all age - groups. The story begins with flashback and there are some moments of excitement. its 3 hrs of weddings n dancing n nonsense beautifully combined in such a way that you'd be proud of man's skill in recreating hell on earth. N u have Deepika playing a geek who transforms into a happening super cool lady in a single day."
8110,"With help from their mother Kat (Robyn Malcolm), and childhood friend Gus (Aaron Glenane), they start a surf shop in their backyard garage, making custom - made wetsuits and new surfboards. Their success and hard work comes at a price though as they deal with members of the community who are not ready for their innovative ideas and trouble from a violent bikie gang. Xavier Samuel, in one of his best performances, brings charisma and energy to his role. The film does a great job of bringing the 70's back to life. You gotta love JB's colourful bus and the classic kombi vans!"
8114,"As unbelievable as it sounds to them, the purpose of both the film and the sex scenes go much deeper. So much attention is being given to the number of penises shown (many, in a very funny way) and the number of vagina close - ups (none, in fact, at least in part 1) that it overshadows everything else, including the creative way the film is made. ' Nyphomaniac' is a classic frame story. Their conversation is the backbone of the film - the side stories about Joe's sex adventures and Seligman's hobbies are divided into chapters. The way Von Triers visualizes this, with the screen split in three to show cross cuttings of the organ and the lovers, is original and funny at the same time."
8115,"Directed by Denis Villeneuve (director of Incendies & Prisoners), Enemy is an ambitious work from the director who, of lately, has been steadily rising as one of the filmmakers to watch out for and is another fine feature in his bag. The writing makes a fine adaptation from the novel it's based on but also infuses more allegories & symbolism in the form of spiders into the script to keep the viewers guessing from start to finish. Performances by the cast is very good with Jake Gyllenhaal playing the college professor & his lookalike movie actor with fine subtlety & the contribution by the supporting cast is strong as well. The symbology and images used to tell the story like the use of spiders is great. What works in Enemy is Gyllenhaal's fearless performance as a man who is searching to find who he really is."
8119,"While not action packed like Italian Job or movies of the sort, it was still a great watch. Most of this cast is Canadian, and top quality, it is a nice change really to not have just one, or two big name Canadians, then just a lot of fresh faces. It has enough twists and turns to keep you hooked till the end and delivers a nice sense of humor throughout the whole movie. If you like Jay Baruchel's acting, you'll get some great scenes with him too. Also Some pretty funny scenes and exchanges, especially if you watch the outtakes in the credits."
8120,
8121,"This movie is actually pretty funny if you know LARPers. There are some great characters, and great "" in - story "" world - building by the LARPers, but it all degenerates into a big slug-fest with a rubber - suit monster. After all, it had three of the most recognizable names of the time: Steve Zahn whose acting chops have been untouchable since his first theatrical appearance, Ryan Kwanten who was staring in one of HBO's biggest episodic dramas; and Peter Dinklage, who at the time had become one of the biggest breakout stars of HBO's newest, most popular episodic drama at the time. While not the complete case here, "" Knights of Badassdom "" definitely needed another draft or two on its script. Peter Dinklage is wonderful as usual and Summer Glau's performance - she was was fantastic."
8122,"The script, apparently simple, is a jewel with many shining facets, a brilliant movie translation of a witty stageplay inspired by a meaningful and modern book. Thanks to the brilliant connections between literature, stage and reality, and thanks to the many things that remain unclear about the character's real identities and motivations, this movie sounds much more like a question than like a an answer: some kind of Rorschach spot to test the opinion of the audience about the relationships between a man and a woman, between the lover and the beloved one. The denouement comes when Vanda throws the author's cell phone across the room and breaks it after she has "" forced "" him to call his fiancÃ©e and let her know that he is not coming home and the delicious end as Vanda makes her retreat in her dance of victory and her subject is left to his bewildered and sensual dreams. Lars von Trier should watch this and learn how a theatrical drama shot on a small stage with nothing more than stage lights and a bit of fog can become a feast for the eyes. This movie is easily the best film he has made in the last 30 or so years."
8124,"In some not - so - distant, sparkly - bright dystopian future, brilliant and determinedly solitary mathematician Qohen Leth (Christoph Waltz) suffers through the tiny indignities of daily life. But, within these archetypes, The Zero Theorem finds something fascinating to say. He is hilariously effective when called upon to wriggle into a skin - tight virtual - reality costume, and devastatingly heartbreaking in the moment when Qohen refuses a chance at freedom and happiness to stay locked into the dark, nihilistic world in which he lives. Swinton, meanwhile, is a hoot as Dr. Shrink - Rom, Qohen's at - home, virtual psychiatrist, fumbling through their sessions with tons of blustery, false cheer. The special effects are mostly wonderful, and the neon - coloured world through which the black - clad Qohen stalks practically bursts at the seams with detail and imagination."
8128,"Some layers, twists, and reversals, but it's still very easy to follow and, therefore, may be a little too episodic and simple for some tastes. Though it doesn't try for anything big, COLD COMES the NIGHT accomplishes all it sets out to do and is a very watchable little film. Lucky, Chloe is good friends, with the corrupt young sheriff, who kept the motel arrangement afloat."
8130,"It is to LaBruce's great credit that he treats this controversial subject with just the right amount of restraint, avoiding the lurid, but not being afraid to call a spade a spade. This movie is a charming and unpredictable insight into a sub-world which is not just French - Canadian but universal, and will be a welcome addition to the programmes of those art cinemas brave enough to show it. Mr. Peabody was excellent in his portrayal of an older man who is at first resigned to life in the nursing home and then perks up when he realizes this young man is interested in him. In terms of storyline, this is an interesting film, told in a linear, non-confusing fashion. But there's precious little of it in this film: the very handsome Lajoie provides just one quick shot of his bare backside (and it seems unlikely the full - frontal shots of Borden will excite anyone except, y' know, gerontophiles)."
8135,"They all try really hard to get laughs, whether it be by forcing out swear words or resorting to penis and boob jokes that come across more than a little forced. The simplicity of the plot wouldn't have garnered a watch in most cases, but there are a few scenes with JCVD that are hilarious. This is a miraculous gem of a movie that achieved the near impossible by eliciting at least half a dozen deep belly laughs by being a very low budget movie starring you know who. If you're looking for some laughs and to see Jean Claude van Damme being hilariously ridiculous then this movie is good for a watch. The music and imagery in the movie are well done, and do set the mood for the various scenes, regardless of how the acting was."
8138,"Although this is a documentary about the world's greatest scientific undertaking, there's no need for those who've abandoned hope of understanding physics or other advanced sciences to roll their eyes and move on. Perhaps the best feature of the film is its clarity about the underlying difference between science and other human pursuits like religion or politics. The Large Hadron Collider is a gigantic experimental apparatus, conceived in an attempt to discover the fundamental particles that make up the universe. Put another way, they admit that "" truth "" is a relative term, dependent on the context in which the term has been employed; this knowledge lies at the heart of all "" artistic "" endeavors as well. Ultimately PARTICLE FEVER is an uplifting film that demonstrates the value of common research, and how it can be conducted across all platforms and all disciplines."
8140,"Colin and Violet enjoy betting each other on the pettiest of prospects (i. e. how a bar patron chooses to ogle the bartender), and they see an opportunity to have some fun with Craig and Vince. Two rich sickos torturing a couple of poor strangers by daring them to do progressively twisted tasks could result in an exploitative B - movie designed to shock the audience for the sake of it. The film stars Pat Healy and Ethan Embry as two old friends who, while commiserating over their extreme financial woes, meet a rich, thrill seeking couple, played by David Koechner and Sara Paxton, that derive enjoyment from making wacky bets involving risky dares and large amounts of money. He hits the local bar on the way home from work and sees an old high school buddy (Ethan Embry, in an against - type role that completely works) and the two meet up with a strange couple that wants to have a drink with them (David Koechner and Sara Paxton, who are both deliciously hilarious and mysterious). On the way home, he runs into an old friend at a bar, and the two of them run into an eccentric rich couple played by David Koechner and Sara Paxton (again of The Innkeepers) who propose a twisted series of games for money at their private residence."
8142,"It can be artistic, and different, and entertaining without following the well established formula for modern movies. Sometimes people try to make moody, interesting, thought provoking, different kinds of movies and just don't do a great job."
8153,"If you're one of the people who thought that tampon - sharing and anal fissures were underexplored topics in contemporary cinema, or cinema in general, here's a film that gives you a nod and a thumbs up. During the recuperation, she starts a flirtatious relationship with a cute male nurse (Christoph Letkowski) and attempts to use her hospital stay to reunite her divorced parents (Meret Becker and Axel Milberg)."
8146,"The storyline allowed for a lot of funny moments and the movie definitely ran with it. With some heartwarming moments, this movie is more than just a rude comedy. Despite his crass approach to everyone and everything around him, Bateman's Trilby is someone you can't help but like; this is certainly in no small part due to Bateman's overall likability as a person and an actor. Each character Trilby interacts with, whether it be for an extended period of time, or just shortly, Bateman nails each and every scene with a natural sense of arrogance. People just love to ruin good entertainment for others."
8149,"For a film that seemed to come out of nowhere, with a limited advertisement campaign and small budget, Starred Up has proved to be one of the more ballsy pictures released in some time - and with a UK release date sandwiched between two major blockbuster sequels, it had to do something to stand out from the crowd. All in all however, Starred Up is one of the best prison dramas in a long time, and probably the best British film this year. After a while, pretty well everyone is negatively affected in some way because of his arrival and actions, including his father and others trying to help him; however, the important question in the narrative apparently is whether he will have a reconciliation with his equally messed - up father. Like many British movies, you get the feeling that the actors are really the characters. The storytelling really hits hard in a gritty and unashamedly uncompromising fashion, develops the remarkably complex characters beautifully and never holds back or take any prisoners, while bleak and violent it's effective in showing prison life's brutality and never trivialising it."
8151,"The most arresting scenes are when Matt loses it with Tom - they feel very real and you know you are watching that fraternal relationship that has a lot of history. One of the most real movies you may ever see. This is the story of Matt Berninger, lead singer of the National's younger brother (by 9 years) Tom attempting (and succeeding) to make a documentary of the band on tour."
8156,"Very good description of the joy and energy of youth that are just beginning to form strong friendships, stand up for themselves (and each other) and explore their creativity and define themselves interacting with the world. Hedvig plays classical guitar, very well, and she's also a social outcast. The dialogue is really believable; and the three lead performances are super natural. Not these three passionate young 13 year old girls Bobo, Clara and Hedvig. After years of apparently making dark art films, Director Lukas Moodysson has made something here which encapsulates the spirit and energy of youth and punk."
8160,"It not only tells the story in an interesting way, it also compliments the main theme of the film. At some points the story is getting so intense and interesting and then BLAM! The entire cast gives strong performances, and you actually care about the well being of these characters. Smart, clever "" little "" films - a few characters, a few props and lots of chills and thrills. Good performances from all including the kids."
8169,"Very interesting and a decent film for the family--even with its many references to urine, testicles and the like. The sensitive storyline includes many layers that give it texture, which makes it such a rich movie and exiting journey for the audience. There have been some outstanding child performances this year including that of Tye Sheridan, Liam James, Kacey Mottet Klein, and others, but none better than little Sitthiphon Disamoe's in Kim Mordaunt's The Rocket. Mordaunt however excels at capturing the beautiful and at times scary images of the country and his direction of Disamoe and also young actress Loungnam Kaosainam as Ahlo's friend Kia is exemplary, a fine achievement for an Australian director in what is an area that often trips up other compatriots. Thankfully he layers the unavoidable political notes with real warmth, humour and character, a quality that clearly benefited from using a mix of professional and non-professional actors."
8170,"Robert Gustafsson, playing Allan, is just turning 50, but here he looks perfect both in the twenties, the thirties and as 100 years old. A mixed audience, with surprisingly many pensioners, which have read the book, will probably guarantee the film to be an even bigger success than the novel. Other films it's in class with here would be "" Fargo "", "" One night at McCools "", "" Seven psychopaths "" a. s. o. It's a good farce, which will give out many laughs. A success that has spread to a lot of other countries as well."
8171,"All forms of dialogue are from Locke and from calls he gets ingoing and outgoing through the car. Everything flows so smoothly and Tom Hardy's performance completely captures everything you'd expect from this character as he's experiencing these dilemmas - you believe every word out of his mouth and every subtle nuance in his expressions. It's incredible that a movie at only 82 minutes can go through such a roller - coaster of emotions, and as short as it is the movie still flies by because you're so drawn to the character. One of the voices is Locke's coworker voiced by Andrew Scott (Moriarty from Sherlock) and even as a voice - over his performance is totally convincing and his back - and - forth with Hardy is electric and at times humorous. His wife and other parties bring drama into the equation and as things start falling apart for Locke it dips into psychological thriller territory."

8174,"Credit for that goes of course to director Frank Pavich, but let's be honest: he couldn't have had a more enjoyable subject than Alejandro Jodorowsky, who turns out to be a master story teller. What makes all this so captivating are the interviews with Jodorowsky himself, and his incredible passion as he recounts the tale of an unfinished project from 40 years ago. In 1975, Alejandro Jodorowsky got a group of "" warriors "" together to make the film version of Frank Herbert's' Dune', and the way he did this (or the way he tells he did this) is so outright unbelievable and entertaining that it simply must be true (actually, there's an amazing story for another film right there). Entering into Jodorowsky's world is like falling into a visionary dream where anything and everything is possible. In the mid 70's Chilean director Alejandro Jodorowsky (best known for his trippy cult western El Topo and the mind bending The Holy Mountain) set out to make a film based on Frank Herbert's seminal classic, but long thought unfilmmable sci - fi novel Dune, even though he had never read it."
8175,"The patriarch of the family is a justice of the High Court of England and takes on an important case regarding a slave trading ship while confronting the reality of limitations faced by his mulatto niece. Gugu Mbatha - Raw, who plays Belle, did an outstanding job of portraying the character in her struggles and self - realization. If Belle is playing in your area and you love period movies, you shouldn't let this one pass you by. While her uncle and aunt (Emily Watson, Breaking the Waves) treat her as if she were their own â€” they raise her alongside their other niece, Elizabeth Murray (Sarah Gadon, A Dangerous Method) â€” social conventions of eighteenth century society are immovable; no matter how much they love her, Dido feels the sting of being forced to eat with the servants, when company comes calling. Gugu Mbatha - Raw as Dido is not only visually stunning but theatrically breathtaking."
8176,"James Gray's beautifully shot 1920s New York period drama about the American dream gone to seed for a Polish woman, never stumbles into soap opera melodrama and the film is actually restrained considering the heaps of drama thrown at this woman. Marion Cotillard gives a wonderful performance as the immigrant who finds herself exploited in prostitution and the script wisely never makes her blind to the fact that things will be quickly heading south for her - she's a strong, smart woman who's hostage to a miserable situation. While Cotillard, Renner and the rest of the cast give performances that feel natural and embody these characters, it always feels like Phoenix is acting. Though locations are minimal and the few exterior shots are usually in a tunnel, the period detail is convincing and it's a nice too see a period film actually shot on film instead of digital. The Immigrant is a good showcase for Cotillard's talents and despite its flaws, definitely worth a watch."
8180,"The quietness is very intense in this film and you focus everything on the characters. The directing by Jeremy Saulnier was handled expertly and was feast for the eyes. There are scenes that will make you squirm and there are humorous tension releasing moments, that is how tight the script is you are relived that you have those moments. The gamut of emotions that run through Dwight's (Macon Blair) eyes alone is worth the price of admission. There are some great actor finds and also some actor re-found here."
8186,Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley play producer and song writer who team up to make a demo filmed all over the city. The songs are pleasant and the characters are sympathetic and likable even Hailee Steinfeld as Mark's daughter. She doesn't have the most powerful voice but her singing is musical and right for the type of songs. Nice cameo by Ceelo Green and Adam Levine who sings quite a few songs. Movies like this are pleasant and uplifting to watch - if you want a break from action or violence of summer blockbusters.
8190,"This movie has a very strong touch of pure Love and emotions. The two begin talking and soon strike up a fast friendship that over the course of the day evolves into something that makes them question everything. Marrying someone is not the only thing to carry out your relationship but giving time, care, love, attention, purity, respect, trust, understanding must be there, otherwise, they will find someone else giving the same characteristics and you might loose what you gained. Overall, if you liked the Before Sunrise movies then you will like this as well. What a splendid film AT MIDDLETON is â€” a fast favorite of this picky movie lover."
8197,"Rachel Nichols is a very talented actress, very good at portraying real heartfelt emotions, and relatable vulnerability, among other things. She puts up a good fight for a bit, she even gets her on the ground and almost has her choked out, but Sabrina' taps out' asking for mercy. Whilst the teary eyed drama makes a precarious balance with the blood and guts of the fight scenes, perhaps the most impressive feature here is the sense of hopelessness which is created. Acting is generally nothing special, but then, the real drama of this situation comes not from the script, or the over-embellishment of certain of the actresses, but in the heat of the fight sequences, in the minute reactions, in the bursting of the welled up emotions and fears, and in sharing that feeling."
8199,"The sense of place and aesthetic is intelligently realised, and for all its oppressive qualities, this film is a beautiful thing to look at. She certainly deserves to be called one of the best actresses of all - time and this just confirms it further. French screenwriter, film editor and director Bruno Dumont's seventh feature film which he wrote, is based on the works and correspondences of Paul and Camille Claudel and Camille Claudel's medical records. It premiered In competition at the 63rd Berlin International Film Festival in 2013, was shot on location in real asylums in France and is a French production which was produced by producers Jean BrÃ©hat, Rachid Bouchareb and Muriel Merlin. Distinctly and precisely directed by French filmmaker Bruno Dumont, this quietly paced and somewhat biographical retelling which is narrated from multiple viewpoints though mostly from the main character's point of view, draws a literary and reflective portrayal of a woman whom after being in a relationship for fifteen years with a renowned sculptor named Auguste Rodin and spending the next ten years of her life in a self - imposed solitude, was diagnosed as schizophrenic and against her own will committed to a psychiatric hospital near Paris, France."
8210,"The photos, discovered by Maloof, display a segment of society invisible to many in the 1950s - the old, the poor, the black, the young, and the disenfranchised, a kaleidoscope of stunning images that poignantly capture the faces of humanity with humor and rare sensitivity. Writing on the website that he had about 30, 000 negatives of Maier's work that cover a period ranging from the 1950s to the 1970s, he requested direction, asking whether the photos are worthy of an exhibition or a book. Though admittedly he has a commercial interest in its promotion, Maloof has done a public service by making the world aware of the work of this great artist and has been willing to spend an enormous amount of time and money in the process. Documentaries have an interesting way of touching souls. The documentary "" Finding Vivian Maier, "" written and directed by John Maloof and Charlie Siskel, tells the fascinating tale of a woman who lived and died in obscurity - then, through a serendipitous fluke of fate and an undiscovered talent for photography, became well known and celebrated long after her death."
8249,"A mind - bending and very entertaining independent science - fiction film, Coherence takes place over a single night in which a group of old friends (an ex-lovers) gather for a party on a night when a comet is expected to pass unusually close to the Earth. Scenes propel themselves to other scenes with fast and snappy dialogue. Though it will be compared to films like Primer and Timecrimes, it's a pretty original film overall. If you're looking for aliens and spaceships this ain't it but if you like the twilight zone kinda stuff this is a good one. The film keeps you at the edge of your seat from the first frame to the last, primarily a result of the experimental production process by which director James Ward Byrkit only gave the actors notes about their goals for each scene (there was no script)."
8221,"What matters is his own face to society, to keep up appearances. The woman is rendered to an object for pleasure, for cooking, for cleaning, anything to satisfy the primary male in the family. The females have learned to accept their degradation as something normal. And under the skillful direction of Alexandros Avranas, who also co-wrote the script, as the secrets are revealed, so the tension increases."
8222,"Anchored by a superlative performance from David Gulpilil as the titular character, Charlie's Country is a beautifully realised film that explores the plight of Indigenous people living in central Australia through the experiences of a man who finds himself fed up with white fella ways yet somewhat removed from his own family, culture and community. In what is undoubtedly a match between the actor and the real man, Gulpilil inhabits this man Charlie with a grace and understanding as he struggles to come to grips with his mother country slowly but surely coming under more influence from the white man. Though there is a message and the film does make a strong political statement, it is not a one - dimensional screed but a nuanced look at the conditions Native Australians face and their struggle to retain their values in the face of white colonization. To understand the power of Charlie's Country and the telling nature of its tale, one must look into how the film eventuated and what it harboured for Gulpilil in particular. Friends for many years after their collaborations in 2002's The Tracker and 2006's Ten Canoes (Australian film's worthy of being tracked down) de Heer visited Gulpilil in jail where the seeds of Charlies Country were formed when Gulpilil expressed a great desire to once more work with his friend and director."
8228,"So great to have a movie adults can enjoy amidst a summer of cartoon plots & characters; a movie you can actually take your family to without being bombarded by violence, sex and f - bombs. Clive Owen and Juliette Binoche as artists each struggling with demons that have crippled (in Binoche's case, literally) their creative abilities, deliver wonderful performances, as does the entire cast. Owen and Binoche are pitch perfect in their roles while the supporting cast of Bruce Davison, Amy Brenneman, and well - selected teenage actors are charming, too. But their brave, deep performances and bittersweet chemistry come very close to making Words And Pictures worth a lot more than it really is. Fred Schepsi solidly directs the film and has wisely cast the central roles with actors who have enough presence and talent to make these characters more credible on the screen than from the written page."
8267,""" Horns "" is a weird and mesmerizing movie that entwines several genres. The plot is unique and anything can happen in this original story. But the other stuff with the horns and the way they make people act provides for some nice dark comedy. It combines so many different movie genres into one fun, crazy, heart felt story that unfortunately is not going to be for everyone. There are some truly hilarious and insane scenes."
8235,"The central scenario that Edgerton and Saville create is an intriguing one and a ripe potential idea and it's clear that the idea was developed first and the strands that follow afterwards and the film just can't keep up its beginning pace that sees some smart scripting and direction take place. It's pretty much a morality play, one that is very well mounted by the makers. Starting out in a hugely promising fashion, Felony looks likely to be one of those searing Australian dramas in the vein of Animal Kingdom or even Saville's own under - seen gem Noise, yet quickly descends into a procession of seen before events that culminate in a fairly unimpressive ending. A tightly wound crime drama that oozes class, this Sydney - set motion picture follows on from These Final Hours and Predestination to continue the stellar run for Australian movies in 2014."
8237,"John Wojtowicz - whose "" dramatic love story "" inspired "" Dog Day Afternoon "" starring Al Pacino - blurs the line between a man who would do anything for love and a man who would do anything for a great story to impress people with."
8245,"It had all the qualities to do so and be good. AJ Bowen is a good actor when he's doing homages to eighties horror or even playing an asshole; he doesn't have the weight needed to pull his role off. In telling the story of Jonestown, nothing would have been needed other than to have just told the story as it unfolded without the addition of this added layer of "" reality ""--and it would have been a much more superior film."
8298,"In many ways is like a 40's melodrama. Hanno Koffler and Max Riemelt are superb as the forbidden sides of this triangle. The love and passion, fear and guilt in Hanno Koffler's eyes are haunting and recognizable. There are very heartbreaking and heartwarming scenes, as well as just uncomfortable ones; it is a roller coaster of emotions. Another thing is there was also some intense and erotic scenes; the two leads have excellent chemistry together."
8321,"If you have a good pair of headphones, all the better. The sounds, staging, understated effects, locations and direction are superb. The character interactions are believable and well developed. The premise of Vatican investigators, seems a tall feet to pull off considering that the film is set in southern England, but it is pulled off brilliantly. The production team really planned these aspects very well."
8401,"A gorgeous, early - 20s gay virgin in Manhattan (if you believe there ever could be such a person), just about to graduate from Columbia and then west to Iowa for grad school, fakes a documentary film project in an attempt to meet a gorgeous gay go - go dancer he's become obsessed with online. The truly fabulous tour - of - NYC make - out scenes are celluloid - melting in a deeply romantic and convincing manner in the most egalitarian kissing yet filmed. And one of them was, and it has a lot of very sexy, erotic scenes, but it's also a pretty good story underneath."
8424,""" The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby: Her "" is great because Jessica Chastain is brilliant in portraying a woman tormented by loss. The Him and Her movies show a series of events from two different points of view, which of course is how life works. Continuing on from the frustration experienced in the saga's Him component, Her struggles to engage the audience in a meaningful way despite it featuring an assured Jessica Chastain performance and a few genuine moments of emotional power centred around loss and regret. However, there is something here that salvaged this movie; and that comes in the form of the steady Jessica Chastain with her marvel performance as the title character. James Macavoy, an actor who continues to impress, and Jessica Chastain, always amazing, play the two with diligent feeling and palpable hurt."
7131,"This animation is really enjoyable as an adult or teenager who either have never read the book or has already. The implacable fathering voice of Vittorio Matteucci certainly brings the needed authority in Virgil as Dante's guide, protector and teacher about life."
7936,"The character carries such a mystery about him that was delivered so excellently by Leonardo DiCaprio, and made it so fun to watch. All these things are delivered so well by DiCaprio. Throughout the whole film, as the relationships between all the few main characters become deeper and deeper, and the questions become answered, you just can't help but feel so into the characters' lives. Nick's bow - tie and the strange shooting style (mostly prominent early on) just made everything look cartoonish. Leonardo DiCaprio does as good a job as anyone could reasonably expect of him."
8243,"The Snakehead Lady, leader of the smugglers, gave him to a new family thus he became brothers with Stephen. Paul take Sonny to visit Ah Tai, the Tiger's leader to make peace and propose a new business of smuggling heroine inside mooncakes, which Ah Tai agrees to. Teddy succeeds but as he deliver the powder to the Tiger's base, cops storm the place. Tina makes a deal for Teddy's sake on info implicating the Dragons, enraging the gang. Paul leads the Dragons to execute Tina, in front of Sonny, with Paul giving Sonny another chance to "" find his way back home ""."
8244,"This seems to be a recurring problem with R rated comedies, you will get like two great comedies that everyone is going to compare all other comedies that follow it and this year they happen to be Neighbors and 22 Jump Street. Jake Johnson really sells the image of a guy just looking for any kind of change in his life and Damon Wayans Jr. is and actor that really puts a lot of work into whatever role he is in. All is fun in games until they cross a real life gangster and discover that being a cop is not as easy as in the movies. Good comedies are hard to do. But sometimes the cops and robbers game is fun enough that the adult wants this to become their life."
8419,"When you are above 35 you kinda look forward to seeing something that might challenge the way everything has already been presented to you repeatedly. It is very easy to relate to the problems that the older couple goes through because they are problems that most people have gone through or will go through at some point in their lives. It plays very well at first, as Jamie reveals himself to be - just like Josh - a documentarian, and one who - unlike Josh - seems to have everything work out perfectly at every step of the filmmaking process. 1) - 40 somethings getting older reaching an inflection point in their lives. What works less well is the moody semi-thriller (possibly titled Not Quite Single White Male) that Baumbach tries to graft onto his comedy about life and aging."
8184,"The film provides a valuable history lesson for those too young to remember the politics and emotions of the early days of the AIDS epidemic. Mark Ruffalo's passion jumps right out of the screen at you, and in both its most angry and its most devastating, you're right there with him. But it is the towering performance by Mark Ruffalo who manages to bring the audience into the heart of the film. She has hope and fights for change. In spite of an agonizingly long gestation period for this material (which Barbra Streisand optioned years ago, but was unable to finance), director Ryan Murphy has crafted an immediate and powerful document, alternately angry, sexy, tough, moving and thoughtful."
8246,
8102,"There were quite a few memorable scenes including the aptitude test, the fear landscapes, the simulations, the tense moments Tris and Four had that were very true to the book including the capture the flag scene, as well as the zip lining experience. If the story had been ingenious enough to justify so many conditions and unearthly circumstances, there wouldn't have been any problem. In other words, a simpleton and innocuous teenage fantasy made for female spectators; and another attempt to create the saga which will inherit the crown from The Hunger Games. For the rest, the production values are pretty high, the special effects are competent and the cast is composed in a big part by attractive multi-cultural young people who seem taken from a catalogue of Urban Outfitters (what a luck for the post - apocalyptic world). there is no acting in this kind of movies, you only need to be young and good looking, be able to learn your part and you're done."
8300,"In describing Inherent Vice, Anderson has made reference to all kinds of classic detective stories and zany comedies. Phoenix's Doc is most - definitely comparable to The Dude (Jeff Bridges) of Big Lebowski fame, but he's a far more human character than "" The other Lebowski "". Even ordering pancakes with this guy is funny. His incredible tracking shots in Boogie Nights are replaced with more subtle long takes that will sometimes follow the action, but often stay nearly - static on a conversation for minutes. Rather than blaring '70s rock tunes, the Jonny Greenwood score and licensed tracks are included in a far more subtle way."
8425,"The acting in "" Jongens "" is amazingly natural and believable. Fantastic to see a gay - themed movie without anything remotely explicit, but that still so clearly shows the enormous tension and love between the lead characters. Huge compliments to the makers for such a fantastically realistic portrayal of gay teenagers. The scenes where the two boys exchange glances, kiss, train and play together are easy to understand by anyone who has experienced young love. The film also shows Sieg's relationship with his dad, his best friend Stef and his brother Ed."
8247,"But as others have noted rushes towards the finish line (which is a good thing). But there are a few hurdles the movie has to overcome to win over the viewer. There are few good scares along the way and the mentioned ending is really good Five years later, their son Billy is the pride and joy of the family. The characters and smart and savvy in trying discern reality from imagination, or worse, supernatural occurrences."
8427,"Backcountry is a good example how one simple premise can still be thrilling with clever production and a few grisly scenes. The female character, Jenn (Missy Peregrym) was superbly realistic. That combined with Alex poking fun at Jenn's road flare, bear spray and cell phone usage provide the foreshadowing necessary for any viewers who appreciate being told where the story is headed. it's incredibly satisfying to watch because the realistic emotions touch close to home. The concept is simple, it has been done before, but Backcountry does it with smart approach by keeping the focus on the confused couple and develop their personalities."
8248,"The heart of this film does not lie in the simple plot, but in the portrayal of a woman, and her family, struggling with depression and the prospect of losing everything. Cotillard's performance is exceptional throughout, her frustration and upset so believable that it's easy to forget that this an actress playing a role. Anyone who has been affected by depression, either personally or indirectly, will find large portions of the film relatable and harrowing. After all this movie is a feast of fine acting, a reason that movies are still called art, and a spirit lifting experience that is going to linger on for a long time after you finish it. Belgian screenwriters, producers and directors Jean - Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne's ninth feature film which they co-wrote and produced, premiered In competition at the 67th Cannes International Film Festival in 2014, was screened at the 42nd Norwegian International Film Festival Haugesund in 2014, was shot on locations in Belgium and is a France - Belgium - Italy co-production which was produced by producer Denis Freyd."
8155,"Overall, if you liked Moneyball you will love this one. This is very much like Moneyball so if you liked that movie you will like this as well. Sports films typically have a love / hate relationship with viewers - most never finding that honest middle ground that satisfies everyone's wants and desires. Finally, you have Kevin Costner's greatest hits, like Bull Durham, Field of Dreams, and For the Love of the Game. But film fans hoping for a Moneyball or something smarter than Draft Day's trailers have revealed should look elsewhere."
8150,"This works to a point and it is a pretty good looking film with some particularly memorable scenes. Still, he acts on his best suspicions--or intends to act. If you were hoping for some interesting explanations about the mechanics of the ark and how all those animals were saved, you will be disappointed. Clint Mansell's music score swells thrillingly and has an epic sweep, enhancing crucial scenes and not drowning stuff out. There are some good performances, the best of which coming from Russell Crowe, who plays with real steel and a powerful charisma."
8148,"Robert Redford plays Alexander Pierce, a superior ranking Agent of S. H. I. E. L. D., friend to Nick Fury, and representative of the World Security Council. Pierce is a wonderful look into the higher ranks at S. H. I. E. L. D., contributing new insights as to how the organization is run outside of Fury, Agent Coulson, and Agent Maria Hill. Anthony Mackie is Sam Wilson aka The Falcon, an ex-military special - ops paratrooper and a welcomed addition recruited by Rogers to help fight the good fight. Sebastian Stan does an amazing job holding his own against his targets and those who get in his way of his missions. The Winter Soldier is not just a fantastic sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger and The Avengers, it should also be recognized as one of the best sequels ever made."
8250,"The found - footage genre has been on life support for a while now but this one had a cool premise in a great setting - the catacombs. All the usual plot devices and tropes that come along with the genre are here - it's just executed with finesse. You can identify with the two leads - one is the ambitious adventurer, the other is the neurotic realist. It has the chills, it has the thrills, and the added bonuses of good acting and an excellent premise. They quickly learn that the only hope of survival is to push forward deeper into catacombs,,,, furthermore they eventually discover that completing the quest of finding the philosophers stone is there only means to not only survival."
8433,"Helped by close friend Lene (Nina Kunzendorf), Nelly slowly comes back to life, but her main goal is to find her beloved husband, Johnny (Ronald Zehrfeld). Nina Hoss is lovely as the survivor, Ronald Zehofeld plays the husband, object of her obsession. Nina Hoss, who is a Petzold regular and was great in "" Barbara "", gives a career - best performance, fine - tuning the metamorphosis of the character from haggard and desperate concentration camp victim to brittle, yet strong and confident survivor. Masterly crafted by Petzold and cinematographer Hans Fromm, Phoenix is marked by stunning performances from Zehrfeld who co-starred in Petzold's last film Barbara, and by Nina Hoss whose haunting performance is unforgettable. With a superlative international cast cast, Maximilian Schell, Ingrid Thulin and Samantha Eggar - So one can see both films as it they weren't even related."
8251,"One way to achieve that is to confuse the viewer as much as the protagonists. Rich writing and solid delivery can satisfy you on several levels. It has what all great movies have - it makes you, no, it actually lets, you think about yourself, other people, and emotional situations in new and different ways. At the suggestion of their therapist (Ted Danson, in a just - right cameo) they spend a weekend at a rather large rental house, unsuspecting of the lengths their counselor is willing to go to in order to motivate them to "" connect . "" Endlessly intriguing with some superb writing and directing, and two absolutely fantastic leading performances."
8252,"The scope seems very wide but it all flows together without a hitch, and each emotional reaction keeps your eyes glued to the screen waiting for what happens next. They're your typical family, and although it may seem like they're just caricatures, they are completely convincing in their roles largely due to the realistic dialogue. The soundtrack is phenomenal too - it has an '80s thriller vibe and a lot of dark electronic grooves similar to those in You're Next but even better. It really is one of the most underrated movies of 2014 and an experience that no thriller fan should miss out on. David (Dan Stevens) arrives at the Petersons resident, claiming that he was a friend of their fallen son."
8253,"Excellent character development (especially after the first 20 minutes), which is critical for a based - on - true - life film. It's funny but very moving, with a perfect blend of "" comedy "" and seriousness (because these were dark times, both for the miners and the gay community). The dialogues are really good, well though - out, and delivered convincingly by a stellar cast, who are always believable in their roles. It's not just "" good for an indie gay movie "" - it's an incredibly powerful movie that ranks right up with the best of them this year (and with stars such as Bill Nighy and Imelda Satunton, and a probably fair budget, it doesn't have an "" amateur "" / "" indie "" feel at all either). Anyway, worth the price of admission (unlike, unfortunately, so many movies these days.)"
8254,"The two leads are excellent and have great chemistry throughout, so when the weird things start happening, you believe the husband's growing concern and the wife's pleads of innocence. The mystery itself is unraveled at a good pace as well, leaving breadcrumbs for the audience and throwing a few twists and turns along the way. And while the acting, scene direction and tension did rise to an intriguing and potentially stimulating crescendo of sorts halfway through, the expectation of climax or anticipated thematic bridge from drama / romance to horror failed to carry with it any sense of suspense. Horror films today rarely finds good performances, but this movie pleasantly has two great leads. Honeymoon still has an underwhelming revelation that fails to be scary or anything beyond that, but the film is better when the horror is much grounded, creating an intriguing symbolism within the mystery."
8438,"And also like in "" Les intouchables "" the music makes a perfect match with the story and the images. The actors listed above, along with Izia Higelin as another immigration worker, are all wonderful and interesting to watch as their characters struggle through the hand they've been dealt. Samba and Wilson steal moments of joy while living in constant fear of being discovered, while Alice is borderline depressive and insomniac. She and Samba spend much of the movie in clumsy flirtations while their stressful situations swirl around. "" Samba "" is a french comedy with a great history about the immigrants."
8255,"Upstate NY is the setting for this funny and poignant film about a set of twins who split apart but are brought together by near - death experiences. The chemistry between Wiig and Hader is incredible, and Wilson is a joy to behold. In the end there is surprisingly little meaning, other than it's good to have relatives' support in hard times. Milo's former teacher Rich is a convincing character as someone who is determined not to come out publicly as gay, and who ultimately doesn't care about Milo, despite being happy to sleep with him. The story, while dark and dreary, still manages to score some great laughs."
8440,"This "" dockumentary "" tells his story, and with it's compelling with its interviews from childhood friends, teammates, and ex-wives, as well as his inspirational counseling work after he became clean. Great interviews, a great '70s soundtrack and some good inspiration make this doc. Some terrific game footage is used, but one of the most interesting moments occurs when Brad Corbet, Jr explains how his father (former owner of Texas Rangers) had interaction with Dock Ellis the player, and later with Dock Ellis the addiction counselor. The editing and storytelling is compelling and audience often convulsed with laughter upon hearing Dock's friends recall his often absurd antics as a player and a person. He was an important and courageous player in speaking out against unfair treatment back when there was still a lot of racism in the game and to make it in the big leagues as a black man you had to be a star."
8145,"genius that made seasons 1 and 2 so special. How to tie two threads together, over such a huge jump in time, how to craft a plot that accounted for things like the season four trailer, and how to make it all feel seamless. This lanky, rubber - faced individual seems better - suited to playing the nerdy best friend than the handsome "" bad boy . """
8257,"**** Major spoilers of the ending and plot of the next movie as well! PM: In the middle of desert sir, where the working temperatures are infernal, roads and rails are blocked, and transportation costs are high. They've been there between 3 years and present day and must make it through a hefty and unexplainably moving maze to get back to where they don't remember they've come from."
8258,"Many peace activists had long suspected that the FBI was more interested in stifling legal dissent than it was in fighting crime. The raid on the FBI office was successful, and the activists took thousands of documents. Director Hamilton assumes that people watching the movie will know about Vietnam, about Cambodia, and about the FBI harassment of nonviolent activists. Shortly after the Media break - in, a larger group of antiwar activists broke into a draft board office in Camden, New Jersey, and began to destroy files. These activists--who became known as the Camden 28--fought the case in court and won!"
8259,"Rockwell is the shining light of a comic savior within the film and lifts up the depressing moments of story to a entertainingly watchable movie. Amidst all the recent movies a likable teenager character on film is kind of rare. Laggies, an affable film with quirky indie sensibilities and a great cast, explores these issues with quite a lot of charm and genuine humour, although its odd plotting fails to live up to its characters in the end. This doesn't mean that the film isn't watchable - it very much is, and will reward viewers with some truly lovely moments of wry humour and quirky characterisation along the way. The film is not exceptional, but it is enjoyable, and its performances and story progression help to elevate an average film overall."
8260,"Overall, a great movie that is hurt a little by the amazingness of Gone Girl being released the week before. As far as the thriller goes, well even less there going on honestly, there's not many scenes of suspense here to be found. Then, 2 years passes, the character grows up, and suddenly she gets a goal: she wants to understand what happened to her mother. Things change when a few years pass and Kat returns home from college. There is some very fine acting, from Eva Green as the mother, Shailene Woodley as Kat, Christopher Meloni as Kat's father and Thomas Jane as a police detective, and both writer / director Gregg Araki (from the novel by Laura Kasischke) and the cast do a very good job of capturing that confusing stage of adolescence, where one is not quite fully grown up but is certainly not at all a child anymore either."
8262,"A thoroughly entertaining, not too cerebral, romp down one box conveyor after another, the film succeeds at wrapping it's central theme of persecution and prejudice in layers of equally significant ideas: group self - identification, class ambition, dalliant obsessions, self - esteem, and self - destructive addiction. But at the same time the good guys aren't wearing the white hats. When a White Hat's daughter, Winnie (Elle Fanning), falls in with The Boxtrolls and Eggs, the town becomes the setting for a rough - and - tumble adventure as the gang attempt to find and free the Boxtrolls who have been taken by the Red Hats. Fun, funky, and full of creative freedom, The Boxtrolls delivers a meatier and more enjoyable family film than its predecessors, with a spectacular cast of voices, and some of the best animation in years. The Boxtrolls is probably going to be the least attraction for the animation genre this year, mostly because it's nearly apart from the comfort zone of today's entertainment."
8263,"Amazing performances, sharply written and wildly funny, this film will pull tears, smiles and laughs. Surprisingly, however, Levy has crafted something witty, wise and quite wonderful from Jonathan Tropper's screenplay (adapted from the latter's own best - selling novel). The seemingly talented cast seem to go through the motions, speaking contrived lines and relying on set piece comedic elements that are not funny to begin with, a rabbi called "" boner "" and Jane Fonda's fake breasts are as good as they get. The film generally seems to focus the most of Bateman's character and his relationships with others, but he carries that role well. Overall, this film is worth seeing and is a powerful yet lighthearted journey in the interplay between siblings and the event that all 30 & 40 somethings will face at some point: the loss of a parent."
8264,"Each interview is more suspenseful than the one before it, as these people who are still in power are not too happy to be answering questions about this, which none of them actually want to come to terms with what they did. It truly is unbelievable that the Indonesian government and paramilitary are still alive and well today, and are still in power, where these murderers walk free with no remorse. Adi, who wasn't born at that time, has a deep and personal commitment to not just finding answers that his whole family was asking, but to setting his country on a path of truth and reconciliation. The most fascinating interviews are those not with the killers themselves but with the children of the killers, the people who have inherited their parents' legacies (on both sides of the conflict) and now must make something of the world they share. They were spun lies about the communists and many took joy in killing them."
8448,"Just a nice action movie, manga remake such as Aeon Flux or Ultra Violet, while the style is more reminiscent of Leon or Banlieu 13 (both by Luc Besson), but without the quality of either of the latter. India Eisley does a solid job as Sawa; a character that is tough but still has enough vulnerability to make the viewer think she is in real danger much of the time. This clearly isn't Samuel L. Jackson's best film but he does a fine job as Aker. The rest of the cast are decent enough although some are clearly better than others; many of the villains are a bit too over-the-top but they never last very long. There is a twist that many viewers will probably spot in advance but thankfully it is neither too obvious nor is it too unlikely."
8265,"When it comes to true story films, there are times where film - makers try to add more or less into what really happened in the event being told. The film not only has very intense scenes of war but also very intense scenes of what can come of war. This film here could have been clichÃ©d in so many ways but thankfully a director with such masterful direction can take a familiar story like war and its impact on someone and make it feel fresh, tight and original. If you had liked The Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty and Machine Gun Preacher (not a war film but somewhat similar to Kyle's story) you will enjoy this. Were this film a wholly fictional account of a warrior with special skills put in the service of his comrades it would be quite serviceable, though no more than that."
8450,"However it is a wonderful dramedy that makes you think, laugh, and maybe even appreciate life just a little more. One of Wiig's scenes was particularly bold, but the fact that she was willing to do it shows what a good actress she is. The whole cast is brilliant really, with the obvious highlight being Kristen Wiig absolutely embodying this character to a tee. Kristin Wiig, along with the rest of this perfect cast, could not have done a better job. Some underlying dynamics and truths about BPD were spot - on, however, and Kristin Wiig was awesome as always."
8266,"(Cinephiles will notice rather direct references to many of Kev - O's other favorite movies as well, including Silence of the Lambs and Jaws.) There's suspense, and a bit of gross - out, but the film evokes more unease than outright scares, and the grotesqueries are more evocative of a nightmare after eating one too many sliders than, say, Saw. This movie has more memorable scenes than ten others together. This film is filled with these fascinating changes of tones. Thirty minutes later, the main character has some intellectual dialogues and proves that he is not as dumb as one might have thought."
8268,"With this year having a lot of movies which are getting video on demand releases, alongside a limited theatrical release, it does make you wonder what is the point of them going to theaters at all? A very smart move which leads to a pleasant end to a pleasant movie, topical on the way people hook up today and deal with the traps, pitfalls and dangers in pursuing the elusive "" no strings attached "" night of "" just sex "" with no thought for past, present or future. Analeigh Tipton is just delicious to look at and Miles Miller comes across as a thoroughly nice chap. If you get drained by the overly emotional garbage that usually accompanies American' romcom' type movies, this one will surprise you in a good way. The peripheral characters supporting the two leads are almost invisible and are barely worth mentioning."
8270,"Good action scenes, battles and some gory images, but then as it's Dracula, what do you expect. "" Dracula Untold "" (2014) is more of an action flick starring "" Dracula "" than historical story, and it's damn good one. The movie does show this in a few scenes but in a interesting if somewhat brief way. Of course, this is not the best actioneer of the year, but it's very well done one. If your looking for a movie to just sit back and have fun watching, Dracula Untold is an enjoyable romp with good actors, Charles Dance is impeccable as always and Luke Evans is good as the main character."
8271,"At times this movie reminded be a bit of "" eyes wide shut "" and "" Hanna, "" with similar colouring and locations to the movie "" cosmopolis, "" but with a much more light hearted and humorous tone. Some parts are a little mediocre, but as a whole the movie is a fun ride, and offers some good entertainment while contemplating on things like fate and taking action. Probably one of the directors best movies, if not the best. If you like wild adventure movies with comedy and action, then don't miss out on this one! It gives extra layers to this character and makes him all the more enjoyable as the lead."
8458,"He has 2 Missions to accomplish and wants to say bye to his mother and his other mother. Excellent character creation, simple but thought provoking concepts. Dramatic comedies are super hard to get right. As others have said, surprisingly good movie. The main plot is predictable, but the side - character interactions are gold (sometimes hilarious, sometimes oddly touching)."
8272,"It is not the first time a low rated movie turns out to be great, but it is certainly the greatest contrast between reviews and the actual movie. Because it doesn't fit normal expectations of narrative, and because the characters are not typical characters, first level viewers may find it a challenge - or, may find it informing their appreciation of film. It is a unique setting, one which required special measures for shooting by the film's crew, and makes the film's opening scenes promise a much richer film than what's delivered. The time frame jumps all over the place, from present day to back at the time of the abduction, then a few periods in between. The Captive's two best qualities are its snowy setting and Ryan Reynolds' lead performance."
8273,"Everything about the look of the film was perfect. Two plots â€“ one revolving around Ethan Hawke's temporal agent seeking to stop a terrorist, the other following the life of a precocious orphan who isn't quite like everybody else â€“ are intricately and intelligently woven together to not only build tension but to explore provocative themes to spoiler - y to mention here. In his second collaboration with Aussie filmmakers the Spierig Brothers, Hawke is in career - best form as the veteran time traveller on the brink of burning out, whilst relative newcomer Sarah Snook (born and bred South Australian) is outstanding in a complex and demanding role that has rightly grabbed the attention of Hollywood. The Spierig's also demonstrate their diversity in both the writing and directing departments, going from the enjoyable but tonally lightweight splatter-fest Daybreakers to this altogether more mature, thematically heavy and narratively elaborate sci - fi saga that still manages to maintain a high excitement level. Rising actress Sarah Snook with a stellar performance is backed by solid performances of both Hawke and Taylor."
8274,"The movie even had werewolves and they were also hilarious. This movie doesn't rely on just a few jokes to carry it, they maintain a subtle layer of humour throughout and then have you in stitches with some brilliant jokes. It also manages to feel effortless; there was no sense of them trying too hard for laughs - the mockumentary setting helped the film in this sense, despite the plot being thin. And while this isn't real either (obviously), it is so much more fun than anything and feels more like what good reality TV could be. The premise of vampire flatmates is absurd, but it works great, because the movie takes its characters just serious enough for the audience to be somewhat emotionally invested in them."
8276,", abusive, sickos really deserving of the title "" white trash "" - brings this film to life."
8277,"It's a beautifully simple premise for an action movie - when action movies get convoluted, they get bad i. e. John Wick gives the viewers what they want: Awesome action, stylish stunts, kinetic chaos, and a relatable hero to tie it all together. It has such a genuine sense of fun and humor, so much so that you are often laughing WITH (not AT) the movie at the preposterousness of everything and at the same time feeling genuine tension for the characters you're rooting for. To this contributes some stunning, fast - and - furious level action scenes that benefit amazingly by the practicality involved. Furthermore this is one of the few movies in which sound actually stood out and contributed in making the film a great success."
8278,"There are tons of alternatives with better script, story and acting. Camera direction is competent, there are very beautiful shots, and the few action scenes are not bad. Well the movie will win no Oscars; but it was entertaining cute! The four "" Robin Hood "" - like youngsters, who enjoy being crooks besides their student life, are Sam (Ed Speleers), Fordy (Will Poulter), Yatesey (Alfie Allen) and Rafa (Dabastian De Souza). Alfie Allen who plays Yatesey is a bright spot."
8279,"Yes, it's too long and yes, director David Dobkin needs to work on his tone and pacing, but the story is great and the performances are fantastic! If you are a true film lover who revels in watching great actors practice their craft, you will not be disappointed by The Judge. This movie is definitely worth sitting through for amazing performances by both Downey and Duvall, who could both be up for Oscar nominations for their roles as the son and father, respectively. There are many very funny moments as well as many touching moments between father and son, brother and brother. Plus, Robert Downey Jr. is excellent in this film; he steels every scene he's in and that's pretty the whole movie."
8280,"It is a film about how people live, love, talk, help each other out, appreciate each other and sometimes work on each other's nerves. Some scenes are funny in an understated way, and make you softly chuckle in your seat. The director does a perfect job in balancing the emotions. Some scenes are very elongated and show little action, which gives an intense effect in combination with the wonderful and very prominent soundtrack consisting of piano pieces by Chopin. The book - stealing should've been thrown out or changed to something believable, they shouldn't have had so many scenes of Ben being annoying to his family, they should've either got rid of Vlad or made him more realistic, they should've at least told what happened to Ben and they should've ended it before the godawful stairwell crying scene."
8281,"Fury is a gritty film, with great productions values, really period vehicles, settings and costume. Watch LaBoeuf's nervous leg, and a list of other endearing nuanced details; He plays a very convincing religious proselytizer. Besides doing it the right way destroys the tank in fifteen minutes and turns a heroic stand into the suicidal idiotic idea it is in the last month of the war."
8282,"Mads Mikkelsen has proved himself worthy of leading roles even in (his not native tongue) English. The visual style is superb, and director Levring uses every trick in the book. Mads Mikkelsen is excellent as a hardworking taciturn Danish immigrant who's spent years trying to make a living in this land of opportunity. Action scenes are realistic and very well done, and there's some pretty good cinematography throughout. Director Kristian Levring brings to fruition the Western life experience in a fashion that keeps you intrigued and hopeful of a sequel or certainly another film just as brilliant, if not better."
8283,"Although Naomi Watts' Russian hooker is a bit over the top in beauty and heart of gold categories, she manages to project a simple love for Vincent, a symbol for everyone who loves Vincent even as rough as he is. St. Vincent is an entertaining film with a well - worn message, but Bill Murray, in his finest role since Lost in Translation, transforms it into holiness. But the deeper story is that family is really the friends you choose and the wide cast of misfits are brought together by a mix of circumstances and events. A real good feel movie that shows how saints are everywhere, everyday, check out St. Vincent. So his portrayal in St. Vincent may not be much of a stretch for the actor, but it is wildly captivating performance that needs to been seen."
8284,"And yet, The Rewrite surprises rather than annoys, revealing a newfound and very welcome maturity in both director and star. Oscar - winning screenwriter Keith Michaels (Grant) is down in the dumps: he can't get a job in Hollywood anymore, and he's been estranged from his family for years. But, as the term progresses, he begins to find inspiration in his students, ranging from a Star Wars nut through to a writing prodigy, but most importantly, optimistic single mom Holly (Marisa Tomei). Arrogant, formerly famous writer brought to his knees and taught the value of humility, feminism and love. As it turns out, it's pretty safe to make all of these assumptions: The Rewrite doesn't re-invent the romantic comedy, nor does it fling any huge surprises at the audience."
8285,The 2016 prequel is leaps and bounds better than this movie.
8471,"Sure, against the great films of the last century this doesn't need to be mentioned, but against light, comedic summer flicks, it is absolutely palatable. Meanwhile, a playwright named Joshua (Will Forte) begins to fall in love with Isabella, despite dating Jane Claremont (Jennifer Aniston), a bitter and hot - tempered therapist. Peter Bogdanovich's' She's Funny That Way' is an entertaining, enjoyable film, thats amongst the best Screwball comedies in recent times. She's Funny That Way packs a lot of manic energy in its eighty minutes, including great displays of character acting and plenty of nods to film lovers. Peter Bogdanovich's She's Funny That Way is exactly the kind of film that isn't made any more; a manic, silly comedy helmed by an ensemble cast made for adults."
8286,"Nightcrawler works on so many levels. The writing and direction is fantastic, which is especially impressive as it's the directorial debut by Dan Gilroy who takes on both duties. The acting is phenomenal - Gyllenhaal gives a performance that's the polar opposite from his character in Prisoners and he was on point for every second. Nightcrawler throws you right into the gritty streets along with a hustling thief, Lou, who starts freelancing as a videographer of crime scenes and selling his footage to a news channel for money. Lou's persistence and crass remarks to basically anyone he encounters provide some good laughs."
8287,"While the film is somewhat similar to Pixar's The Incredibules due the film's plot dealing with robots and and children with superpowers, it is very enjoyable and would easy please children as well as parents. Baymax is so cute, and the other character's have a kind of Asian feel to them. If you love Marvel movies, you will most definitely like this one as well. If you are more akin to beautiful landscapes and animated design, then by all means, this is the movie you will want to watch. baymax is the true highlight of the film, but hiro and tadashi are incredibly stong and great characters."
8166,"After the slew of assaults upon his person, they climax by confronting him, causing him to have a nervous breakdown, and they literally stand around watching as he breaks his nose and then trips into a glass pane that shatters and cuts him up."
8289,"For those thinkers out there who enjoy time travel movies - you'll end up pretty frustrated. As the film is set in one location it really requires strong performances from the cast and thankfully all three leads excellent as are all the supporting cast. Time Lapse is 104 minutes of suspenseful and thrilling entertainment. Until the moron putting the bets on clearly puts huge bets on with a single bookmaker, and wins constantly, leading his bookmaker to come round to the house and."
8475,"The scenes from the past are capable of producing great nostalgia, while those set in Wilson's "" older years "" tell a compelling story that many may not know. It's these moments that show the film was made by fans with an attention for detail. Seeing Wilson's unorthodox recording techniques is such a pleasure for music nerds. In biopic terms, the 60's segments are probably the more gripping, providing a riveting insight into the production techniques of the iconic "" Pet Sounds "" album, frequently cited as one of the most innovative and creative albums ever released. Director Bill Pohlad does a marvelous job of illustrating the parallels between each on screen version of Brian Wilson, and both actors give brilliant, emotional performances."
8200,"John Cusack is also well cast as Stafford Weiss, the self - help charlatan father of Benjie who is made very creepy by Cusack's dark, dead eyes and blank expression. MAPS TO THE STARS is very much an' auteur' movie, highly intelligent and stylized, but perhaps perched uncomfortably between satire and psychodrama. Mia Wasikowska is great as well as Moore's hanger on and personal assistant who unravels and goes off the deep end and beyond. As "" Havana Segrand, "" an actress dying for a big comeback, Moore illustrates her most vibrant and fruitful interpretation since "" Cathy Whitaker "" in Far from Heaven. Everything seemed to finally click for actress Mia Wasikowska in her most daring performance to date."
8163,"An excellent script can make you buy into even the most ridiculous of plots, but first - time - writer Jack Paglen's script never finds a constant tone, is unevenly paced, has underdeveloped side plots, and keeps you at arm's length from any connection with the characters and the story. Pfister's direction is expedient, and he avoids the jumpy camera syndrome that typically plagues these kinds of movies. An airtight script that rises up to the challenge was all that was needed to make Transcendence truly, um, transcendent. It's about "" go terrorists, go, if you think that you are doing good thing it's all good! "" While its cons might be the lack of characters development this doesn't change the fact that the story line and concept is better than a lot of other movies and it is presented well."
8293,"Three cheers to all the other actors who made this film great. Never comfortable to watch, this gem as a story and as a vehicle for incredible performances is not to be missed. This is a very relevant film for providing both a broader view of what clinical depression can look like and the varying life outcomes depending on choices made of how to handle the condition. And it is precisely this complementary distribution in their philosophies of life (as characters) and performances (as actors) that makes this truly one of the most amazing films. There are a large number of great actors and actresses giving excellent performances, which provide this drama with a vastness going beyond the usual character development."
8294,"In Bennett Miller's dark and ominous Foxcatcher, the episode is framed as a true - life Faustian Tale. As du Pont, Carell is almost unrecognizable beneath make - up and prosthetics. As a past Academy Award nominee, Mark Ruffalo's exceptional portrayal of the older Schultz comes as less of a surprise. The normally wiry Ruffalo packed on a lot of muscle to play Dave Schultz. All three performances are a study in the art of subtly."
8144,"This is one of those movies that is touched by the magic of the movies--maybe not enough to make it great or even good as a movie, but it has a relentless sparkle - eyed charm that makes it pleasant and irrationally satisfying as an experience. The actress Evan Rachel wood looks stunning natural beauty with natural emotions and a very lovable level of innocence, the story is different from usual boy meets girl romantic genre, movie is edgy with some cute lines, handling the issue of home locked person with a scizopernic mother beautifully, the actor looks smart and has acted well, this is a movie id love to watch some other time too. But it also means you feel things on a different level, you probably enjoy things more than others, since you are more connected to things and letting them in. Scott Speedman is just great as the scatterbrained lead Jay, always looking over his shoulder, and running for the next bit of scraps as his life is slowly rotting away under him. The colors are warm and the tempo is upbeat but slows down for some nicely done heart - to - heart scenes."
8111,"Like the' Underworlds', this is the creation of Kevin Grevioux, the hulking gravel voice actor who proves that brains and brawn can co - exist. That's especially true now, during awards season, when the cinemas are otherwise crowded with Important Movies that might be worthy but difficult to watch. It is also effective when it comes to action scenes especially the flying of Gargoyles and the bursting of the demons. In the span of what feels like five minutes, the film tells Frankenstein's backstory, introduces the demons and gargoyles, explains their ongoing war, shows a training montage of Frankenstein learning to use the gargoyle's weapons, and suddenly cuts from the 18th century to present day. Caught between the two sides, he gets more and more peesed off until he hooks up with Terra and prevents his creator's journal from being used to bring about the Demon - clypse."
8295,""" Stonehearst Asylum "" is an insane, Gothic thriller with a lot of chills, thrills, and fun to be had along the way. In general an entertaining film about lunatics and an asylum, set in a Gothic era, the cast really do bring a lot to this film. 6/5 stars If you like period pieces, psychopathic characters, excellent actors, and plenty of atmospherics, then "" Stonehearst Asylum "" should be right up your alley. If you love unique films with plot twists, you'll like "" Stonehearst Asylum! "" Stonehearst Asylum is an excellent movie."
8296,"The movie is hilarious & showcases dramatic personality conflicts in the dating world and outside the best friend relationship. So far, that's just how the story goes, their lives somehow co-dependent with each other until one of them fell in love, for real and started to lose time with her bestie. Overall, it's a light, sweet and mildly funny life stories of late twenty - somethings. It's a heart - warming, feel - good and very real kind of movie that you will enjoy watching even when you are alone, with your partner or with your closest buds. All six stars go to the performances of the leads."
8297,"The acting is actually pretty good, and there are even some very interesting characters that you can tell are having good fun with their parts. Shane Johnson did a solid job as the titular character, whoever played the wife did a great job although her scenes were obviously limited, the little girl was very good. But quite the contrary, the main character acting is believable, visual effects though scarce are well made and add to the scariness of some scenes, and it's overall a refreshing horror flick that makes good use (but doesn't abuse) of the "" found footage "" format that is so popular in horror movies these days. There are even instances where the camera appears to defy the action in the scene, such as remaining perfectly still while a crash has apparently happened. Your adrenaline rushes, your heart pounds, your ears ring, and you exhibit all of the symptoms of "" being afraid "" without actually having a reason to be afraid."
8113,"Much better than Breakfast of Champions, and more mature than a Hunter S. Thompson romp, though with all of the paranoia. Two, the performances by both Sam and Olivia were convincing and enjoyable, especially Sam. The illicit affair instills a newfound confidence in Doug, and much like Kevin Spacey in American Beauty, he begins to rebel against everything and everyone that has been holding him back all these years. Consider Rockwell in Moon, or Monaghan in True Detective, two very strong performances. There are a few other side plots, including an ill - conceived murder plot and a surprisingly sweet moment that finds Doug bonding with his troubled, distant 12 - year - old son, but the crux of this film is Doug's transformation from put - upon loser to swaggering, cocky bad boy."
8117,"In bringing together elements from Inglourious Basterds, Ocean's Eleven and Museum Hours, George Clooney certainly had plenty of opportunity for a rich and interesting story. War heroes who appreciate fine art played by the likes of Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray and John Goodman (plus a few "" that guy "" s), attempting to steal back priceless works of art from the Nazis, it sounds amazing. It's amazingly obvious that in neither of these capacities does Clooney know what he is doing. The truth is, The Monuments Men could be, and really should be much more entertaining than it is. "" The Monuments Men "" is a group of men (in real life around 350, and in this film 7) who are tasked with saving the historically and culturally significant monuments, fine arts and archives during World War II."
8603,"There is a lot going on and a lot of layers to the plot. The first few scenes were quite good, obviously imitating the cool atmosphere of films by Tarantino and Rodriguez. Seeing JCVD do his "" actual acting "" thing is also fairly enjoyable. OK, you get the idea of the attempt JCVD is making to engage in deeper and more exciting roles than those shown so far. The good: The cinematography is really nice (except for a view hiccups)."
8181,"Jon Favearu has a lot of friends. Special mention must be made of Emjay Anthony, who plays Favreau's son Percy with the perfect blend of maturity and innocence, and is really the emotional centre of the film. There is also a lot of enjoyment to be had from watching the performances of the supporting cast, and perhaps this is because each of them play to their strengths: Robert Downey Jr steals the scene as Casper's ex-wife's other ex-husband who is rich, generous, and always looks like he's on the verge of doing something really crazy; Sofia Vegara plays Casper's sweet, sexy, well - meaning ex-wife, who he is still great friends with; John Leguizamo, always an interesting actor to watch, has fantastic chemistry with Favreau and the young actor who plays his son, and some of the more meandering scenes in the film are made interesting by his infectious energy; and Dustin Hoffman adds an element of compassion to a role that could have easily been reduced to a caricature. Favreau directs and stars as Carl Casper, a celebrated chef at a swanky Los Angeles restaurant, whose creativity and integrity is compromised by the restaurant's controlling owner. More than this, he gets involved in a spat with the town's number 1 food critic, sees his relationship with his son founder under pressure of work and still pines after his glamorous and super-rich ex-wife."
8301,"Likewise, the final chapter in the series (Mockingjay: Part 2) will likely suffer from having to do without all the dramatic build - up that Part 1 offers. This felt very much like they were stretching it out so they could make two movies - which is the new thing to do in Hollywood with these franchises. It's a fitting continuation of Katniss' journey, but - and that is the one serious downside to this film - it doesn't lead that journey to its logical conclusion. The only good aspect of this movie is the interesting game with politics between president Snow who tries to scare everyone and prevent them from joining the rebels using Peeta and president Coin who tries to rouse everyone to fight using the Mockingjay, Katniss; all of this propaganda using the media. But the most impressive aspect about' Mockingjay: Part 1' is how layered it actually is."
8302,"The rest of the cast is really good as well, especially Lorrenza Izzo as Pilar, Retta as bar owner / landlord Sydney, Matt Walsh as the school administrator Washout and young Isaac White as Leon. The kids were great, Hayley Joel Osmant was great, the supporting adults were great, just a great movie. The black lady was absolutely hilarious, would really love to so more movies starring her. (Try It) Best Part: Haley Joel Osment shines. If you take this movie for what it is--a low - key, low budget comedy with some points to make--it's a nice way to spend 90 minutes."
8303,"While the performances were good, the casting was way off. Other than spectacular visuals and 3 - D, they don't seem to care enough about anything else. But there is everything missing in Exodus that made Gladiator a hit. You are going to enjoy watching the magnificent sequence of millions of frog jumping in ancient buildings. A fake epic devoid of any real emotions and soul."
8143,"Despite its paper - thin plot and many, many failed attempts at humor, Need for Speed still works thanks to the generous amount of high - octane action sequences, and the undeniable charisma of Aaron Paul. With less than two days to get from New York to California before the race begins, Tobey embarks on a cross-country trek that features plenty of jaw - dropping moments, made even more thrilling by director Scott Waugh's insistence that all driving stunts be performed by real drivers in real cars. If you like fast and beautiful cars, this is for you. This adds an extra layer of tension that's sorely missing from the Fast and Furious series (to which Need for Speed is destined to be compared), and the film's best moments come courtesy of E-brake drifts, squealing tires, and near collisions. While some adaptations have come close to getting it right (Silent Hill is probably the best), most video games movies have been absolutely terrible, with Super Mario Bros. and Street Fighter: The Movie serving as a shining example of what not to do."
8305,"20 years later, you plan a reunion and bring better pizza, a cooler filled with beer and invite everyone to the same place again."
8306,"Watch it only without prejudice, and you will enjoy Katie Holmes acting, and Miss Meadows' clothing and hairstyles. Forget for a minute you're watching Tom Cruise's ex wife, forget that she's also a co-producer, and just let yourself enjoy the movie. Miss Meadows' clothes, combined with her hairstyles and maybe the makeup, are the things that make this movie so enjoyable. Scenography is also nice, but Katie Holmes in a elegant high waist skirt wearing white gloves and tap - dancing shoes, with cute hair strands and big eyes, this is something completely overwhelmingly cute and sure a reason to love at least a little the film. Katie Holmes carries the film single - handedly as the drop dead gorgeous heroine who cleans up the neighborhood & manages to win the hearts of adversaries, children, & most importantly, the audience."
8500,"Brice and Duplass are able to funnel the mumblecore's priority of character development and use of a more natural dialogue, or in this case, a very naturally unnerving dialogue, into the staples of a Jason Blum (Paranormal Activity) produced horror film. Creep is a disturbing nightmare of a film that takes twists that may feel familiar, but remains creative and is a refreshing take on the found footage genre. Cash - strapped videographer Aaron (played by the film's director Patrick Brice) is offered $1000 for a day of filming, discretion appreciated. Another thing this movie does very well, it manages to maintain its mysterious and surreal feel, but at the same time actually delivers laughs. That last sentence pretty much captures the film experience as you go back and forth from shocking jump scares and very unsettling interactions between the vulnerable Aaron and the assertively goofy Josef."
8307,"There are plenty of other black films out there that really entertain and sometimes make a point about race perceptions and relations. Seriously, people need to check themselves and get backbones for calling this funny, smart, or witty. Well funded and full of passion, it simply shows whites as the worst people, ever. Instead of putting up a highly - specialized / strawman definition, only to pretend that it's THE definition."
8501,"If you like romantic comedies with ridiculous antics, this film will have you smiling and laughing in no time. It's definitely has its laugh out loud moments. The movie was well acted all the way around, with plenty of people you'll recognize from some of your favorite shows. It's was an enjoyable waste of 90 minutes. To say its a good comedy, probably the answer is yes, Actors are funny and good, the plot is a bit clichÃ© but still it is pretty enjoyable."
8502,"Writers Jon Wright and Mark Stay borrow elements from classic film and TV science fiction shows, Matrix and Terminator - like flying machines, giant century robots, Borg space cubes and Stars Wars droid restraints to name a few. an intelligent and powerful bunch of robots made a transmitter than can get deactivated just by electricity. The hero is a young teen boy and his friends who, inexplicably, take on an invading army of robots who conquered the armies of earth in short order. Quite happy with the world domination theme set somewhere in the future with mind control and Techno robots but also the great use of Tec, mixed in with Northern Ireland & Isle of Man. While not as thought provoking as the recent The Machine, as fun as Attack the Block or as good as World's End, it is nicely put together and worth viewing for fans of old school British scifi who may get a restraining jolt buzz from this production."
8308,"His groundbreaking work' A brief History of Time' and devastating disabilities propelled him irrevocably into the public consciousness and immortal fame. He starts out as a shy, somewhat bookish and nerdy student who has a fair bit of humour to him and also has a love of education and finding out the big questions and answers of the world. Her performance is an emotional one and is beautifully and brilliantly portrayed as well and is also one of the year's best performances. The film has an excellent pace to it and works well as a biographical film, but works even better as a story of love and the difficulties and sacrifices it took to make it work and just how strong both Stephen and his wife are at the end of this film after all they have gone through. The Theory of Everything, is a real triumph and one of the best films of 2014."
8118,""" The Lego Movie "" was an awesome, super creative, and extremely satisfying film for all ages - that is, if you have ever played with Legos. Full of surprises, The Lego Movie won't let You see what's coming. Obvious kid favorites will include perma - smiled Unikitty (Alison Brie) and zany 80's throwback astronaut Benny (Charlie Day) whose ability to create spaceships is frustratingly overlooked. Yet within The Lego Movie's brick - blocked world, everything including the story feels incredibly new and original. The characters are all funny and likable with enough personality to them to fill up multiple movies on their own."
8309,"It gets genuinely disturbing and hard to watch at times, but what draws you into it in the first place and what really makes you * believe * is the performances. Alex Essoe is absolutely terrifying as Sarah. This is a testament to everything working in harmony: the filmmakers' vision, the actors' devotion to the roles, the eerie retro electronic score, the bleak cinematography. If you like Lynch-esque movies that make you think but also make you feel unnerved then you'll definitely get some chills and thrills from Starry Eyes. Since it's still on Netflix, everyone who enjoys horror movies should take the time to watch Starry Eyes."
8141,"Mr. Peabody (voiced by Ty Burrell) is the brainiest dog in all the land, and a celebrated inventor, athlete and businessman to boot. Everything goes well until the bespectacled Sherman (Max Charles) starts school. Forced to play nice with Penny (Ariel Winter), a classmate who ridicules him for having a dog as a father, Sherman shows her the WABAC: a time machine invented by Mr. Peabody to allow his son to bear witness to history in the making. Most of these references will likely be lost on younger viewers, but there's still plenty to keep them entertained. As the film races along in its madcap way, gags and puns (so bad they're brilliant) are tossed at the audience in such great amounts that it's rather amazing that most of them work as well as they do."
8310,"The other IMDb reviewer who said this could be the best animated feature ever made may not be wrong. The only real comparison that's able to be drawn is to the work of Hayao Miyazaki, simply because there's not another animated filmmaker out there who's as honest and earnest with their culture's folklore to compare to. When a studio with such a good first effort under their belt takes five years to come out with a second film, you can bet that it's because they're doing something magical. This is because selkies are in touch with nature, love and the ancient way of things. However, this is no ordinary animation: It swirls with pastels that morph into imaginative lines capturing humans and faeries as if the world supported both in their glory and despair--a phantasmagoric hot mess if you will."
8588,"Beside it's funny and tasty as Cem YÄ±lmaz's finest work: Her sey cok guzel olacak, it's also good to see a lot of references to some Turkish movies. It also shows the wide range of Cem Yilmaz's acting skills, and the movie is full of surprising guest stars in addition to the main characters, each and every one of whom deserve major applause for their parts. Those who need to sort movies into various categories, who see drama as a baddies versus goodies game, who think heroes are only deadly serious supermen on a mission to save the world, those who think that digital effects can substitute the absence of creative imagination and that improvisation and clowning around pertain only to stand - up comedies. Cem YÄ±lmaz' and Ozan GÃ¼ven's splendid acting performances make these characters natural and convincing, and create them with an engaging self - irony, far from any showy pathetic effects. It is funny, gives messages, includes many topics, has some references to a few popular Hollywood movies such as Avatar, Fight Club, Oceans 11."
8557,"Well developed plot and some thought - provoking issue resolutions. The direction is spot on from Wade Gasque and the camera work is mostly very good but the scenes that are beautifully framed and shot are let down by wobbly camera action in some of the dialogue scenes â€“ seriously if it looks good and works then stick with it. Mark Strano is Chet, who stayed in the family home, and even runs the family hardware store. The flashback scenes of Todd and his brother Chet also have moments that work--good casting, here, too, as these young actors work well together. Marc Strano at the helm of a film he costars in has done good work with Tiger Orange."
8311,"Bythewood made an impact in 2000 with her feature film debut, Love & Basketball and she followed the success of that movie with The Secret Life of Bees. Just a note for the viewers: there are a number of highly provocative and suggestive dance routines, from the first scenes onward, which have sexual connotations, plus one or two actual sex scenes in the film which are not explicit. There were some parts of the movie that made you smile and cheer and then the note so happy moments - all the emotions needed when viewing a great movie. Not really an Oscar movie but good solid directing and screenplay and really great acting performances particularly from Driver, Gugu Mbatha - Raw, and (the extremely handsome and delicious) Nate Parker. After seeing Gugu Mbatha - Raw's performance in "" Belle "" recently and now viewing her rather dazzling screen charisma here, she would certainly seem to be a rising star."
8201,Plenty of good laughs to be found in this film.
8313,"Whereas Assange can impress people as narcissistic and Bradley / Chelsea Manning's sexual confusion was only one of a number of facets which distracted from Cablegate, Snowden sounds like a young Ellsberg â€“ very intelligent and well - spoken. Through all of the discussion of his methods and the nature of the material he revealed, Snowden presents his case in an eloquent manner, remaining calm and centered, saying that he anticipated the consequences and is prepared for them. "" Citizenfour "" hits all the marks of a good documentary: it is topical, relevant, well organized and thought provoking. In January 2013, Snowden contacted documentarian Laura Poitras via an anonymous email name "" Citizenfour "". Ms. Poitras structures the film as a thriller, and it will certainly cause tension in every viewer."
8512,"But Mena Suvari is absolutely gorgeous (if that's not a too non-PC thing to say) and is one of the best things about this movie! Not quite a feel - good movie, not quite a rom - com and not quite a, er, well, anything else, really. Nothing to remember for the ages, but, fine. Another pleasant surprise in this film: When conversation became more serious (between Vince and Jane), the actors and lines were believable and not corny or clique like so many male - female love stories. The scenes where he is hanging out with his male friends are hilarious - all his friends are funny!"
8314,"Reprising their roles as Nick (Jason Bateman) the straight man, Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) the womanizer, and Dale (Charlie Day) the fool, the three stars of this film bounce lines off one another like bumper cars to increasingly hilarious effect. There were so many funny moments from the best characters in Horrible Bosses plus the welcome addition of Chris Pine and Christopher Waltz. If you are looking at the line - up for the weekend and just want something everyone will enjoy, check out Horrible Bosses 2. 1 star for Jennifer Aniston 1 star for Kevin Spacey A comedy should be funny. Jennifer Aniston also returns as her sex - addicted dentist from the first film and gets to appear in the funniest scene of Horrible Bosses 2."
8139,"Angry and despondent, Donna unleashes her frustration onstage, crashing and burning in front of the audience before finding solace in genuine nice guy Max (Jake Lacy), with whom she shares a few drinks - and a bed. Obvious Child delivered 84 minutes of witty dialogue, excellent performance (Jenny Slate) and humor mixed with light drama. Comedically it's on par with a lot of straight up comedies, but it separates itself by having true moments of drama."
8123,"These two "" Dudes "" are so great at being friends, Mike, and Matty; Mike really wants things to stay the same no matter how much they change, and Matty is so willing to walk through anything to be there for his best friend. Humor, Drama and every flavors in the movie are well balance so it is really an interesting movie to watch. This movie was filmed a few years ago, but the story, and sentiment are still very relevant. It is about friendship more than anything else and that is why it works. Megan Mullally has a small but perfectly formed part as Mattys mom and the clichÃ©s are kept mostly at arms length."
8315,"It is extremely entertaining to watch the action scenes unfold and the humor is top - notch. However, this movie packs some fun dialogs and good laughs (for the first half of the movie) and is also a good family fun. There are big laughs and funny throughout. His inventions strange but very interesting: D Scientist's language very funny. They managed to sneak in touching moments too."
8316,"The charming Olga Kurylenko is good as the attractive widow mistreated by his brother - in - law who wants to marry her. It displays a colorful and evocative cinematography by Oscar - winning cameraman Andrew Lesnie, being his final movie. Sensitive as well as thrilling musical score by David Hirschfelder, helped by Lisa Gerard. His successful military campaigns led to liberation of the country and to the establishing of Turkey. He transformed the former Ottoman Empire into a democratic, modern, secular nation - state, his reforms are referred as Kemalism."
8202,"they have each other's backs and are best buds but going back to college shows each of them a new direction and their friendship is severely tested in this world of frat parties, pledging and that oh so American Institution. The good thing about this flick is, that it doesn't take itself too seriously while at the same time delivering a good and fast paced story with quite some surprises and good action. Like the first one, 22 Jump Street does a great job observing the different aspects of college life, students and teachers (or professors for that matter). If you like that type of comedy, this one is for you, as it delivers on point and, without a doubt, is the funniest flick this year so far! It's really about getting a good balance in your movies types and picking the right one for your current mood."
8318,"The voices is a very dark comedy; there were parts which were completely laugh out loud funny (eg: many of mister whiskers' lines) and other parts were tragically serious. It's a pretty sick story, made sicker by how colorful the whole film is. The joy in Reynolds' eyes when he is shown human kindness by other co - workers (Gemma Arterton & Anna Kendrick) is as key to this performance as the insanity that other actors would have focused on and turned into scenery chewing. This was very entertaining once everything began to unfold. The Voices is a brilliant film about schizophrenia that balances horror and comedy with such aplomb you forget that what's happening on the screen isn't exactly healthy or good."
8521,"Richard is also a womanizer, indulging in relationships with many of his beautiful undergraduate students that admire him for his aged beauty and intellect. Despite this relationship, Richard has always found Kate's sister Olivia (Salma Hayek) incredibly gorgeous as well, and finally gets his chance to win her over when Kate asks for a divorce upon meeting someone from her work that loves and cares about her more than he does. Richard (Brosnan) is a college professor who teaches the classics and has a young and beautiful wife. This is a zany, screwball comedy at its core, the kind that has gone by the wayside in favor of more romantic, if incredulous, displays of romance and over-the-top comedy, despite lacking half the comedic talent and screen writing craziness. This is anything but a cheery, feel - good romantic - comedy."
8319,But after Kev sends Bubbles a letter to go to Minneapolis the boys arrive with Ricky under the impression Minneapolis is at the North Pole thanks to Bubbles wanting to keep the Christmas Spirit. The sharper new Netflix TPB looks slick and plays homage to both the series and Christmas Special. Longer than the standard TPB special it is a spectacular every seconds. Everyone deserves a couple drinks at Christmas.
8320,"A nice, although dark thematically, thriller about a CIA veteran agent who has the opportunity to settle his differences with a long time enemy. Some better than others of course, but he always seems to carry the movie no matter how badly written or executed."
8179,"After the first act (when there was actually still some real acting required from the actors), there are virtually no interesting moments anymore when the human protagonists interact, let alone lingering scenes where the characters get to talk long enough to one another to even try to build such a thing as chemistry. Scenario 1: If you are going to see this film because you really enjoy classic Godzilla movies and you hope the music and campy theme of those films are represented in this one, you absolutely should go see it. Unlike in' Jaws', there are no interesting human characters here who could help create the kind of tension - heavy atmosphere or sense of impending doom the way Chief Brody, Hooper and Quint could 40 years ago. The young director (' Monsters') has stated many times that' Jaws' was a huge inspiration for him on this movie, and it is hardly a coincidence that the (human) hero in' Godzilla' shares the same name with the hero in Spielberg's masterpiece (they're both called Brody). The atmosphere of mystery and dread is tangible; the human element is there, the acting and the dialogues are solid, and the production design is breathtaking (especially the apocalyptic images of an evacuated city in Japan which was left to decay for 15 years, overgrown with plants and with packs of wild dogs running in the streets)."
8322,"This film had a good storyline, locations used gave the film a very convincing feel. Harvey Keitel does his best, but he must have known this was going to be a Krimbo turkey from day one. Downbeat locations and realistic dialogue seem to add a feeling of doom for the Mafia lifestyle that is portrayed as dying out. In the sidebars, Nick's' driver' is the fat but fearless George Mullins (Slaine) who makes Nick's initial difficult kill for him, Nick's real father (Paul Ben - Victor) and younger brother Vito (an impressive turn for Kenny Wormald), a love affair with Ali Matazano (Leighton Meester), and various conflicts with Salvatore's enemies. The acting was also very good from top to bottom, and the action scenes were well directed and very well executed."
8324,"The pursuit of truth for reporters is not easy, nor has the well - known adage of killing the messenger abated in the least. Stylized heavily with its colors and the other external footage it uses, the film gives off an aged and exciting feel, similar to other movies from past decades."
8162,"The bird formations, their beautiful feats have been all been seen in RIO and there is nothing new to offer on that front too in RIO 2. The other aspects were fine, considering this is a commercial animated film. While maintaining a pedigree for celebrating song and dance through a kaleidoscopic burst of colors, Rio 2 is gorgeously rendered but offset by a clichÃ©d script that is also laced with classroom lecture. Speaking of which, lookout for a hilarious scene aimed at adults where Nigel and Gabi find themselves dramatizing one of Shakespeare's greatest plays. While many such segments are genuinely funny, the story strays at times with subplots from deforestation to male bonding, before stepping into a puddle of teary - eyed melodrama."
8326,"At least the' funny' scenes in the Lord of the Rings trilogy were subtle and less in number; BOTFA was supposed to be "" serious and dark "" and those silly, ridiculous scenes pretty much ruined that. It's not their fault that their character development was rushed because the movie was full of pointless Legolas Vs. Gravity scenes, dull Tauriel scenes who fell in love with Kili after having a conversation with him once or twice - same goes for Kili who fell in love with her and even gave her the token his mother, DÃ­s, gave him. If the unnecessary Dol Guldur scenes and the Tauriel storyline were skipped, every good part from the book which is now cut out would have easily fit in. Why did Jackson have to create Tauriel, the female ninja - elf and her love - story with a DWARF? - The incredible length of the scenes."
8327,"Indeed, the most compelling scenes in the film appear to be those involving Johnson's political machinations. "" In DuVernay's best scene, LBJ finally "" comes around "" and tells off George Wallace face to face. DuVernay is more successful when she sticks to straightforward historical events. DuVernay paraphrased King's speeches, but little of it sounds spoken by the great man! Martin Luther King educates the nation on how after the emancipation, the Southern aristocracy was afraid of the freed slaves organizing with the poor whites for better working conditions, so they passed the Jim Crow segregation laws to separate them."
8328,"The performances throughout the cast was good, Angelina Jolie got the what she needed from the cast to tell this story in this particular way. It's very easy to watch with its amazing array of beautiful colors and shots. "" Unbroken "" is based on the excellent award - winning inspirational book (2010) by Laura Hillebrand, who has an eye for detail and description. It is a biography of the exciting life of Louis Silvie Zamperini of Torrance, California. This movie does little beyond telling the story of Louis Zamperini - and it does so with a lot of missing details, no character growth, and contains little else than drawn out scenes of suffering."
8329,"Ana Lily Amirpour presents the first ever Iranian romantic vampire thriller that blends the styles of Spaghetti Westerns, graphic novels and 1950's rebel flicks, while making a social statement regarding Muslim women. This festival favorite is an expanded version of Ms. Amirpour's 2011 short film of the same title, and the use of black and white, combined with cinematographer Lyle Vincent's extraordinary photography, delivers a beautifully stark dream - like atmosphere that lends itself well to the sparse dialogue approach. On the other hand, it has a very nice atmosphere and some of its aspects, like the music or the bleak black and white, give it an atmosphere close to a Western. There are a couple of scenes really good. The vampire's movements are hilarious (not sure if on purpose)."
8137,"This Great War that united the Greeks was barely touched on. The back story of the villains in this film is more interesting than the story of the 2 - dimensional leads in it. On a positive note, the extras in this film are HILARIOUS. Worth a DVD rental for some fun, but even in 3D it gets old. The story is a long way from reality, Persian characters all have come from the mind of the patient's Writer, This movie is more damaging to Persians and no purpose other than."
8136,"Bill contacts his superior that does not believe in his words. The camera work is outstanding considering such narrow space and the performances are magnificent. Liam Neeson is good, as usual, as an Air Marshall who begins receiving text messages threatening to kill a passenger on board his midair flight (from NY to London) every 20 minutes, unless a huge ransom is paid to a bank account in Neeson's own character's name."
8567,"The music, humor and love rise above the undeniable pain of Mr. Campbell's suffering. Standing tall not only as an incredibly moving and inspirational portrait of Campbell's admirable grace, humor, and above all courage in the face of a dreadful disease, but also as an equally touching and uplifting depiction of a wonderfully tight and compassionate family--doting fourth wife Kim, sons Cal and Shannon, and simply extraordinary daughter Ashley, whose song "" Remembering "" is positively devastating in its sweet emotional candor about her father's unfortunate plight--coming through for their husband and father like gangbusters in his time of greatest need. Slightly marred by rather unnecessary testimonials from various musicians on Campbell's undeniable greatness as a musician (it's almost as if the filmmakers didn't have complete faith in their subject matter), but overall a lovely and affecting tribute to a terrific entertainer who refused to go quietly into the night. It's amazing how his musical talent and wit endures while other memories are lost. At seventy five years old at the time this picture was made in 2011, Campbell at times appears a shell of his former self, while at others, particularly while performing, looks robust and full of energy."
8299,"All the cast are on top form, in orbit around a stellar performance by Benedict Cumberbatch that layers humour, complexity, sexuality and the palpable frustration of a brilliant mind not quite able to communicate with his fellow humans. After impressive performances August: Osage County, 12 Years a Slave, and TV's "" Sherlock, "" this is the role that will make him a bonafide movie star. The film is correct in showing that Turing's genius was using known words from the coded messages to reduce the myriad of possibilities. The performance of Benedict Comberbatch is exceptional, and the rest of the cast good. However, Turing, who is a homosexual, has to wrestle with his secret in order to keep his status and his work years later."
8134,"Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. McConaughey was acting really great, and this is one of the most emotional, if not the most emotional role of his life. The script of the film is very well combined the history of space exploration and the relationship between Cooper and Murph. The story is complex and complicated, is based on real scientific theories by Kip Thorne, and indeed contains a reference to the "" Space Odyssey "" and other sci - fi pictures. In the visual pattern also has some references to the Kubrick's "" Odyssey "", and they are pleasing to the eye."
8133,"It is definitely not comparable laughter-wise to movies such as This Is The End or 21 & 22 Jump Street, but it is very good. It's certainly watchable due to the three leads, but ultimately you're left wishing the movie was good enough to accommodate for the acting talent. And Micheal B. Jordan, wow he was awesome. There are a couple chuckle - worthy moments, and some clever banter between the three guys, but most of the comedy falls flat and the romance is absolutely insane from beginning to end. Zac Efron and Michael B. Jordan turn in acceptable performances but that is overshadowed by the thin - as - ice plot and crude humor, which ends up losing two good performances in the mix."
8177,"This film has greatly polarized critics for its use of controversial concepts. Granted, many aspects of' Lucy' ARE very silly, but visually the film is absolutely stunning and it at least tries to tell an original story and throws in some very interesting philosophical (and yes: even scientific) concepts and questions. Scarlett's charisma, weakness, strength, and acting spill all over the place, even during the most flat scenes of the film, even during the most VFX - packed scenes of the film. What you'll find here, is a well - crafted science fiction yarn that might make you think more than you bargained for while you enjoy the shoot - ups and vehicle crashes. , but' Lucy' is still packed with enough creative ideas and great action scenes to get your money's worth."
8132,"This fast succession of little scenes is done so perfectly, it's a great joy to watch. And there are the great camera angles and the wonderful detailed sets to pay attention to. This was the tale of Gustave H, the legendary and infamous Concierge of The Grand Budapest Hotel, a rather glamorous edifice perched atop a mountain and his protÃ©gÃ© and most trusted friend Zero, The Lobby Boy. Wes Anderson seems to be one of those Directors to look forward to as he has gained a reputation for his quirky eccentricity and stylish flair over the years. The narrative is rather complex as it is handed down from Tom Wilkinson who plays the author who hands the story to his younger self played by Jude Law, who then speaks to Mr Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) who then tells Jude Law his times of when he got a job as a Lobby Boy at the Grand Budapest Hotel, working for the eccentric perfectionist M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes)."
8131,"Regina Hall and Kevin Hart are nearly flawless together, as their banter and angry love provide the most laughs and some of the best moments in the movie. Steve Pink has directed some much funnier comedies in the past (Accepted, Hot Tub Time Machine). Your best movies about relationships usually tend to be those that do not shy away from the more mature subjects and aren't afraid of baring it all physically and emotionally. About Last Night never exaggerates to earn the rating, instead exposes one - night stands, relationships, sex, emotional growth, and all the complications amongst these subjects with no red tape to stop it â€” ultimately establishing itself as a more mature film in its usual cinematic genre. This is more proof that Hart is a comedy genius (and this is coming from someone who doesn't care much for his standup); he just needs the right vehicle to showcase it completely."
8129,"When you push aside all of the inappropriateness and lewd behavior, Barry and Mel are very cute together and that comes out in their strong performances. It was raunchy but so funny, comic timing by Labine and cast was perfect! he is so funny and he's this guy who you'd probably known sometime ago;) The plot is fresh and new,, their are a lot of hilarious scenes,, the writers did a freaking great job. But there's a steady drumbeat of funny situations to keep you entertained, sort of like watching The Simpsons. Yet, the script is very good and there are some VERY funny moments in there, especially the dynamics between the two main characters and their' better living' friends."
8331,"A Most Violent Year is a strong, character - driven drama that's lifted infinitely by terrific lead performances by Oscar Isaacs and Jessica Chastain, inflating what could have been a tiresome, trite look at one man versus the world in an unkind city. Abel Morales (Isaac) runs Standard Oil, and he has his eyes on some prime waterfront real estate. This, of course, is before Abel's company comes under investigation by an intrepid detective (David Oyelowo), his trucks get highjacked and the oil stolen, and his backers start to, well, back away. Both Isaacs (Inside Llewyn Davis) and Chastain (Interstellar) deliver powerful performances that manage to be both relatable and fascinating. The performances are top - notch, beginning with relative newcomer Oscar Isaac in the lead role."
8332,"That ends up perfectly predicting the audience reaction you see here via the reviews. So basically, it's Chris Rock's writing (which is as good as his stand - ups) which makes the movie fun to watch; the movie is semi-autobiographical, and is Rock's best role on screen. Written and Directed by Chris Rock,' Top Five' is a hilarious romantic - comedy, filled with whip - smart observations on people, fame, identity, alcoholism (and will power). The' Planet of the Apes' - Martin Luther King Jr. assassination analogy was quite intriguing and hysterical. Even the supporting characters have fascinating personalities and dialogues."
8562,"The real Bobby Fischer was noticeably tall and slim with very striking facial features: piercing eyes, prominent nose, large, curved lips and a sprinkling of facial moles. He talked like an uneducated Brooklynite who happens to be a headline - making genius; he had a lot of attitude. The film picks up with the arrival of three characters played by brilliant actors: Michael Stahlbarg as Paul Marshall, a sort of fixer / hand - holder, Peter Sarsgaard as Father William Lombardy, a chess master, and Liev Schreiber as Boris Spassky. Bobby runs from journalists' cameras and the fans who want to grab and kiss him. After his match, he could have made millions and enjoyed a cushioned retirement."
8125,"If you're someone who wants to watch themes of love discussed in good and powerful movies, this is one of the best. Peter teaches Beverly how to escape her all - consuming fever by slowing her heart down, Beverly explains to Peter how she believes people rise to the stars to find their loved ones when they die - it's all intensely romantic, but hardly emotional. Pearly is easily the film's best character, unless you count the one played by another of Goldsman's Facebook friends (no spoilers, but this movie star is no doubt grateful to Goldman for a script that earned him bucketfuls of acting cred many years ago). Swimming somewhere in the reams of quite lovely footage assembled by Goldsman and his cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, there's a great movie with great ideas. The Characters were immediately likable and the two child actresses were captivating."
8333,"The technical aspects of the film, particularly the pastel color palette of the photography, as well as the period production design, costumes and makeup, all contribute to the overall charming look and nostalgic feel of the film as a whole. When she outs her husband in the national news, her daughter is proud. Tim Burton has crafted quite a reputation as a director of the surreal and the macabre. On the surface, Big Eyes is right up his alley - this true story of the fiercest and most outrageous copyright battle in art history centres on a series of big - eyed waifs, almost ghostly figures of hope and horror that fit perfectly into Burton's aesthetic. And yet, barring a few scenes, the final film is curiously characterless: a competently - made, shrewdly - cast biopic that never quite troubles the heart or spirit the way Burton's films can do."
8334,"Chris Pines was the ONLY good thing about this movie, and that was basically just for one of his songs which was amusing. Also, several wonderful songs have been cut - it will tick you off. Just stick with televisions, "" Once Upon a Time "", for interesting twists on your favorite fairy tales. Her voice was phenomenal and Stephen Sondheim's musicals are a bit of a challenge to play in. If you don't like musicals, fine!"
8335,"Wow, is there a lot of Serious Acting being Acted here. This film shows the way the Internet changed the relationships people have in real life with others and with themselves. It is through these relationships that Reitman then puts a mirror to the impact of the internet on communication, self - image, parenting, love and sexuality and other topics."
8336,"The Interview has created a lot of crazy rumors and a lot of things have been making this movie one of the biggest happenings this year. Let's get to the IMDb rating first; they are obviously fakes and there are even people on 4chan telling everyone to rate the movie a 10. This is really just to give the creators of the movie the support and love they need after suffering this sad conflict. Also, it is a great opportunity to actually show movie distribution companies that putting movies earlier to watch at home too streaming, WHILE running in cinema will generate A LOT of money. The movie is in no way perfect by all means, but it does have it's surprisingly funny and shocking moments."
8337,"Years ago Tarantino said in an interview that he had written a James Bond script and that he would love to direct a Bond film. But it's also a fantastic action film with an amazing cast (Oscar winners Colin Firth and Michael Caine, plus Sam Jackson AND Mark Hamill) and spectacular, over-the-top fight - scenes that in some instances even rival films like' The Raid' for their sheer visceral intensity. People will have interesting reactions to this film. All of Matthew Vaughn's movies have been good, and he was able to push it further with this one. Samuel L. Jackson plays an odd megalomaniac who makes you laugh more than shiver, which goes with the tone of the movie."
8338,"Perhaps this comedy was the reason why the characters were also a shell of their former glory, and why they were pretty much background characters with the new exhibits. You sit there watching the credits roll by and looking for a new journey to start. This time around, the plot concerns the magical Egyptian artifact that allows the exhibits to come alive."
8339,"In addition, she and her coven of powerful witches (played by Antje Traue, Djimon Hounsou, Jason Scott Lee, among others) get to transform into dragons and similarly fantastic beasts, thanks to neat and nifty computer - generated special effects. But, for pretty much everyone else, Seventh Son is an entertaining, undemanding film with some good ideas and a lot of fun moments. Seventh Son has a lot of potential, the special effects are good, the action scenes are interesting, and the cast is amazing but something doesn't gel. And for that matter, there is no doubt that Thomas will find true love in Alice (Swedish actress Alicia Vikander), a witch whom he rescues from the town mob and who turns out to be the daughter of Malkin's younger sister. There is hardly anything fascinating about' Seventh Son', whose title belongs better in a tongue twister than in an expensive and extravagant swords - and - dragons epic."
8340,"Kudos to the director and of course, to the palpable chemistry of Justin Long and Emmy Rossum which has played a major contribution in making this film a masterpiece indeed. There are some scenes in this movie when director wants its user to interpret the moment in their own way and stick to it. The cast Justin Long and Emmy Rossum did a fine job and the chemistry between them truly works its way to the audience. He manages to show something different this time and Emmy Rossum gives you that sweet and beautiful vibe to the movie. "" Justin Long and Emmy Rossum have excellent chemistry together."
8350,""" Red Army, "" it turns out, uses hockey as a mere vessel for a story about pride, friendships, politics, and passionate devotion to the art of a sport. Polsky's movie is his love letter to hockey and the titular Soviet team, who the film reveals were probably some of the best technical athletes of any age. Superlatives like "" best "" and "" greatest "" came with a heavy price; these guys were not just hockey savants, but devices in a political narrative about the USSR's ability to dominate the world in the waning decades of the Cold War. Red Army illustrates the way of life hockey creates for its players, fans, and country on and off the ice. It's absolutely mesmerizing to watch the dance of the game, the political movements and the life decisions these players and their families are forced to make."
8203,"After all, this is his re-teaming with Denzel Washington after directing him to a Best Actor Oscar twelve years ago in Training Day. It was a good show, featuring the adventures of a retired intelligence agent - turned - private eye named Robert McCall who specialized in helping out the little guy. And Denzel's character is such a good fighter that there is no dramatic tension in the fight scenes. Washington does well playing someone with a dark past who is still good at his game, the action scenes are brutal and fairly exciting, and the movie as a whole looks very nice. Denzel is as awesome as ever in these scenes and the creativity in these scenes are what sets it apart from every other action movie."
8342,"Produced by French - based EuropaCorp, the Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen - scripted' Taken' was one of the most notable action films in recent memory when it was released back in 2008. Key to its success was Neeson, whose viciously efficient qualities as the former CIA badass were excellent complement to the actor's natural gravitas and air of gentleman nobility. Worst of all Forest Whitaker's character Detective Franck Dotzler was said to be smart numerous times, but the grand conclusion he makes at the end of the film is something the audience figured out in ten seconds. None of the clever stuff from the other 2 movies is here."
8204,"The writers made some (for Hollywood movies) unusually daring decisions in having Hiccup face very tough realities in life; especially one about the danger of over-humanizing pets and forgetting about their animal nature. When Disney and Pixar release movies, everybody is excited. This film truly lives up to its expectations and builds upon its predecessor's achievements like any good sequel should, and from this, the outcome is stunning. More mature and thematic than its predecessor,' How to Train Your Dragon 2' is an emotionally resonant and heartfelt flick that expands upon the story of Hiccup and Toothless and their connection. Because of the critical and audience acclaim of the beloved predecessor, many are afraid that a sequel will not match the mastery of the first one, that this would be created purely as a money - making gimmick, like many Hollywood sequels."
8344,"This film seems to have it all: tension that will not let up, characters that will keep you guessing until those credits roll, not to mention some incredible action sequences that put most Hollywood blockbusters to shame, and a dark, heavy plot that unfolds with just the right pace, the perfect amount of twists, along with the perfect amount of heart. This isn't trying to be a groundbreaking heist film and yet it is groundbreaking for Australia, it is so well made, performances are stellar and the score is epic. The film hit that mark, unlike a lot of movies that aren't realistic. The emotion on his face is not only impeccable, it is real - the prison scenes of this movie were actually shot in a prison, with real inmates a part of the background. Ewan McGregor as Brendan Lynch is certainly the best of them, outperforming the other main character - JR (performed by a local heartthrob Brenton Thwaites whose apparent intention was showing his torso as much as possible:)); the latter's relationship with Tasha (nicely performed by Alice Vikander) is a perfunctory link at times - although the pre-ending rounds it up again."
8205,"Speaking of which, Haunt makes a good use of practical effects in order to bring the ghosts and appearances to shape, obtaining some good shocks and moments of a delicious suspense. Maybe this is all coincidental, but the house full of ghosts, the strange neighbor, it all seemed very familiar. Sound effects throughout are very clear and nicely put (for those scary moments you are waiting for to jump off your seat). Scary and frightening like a haunted house movie (the movie's self - aware opening narration describes itself as a ghost story) ought to be, its intensity is too much for PG - 13 but lacks the explicit violence and gore typical for R. Three jump moments were quite effective, which again indicates a PG - 13 level of scariness, but the overall creepiness of the unfolding mystery is even more compelling."
8161,"Co-written & directed by Jim Mickle, this indie keeps shifting its gear which stacks up pretty well in the end as the aura of tension that's present in the film throughout its runtime is nerve - wracking. Camera - work is expertly handled, editing is really good, background score nicely compliments the whole narrative & the tone shifts are carried out in a manner that pulls the viewers in than out. Coming to the performances, the film boasts a badass cast in Michael C. Hall, Sam Shepard & Don Johnson and the trio are fabulous in their given roles. (89%) One of those great little movies that will sadly get seen by far too few, and although it is not a 100% slab of solid gold, it's still a really damn good piece of storytelling. The performances couldn't be much better, Michael C. Hall is perfect as the mullet headed everyman caught in a very tricky spot, and Don Johnson breathes a breath of fresh air into the second half."
8351,"It Follows is a throwback to classic late '70s - '80s horror films and draws many comparisons to John Carpenter's style, from the music to the cinematography, and rather than appearing like a carbon copy or rehash of Halloween, director David Robert Mitchell executes this odd premise with such flair and finesse that you can't help but be refreshed by its cleverness. She is seeing a guy, Hugh, who acts a little odd sometimes but otherwise seems nice and trustworthy so one night she consents to his advances and they share an awkward but intimate moment in the back of his car. It's a slowburner, and the emphasis on mood over jump scares makes it all the more terrifying. Everything about it works, from the brooding pace to the relatable characters, effortlessly sucking you into this gloomy world where STDs can pass on entities that follow you around no matter where you are. It's retro but not dated - heavy on synths and low on bombast, it sets the eerie tone of the movie right from the get - go and elevates the film's effectiveness into the stratosphere."
8352,"NOTE: Kinda sad to see cute little smiling actor kids, especially cute little girls grow up and turn into what the many turn into (not - so - cute - big - heads). The movie itself isn't anything that original but it is tense at the right times and keeps you guessing just enough to make it entertaining and watchable. The original was set in an inner city ghetto, and involved a mostly Black cast (including Samuel L. Jackson, among others.) However, both movies / plots involve drugs gangs, life circumstances of hopeless, abject despair, and a chess - minded wunderkind emerging against all odds in such a setting, then plotting and manipulating to extricate themselves and their loved ones from the deadly morass, culminating in a violent denouement with numerous "" chess pieces "" sacrificed along the way. And that is merely due to the solid commitment of the actors and actresses."
8206,"None of the characters has done anything worth mentioning in all their lives. What's so unique about' Boyhood' is that these individuals (including Ethan Hawke, Patricia Arquette, and Linklater's own daughter, Lorelei Linklater) evolve and age within a scripted narrative that is not' like' a time capsule, this is a completely authentic period piece that retraces an era from the cultural response to September 11th, through the election of Barrack Obama, and into the age of social media saturation. The novelty of watching the family physically grow for 12 years is about as interesting as it sounds, you watch them' physically grow' that's it, that's the big wow factor of the film. Once a year, over the last 12 years, Richard Linklater (' Waking Life' /' Before Sunset') has reunited the same cast and shot segments of a feature film following the life of a boy (played by Ellar Coltrane â€“ who literally grew into this part and became an actor of substance) from the age of 5 through the age of 18; the result is both fascinating and inspired. The great: the idea of following the same boy and others for 11 years."
8207,"Sure it was fun to see everyone on screen playing off one another and enjoying themselves, and everyone turns in fun and great performances, but when Story tries to create dramatic tension, it goes nowhere and rushes by to fast as to get to the next scene with Hart making a fool of himself. The first film followed a group of guys and girls falling in love with one another with all of the ups and downs of a relationship. Here was a chance to make a slick, sexy, glossy movie using the guidance Mr. Harvey provides in his books. Dennis Haysbert, Jennifer Lewis, Tarji Henson, Jim Piddock and Michael Ealy are good actors whose talents were wasted in this movie."
8178,"This movie is a great movie in the sense that it finds its source in the very core of humanity's struggles, and shows that Xmen's themes â€” much like Marvel's latest movies â€” are still very relevant in the world today. With little hope for survival, the desperate X-Men decide to send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time to the 1970s. Rather, this is the work of the Singer who made his mark with films like X1, X2 and The Usual Suspects, all of which featured a masterful blend of wit and wisdom, character and story. Steeped in history and lore, both of the cinematic and comic - book variety, Days Of Future Past feels like a dark love letter to the spirit of that original band of mutants and the message of hope, tolerance and humanity that has always accompanied their attempts to find their place on Earth. 2014 has proved to be a successful year so far for Marvel with' Captain America: The Winter Soldier' and the most recent' X-Men: Days of Future Past'."
8093,"So, is it a good film for the scares? There are worse found - footage movies out there, but The Marked Ones is definitely one you can skip over. Although this one was a little slow to develop in the beginning the last 20 minutes were pretty intense."
8226,"Science adds new discoveries and corrects old theories constantly as it progresses. So if you enjoy seeing beautiful people asking seemingly profound questions in interesting settings, this is your movie."
8208,"His family, his friends, dreams and aspirations are all present. He was also one of the most outspoken and inspired activists fighting to keep the internet free, protecting the rights and privileges of the American people whose government was trying tirelessly to censor the free speech granted by the web. Though the film does not break new ground stylistically, the interviews with Aaron's family, girlfriends, and friends such as Net activists Tim Berners - Lee who created the World Wide Web and author Cory Doctorow are illuminating and often inspiring. Swartz defended his action in hacking MIT's computers in a manifesto that read in part, "" Information is power. Originally indicted on four counts, after his SOPA campaign was successful, Carmen Ortiz, U. S. Attorney for the district of Massachusetts, upped the number of counts to thirteen to "" send a message . """
8209,"Gelvatron has a really nice plottwist and some scenes are decently funny. The only redeeming aspects of this movie are the exceptional CGI with some stunning 3D and the incredible sound. When sh*t does start hitting the fan later, it's just a bloody mess, with so much happening at once that you don't care about anything and none of it is particularly cool or memorable."
8172,"It's well made as in it looks good, some interesting direction especially in the party scenes but there is just nothing else. Zach and Seth were on a great path of making great movies, it seems they either smoked or drank their last paycheck and needed some more money and did this. Quit having your writers put in sex scenes with you and the obviously unattainable women you are cast with. Why did it get such good reviews from critics and such a high score on IMDb?"
8168,"Brick Mansions is unimpressive, but crazy to say, also enjoyable. With tempered expectations though, Walker fans and action fans may find enough here for mild satisfaction. Brick Mansions moves the action to the United States, and adds Paul Walker as a co-star in order to have a famous name; and from the original film, it preserved the presence from David Belle in the role of an ex-convict with a golden heart whose incredible "" abs "" and acrobatic ability are indispensable for him to navigate the dangerous territory of Detroit, where the story is developed (even though, ironically, most of the film was shot in Canada). Â¨ Brick Mansions Â¨ is an amazing film that packs suspense, thrills, noisy action, shootouts and violent fights. It may sound politically correct, but he really is the best thing about Brick Mansions."
8100,"Ben is in love with Angela (Tika Sumpter) and wants Angela's brother, James, (Ice Cube) to give them his blessing to get married. He's in a loving relationship with Angela Payton (Tika Sumpter), who's very proud of Ben when he's accepted into the police academy. What it lacks in memorable action, it makes up for in it's funny scenes and dialogues. Also, though the film has some decent action scenes, they are completely derived and none of the scenes stand out as fresh and long - lasting. Buddy - cop action comedies are never about great plot - lines."
8363,"Most romance pictures today involve very young, very beautiful people and not people in their 80s! A freshly widowed 80 - isn man, Christopher Plummer as Fred Barcroft, is moving into the adjacent condo. This is a very nice movie, character studies of two people in the twilight time of their lives. It isn't the kind of movie that can attract decent audiences at theaters against mega-buck blockbusters, but it is a very nice smaller movie with some of the best actors of their times. Written by Anna Pavignano and Michael Radford (who also directs), the story is given its best shot by Shirley MacLaine (age 80) and Christopher Plummer (age 85) but the saccharine ending is a bit too heavy to hold up the good moments."
8366,"She does parts that secure her reputation of being a talented American' cutie', she plays' off - beat' characters with ease. but Ms Aniston makes a brilliant job of it. Perhaps it was because of lowered expectations, but this was a perfectly fine, solid film. Barraza injects a lot of humanity and compassion in her character, even if sadly, she's not given as much screen time as she deserves. It's a beautiful, heartrending scene, and the decision to rest Cake on Jennifer Aniston's shoulders was absolutely the right one."
8367,"He wants a real love and something real to do every day and if he achieve anything beyond mediocrity then he would rather be dead. Each give amazing performances, especially Goodman who steals some scenes from Wahlberg with colorful monologues filled with expletives and subtext that is classic William Monohan but it does grow tiring after awhile. Walhbergs character is pretty unique, and borders on unbelievable, but it very consistent and represents very real emotions. Wahlberg is surrounded by other performers, who work equally well at matching his level of conviction, specifically Goodman, whose few scenes in the film amount to greatness in a predictable yet pleasant manner. The Gambler features great performances from Mark Wahlberg and Jessica Lange along with flashy and stylish direction from Rupert Wyatt."
8195,"The conversations the two lead characters share are quite moving and thought - provoking, and the monologue Junn has towards the end on the essence of grief and crying is really beautiful. Echoes of Wong Kar Wai resonate beautifully throughout this very moving and understated, and yet very funny film. But it is Ben Whishaw, who's character has to balance ALL these realities in this drama, who gives a shattering and achingly constrained performance. The two leads, Ben Whishaw and Pei - pei Cheng, give quite strong and incredible performances; they have a few immensely moving scenes. "" Lilting "" is an ambitious attempt to portray the cultural differences at play in a modern relationship."
8371,"No big deal at all, just a bunch of amateurs going in a bank and hope they don't get caught. Adrien Brody gave a decent performance as a man who got broken in his decade in prison, but this performance goes over weakly in this mediocre film that did not develop his character enough for Brody's attempts at heart breaking scene stealing. Let's just pop in the bank with guns, take everyone hostage and hope nobody notices from outside."
8159,"The dark mountains and pounding seas which sandwich the village are as atmospherically filmed as they were in David Lean's RYAN'S DAUGHTER, and a fine score boosts the film's seesaw moves between comedy and tragedy. and the rest of the cast turn in believable performances. Excellent performances by Pat Short and Dylan Moran. Calvary is a powerful film with great performances and some sharp writing, and that is why this is one of the must see films of 2014. Despite knowing who his threat is, Father James spends the time ministering to his parishioners â€” including his killer's domestic issues, preserving the sacred privacy of the confessional."
8211,"Ronson based the film's main character, Jon (Domhnall Gleeson) on himself; both real and fictional Jon found themselves randomly in this band, ditching their existing lives in pursuit of musical greatness, trying to make sense of the enigma of the man in the giant head. The first half of "" Frank "" focuses more on the creative process and the mental headspace necessary to operate at peak creativity. At the same time, this leads to an honest, moving redemptive arc in the final half hour of the movie, when this bizarre flower of a story opens up to reveal its fragile insides. To protect Sievey from speculations about how obsessive he was about Frank, Ronson decided to fictionalise the film version. The musicians are all a bit barking and the beautiful Maggie Gyllenhaal is the craziest."
8212,"All through that you can't stop wondering why you love those romantic novels and movies as much as you do:) Some episodes were a bit bizarre, but in general the movie is a good one. If you love to laugh at the expense of cheesy romcoms, then you're in for a real treat. Not every joke lands, and most of them go by so quickly it could all be a 30 Rock cutaway, but nevertheless this movie is a delight for anyone who has noticed how brainless and predictable most romantic comedies end up being. It seemed like it was going to poke fun at romcoms while still maintaining a grounded story and genuine romance. Paul Rudd and Amy Poehler (who worked with Wain on "" Wet Hot American Summer "") have very good chemistry and the rest of the cast laughs along with them."
8213,"The story is original - talking planes fighting forest fires - can't recall that being done before. Following the old adage, promise low, deliver high, Planes Fire and Rescue does just that; it promised little, and delivered more, showing that they may have learned from the lackluster cars 2. As such there are nods, often irreverently funny, to some of the recognizable entities in their other films. They may have gone a little overboard on the fire, but the concern for Dusty is the anchor that keeps you engaged throughout the film. So now on to the film, Dusty Crophopper has won many trophies."
8214,"Like so many movies emanating from the high & mighty in Hollyweird, tucked away in their mansions & gated BelAir communities, "" Tammy "" simply sneers down from on high, at the "" awful low - life rednecks "". Tammy boasts a pretty good cast from Susan Surrandon to Kathy Bates and Toni Collette, it has all the ingredients to make a pretty good film. As Tammy's grandmother, she at least straps on her acting gear and succeeds with a few lovely moments, but frankly her talent is not justified nor is it utilized properly. There's one sequence, where McCarthy has to rob a fast food restaurant, which provides some laughs, but the entire sequence was played in the trailer. Comedian Aisha Tyler once stated that comedians should take the first punch during their stand - up / hosting / entertaining performances."
8215,"You believe everything these characters are doing, and that's what makes this movie work so well. One thing people must know about the film is it's not generally about The Babadook monster. This is pretty much the most compelling view of the film, which makes them reasonably trapped into their own nightmares. The performances of the two leads are outstanding for bringing the real heart of the picture. The acting is amazingly good from the two leads, although the supporting characters are a bit stereotyped, a directing decision presumably."
8194,"the premise is simple: take a self - involved ambitious businessman and stick him with three talented but hungry baseball prospects and they end up changing each other for the better. if you love baseball movies or know kids who love baseball (or any sports for that matter), Million Dollar Arm is a must - see feel good film. What he seems to have missed is that he's brought two human beings halfway across the world just to make a successful business move. There's also other great performances in this movie from the likes of Aasif Mandvi, Alan Arkin, Bill Paxton and Tzi Ma, but this will suffice. It will certainly join the ranks of all the great sports movies."
8216,"After picking Andrew to play in the school band, he pushes Andrew to his limits in order to realize his full potential, at the risk of his humanity. Two fantastic performances from Miles Teller and J. K. Simmons. Whiplash is low budget film making at its finest, and surely promises big things from rookie director / writer Damien Chazelle. First everything about this film was stellar; casting, writing, acting, directing, music and cinematography all came together to just tell an incredible story. Great job to all involved and congrats on winning the award at Sundance, you certainly earned it."
8217,"For starters, it is portrayed as this suspenseful thriller where there are constant twists and turns and you never really know what is truly happening. The acting is decent to middling, with Affleck probably giving one of the better performances overall, and Tyler Perry actually being an enjoyable aside. Also, apparently even though she plotted all along to have her husband executed, she somehow had the presence of mind to save the sperm sample, keep it, then AFTER he is exonerated and she has to alter her plans to return to him last minute after murdering someone else, has the means to get it successfully implanted in herself. By far one of the best acting performances to have come from Ben Affleck,' Gone Girl' boasts some strong yet disturbing portrayals from Rosamund Pike, Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry and Affleck."
8219,"It is wonderfully coherent, and offers insights into the man, into his extraordinary talents and his tremendous enthusiasm, not just for film but for life and the people he loved. The documentary "" Life Itself "", which touches on many aspects of Ebert's life and work, is unmissable for any fan. It flows through pretty easily and seamlessly, the editing isn't too fast - paced but instead lingers on Ebert's more philosophical viewpoints in his book. The face on the movie poster was very recognizable: Roger Ebert, Pulitizer Prize winning film critic for the Chicago SunTimes, celebrated television reviewer, and one of the foremost advocates of film history. The film chronicles Ebert's rise to fame in the sixties as an ambitious reporter to becoming a syndicated film personality (along with his fellow critic, Gene Siskel) on his highly popular programs, Sneak Previews, At the Movies, and finally Siskel & Ebert which brought him fame and fortune in the next decades."
8383,"Kudos to those involved with casting as every actor / actress, from the leading Andrew Garfield and Michael Shannon, right down to those who were only in one or two scenes, did a really good job. Holding his own against a larger than life acting force that is Shannon, Garfield's Nash allows himself to feed off Carver's greed and sinisterly convincing monologues with scenes of heart - wrench, grit and sensitivity. Then you have someone like Carver who's at the different end of the spectrum and doing everything right for himself but he is someone who makes his big dough from forcing people out of their own homes and in the wrong way. But with an actor like Shannon, one of the most confident and reliable actors working today, Bahrani needs not have this fear of relinquishing control of character development. Nash's choices and inner struggle is a sharp and dangerous double - edged sword."
8220,"Among Hollywood's recent output of mediocre (and in some cases: downright abysmal) remakes of Sci - Fi classics,' Rise of the Planet of the Apes' was the rare movie which stood out, for it had as much of a brain as it had a heart â€“ plus an original approach to the well - known material and great visuals. Having said that,' Rise' practically pales in comparison to Matt Reeves' sequel: the upcoming' Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' is as close to a Science - Fiction masterpiece as a 170 million PG - 13 Hollywood summer blockbuster can possibly get. This is no light - hearted, comic - book - style fantasy film with fun, over-the-top action scenes. But the core of this film â€“ and also the reason why the action scenes in the third act really do have an impact and all the mayhem really gets to you â€“ is the intelligent, skilfully told story with its well - drawn, believable characters (portrayed by equally believable actors). Rise of the Planet of the Apes was a refreshing and involving take on an old franchise and director Rupert Wyatt set up such promise for its sequel."
8192,"Most unexpected of all, the main reason the comical aspects during the first half of the film work so well, is Tom Cruise's character, Major William Cage. Bill Paxton and Brendon Gleeson are always a welcome addition to any movie, and while they are great (as usual), character-wise, they don't do anything here that you haven't seen them do before. The battle scenes are beautifully orchestrated (not the Transformer - style blur where you can't make out anything anymore), and there are moments when the intensity of the fighting recalls the landing on Omaha Beach in' Saving Private Ryan' - without the gore, obviously (after all, this is PG - 13). The CGI and the special effects are seamless and bring the great set pieces and the relentless aliens to life. The script also manages to pull off some quite funny scenes (especially in the training segment)."
8191,"Liam Neeson's casting as the villain was indeed a good choice and he pulls off the role very well, especially alongside the stunning Charlize Theron in all her glory. After a chance encounter during a bar fight, Anna (Charlize Theron) takes an immediate liking to Stark, and agrees to help him win back the heart of his lost love, but omitting her true identity could have grave consequences when Clinch discovers who she's spending her days with. It's not a timeless piece of comedy, but it's got spunk, wonderful production values, inspired comedic acting (even the' bit' roles), and it has well - turned moments of stunningly genuine romance. Comedy westerns have a strong legacy through classics like Mel Brooks' "" Blazing Saddles "", "" Support your Local Sheriff / Gunfighter "" (with James Garner), "" Paleface "" and "" Son of Paleface "" (with Bob Hope and Jane Russell) all the way back to the brilliant "" Destry Rides Again "" (with James Stewart and Marlene Dietrich). The photography of the Utah locations is gorgeous."
8223,"It's a movie full of warmth of human relationships, and that makes it a really lovely and also touching and very delicate in many parts of it. It's movie about the up's and down's of life, but full of positive emotions who come out of persons with a quite rough life. The opening credits come with background of endearing "" Both sides now "", which is a brilliant choice so aptly setting the mood of the entire movie. Sterling Jerins the little girl from the Conjuring plays the grand daughter and she is very sweet and touching."
8224,"It was definitely a step back for Katie Findlay and Craig Roberts after seeing them play some outstanding roles such as Maggie Landers on The Carrie Diaries and Oliver Tate in Submarine, but it was also nice to see some new faces making their way into the movie industry, especially the lead, John Karna. Even though it's a mash - up of Groundhog Day and American Pie, meaning it lacks originality, and has one of the most clichÃ© "" plot twists "" of all time, it's still oddly hilarious."
8225,"Diaz handles it better than Segel and she's definitely doing her best to keep the film going. Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz are funny actors, but these are already very familiar roles for them and they seem to just be sleepwalking through them. Jason Segel, usually a very likable everyday type only annoys everyone from the beginning, and Diaz can't lend any credibility to her role as the wife of this loser. The script for, say, "" Caddyshack "" had to have looked so sophomoric that the suits must have thought themselves crazy to green - light that project, but it made a fortune and is now considered a classic comedy. The supporting cast featuring Rob Lowe and Rob Corddry do generate most of the laughs, it again doesn't make for anything of a redeeming quality."
8390,"The premise of the movie is the best part about it: Five guys have the keys to a secret loft where they can freely cheat on their wives, but one day they find a dead girl on the bed and have to figure out who did it. They are likable actors and they have some moments of conviction here and there, but the script is so horrendous it's astonishing that they can keep a straight face delivering these lines. However the cokehead brother completely embraces the psychosis angle and gives a very nice standout performance considering the material he was given. In a little more detail, the plot of the movie is based around 5 guys sharing a loft where they can bring their mistresses (which is refreshingly original, even though it's a remake of a remake) and eventually end up involved in an investigation that could land them all in jail."
8101,"There are a couple of scenes that deliver good suspense. Movie reviews, news, chat, even the occasional free ticket giveaway. All in all, the story line, chronology, acting etc in this movie are okay, but too clichÃ© as most scenes are predictable."
8227,"Every moment you think is safe leads directly into the next moment of pressure for the main characters, and you can't help but sympathize for the characters who (all but one) don't even want to be stuck out here on this horrid night. The action scenes are done well, and the tension is enough to keep interest even in the low parts of the film. The satire is about as subtle as a round of bullets to the chest and the film never feels comfortable during the few moments the story calms down to spend time developing the characters, but this was made for visceral thrills and B grade enjoyment. A lot of themes are explored--Human Nature, Fear, Anger, Revenge, Heroism--in ways that many other movies don't really explore it. The characters were all very well written, most of which were wildcards and constantly keeping the audience guessing."
8189,"While Zombeavers doesn't have any flying sharks, it has virtually everything else you could possibly want in a so - bad - it's - good movie and then some. There is also a lot of "" real "" effects, so you see the "" monsters "" as puppets. The movie also rounds up the story very nicely, so if you liked the first couple of minutes, you'll like the movie as a whole. If you enjoy zombie comedies such as "" Dead Alive "" or "" Shaun of the Dead "" then you will also like "" Zombeavers "". The script rarely wastes any time; once the zombeavers are introduced, the pace is effective."
8229,"Guardians of the Galaxy is nothing short of an amazing movie. All the actors do a great job at portraying there characters, they feel real beings. For those that want specifics: effects were top notch, acting was excellent, story lines were compelling, the comedy was perfect 99. Marvel certainly have made sure the Guardians have plenty of publicity, turning a bunch of also rans into a must see event and even having the confidence to proclaim "" The Guardians Of The Galaxy Will Return "" at the end of the movie. After a truly heartbreaking beginning everything goes a bit daft, mixing swashbuckling sci fi action with larger than life characters, and whilst at first you may be a little puzzled, it all streamlines into a simple plot soon enough."
8230,"There are less jokey references to the stars previous roles than in Expendables 2, and it is much effective than the infinite amount in Ex2. Their leader, Barney (Stallone), to keep the rest of his Expendables brethren safe, goes on a suicide mission with a new younger team to exact revenge. The Expendables series was supposed to be bring back the thrills of the great 80s action films. The movie follows The Expendables on a mission to stop a weapon's trade, they discover an old foe once thought dead (Gibson), takes out one of their own. OK Harrison Ford is his usual gray self but Antonio Banderas shines in every scene he is in mixing pathos and humor in a heady mix of, "" why has he not been the lead in anything more than the cat in Shrek "", for so long."
8231,"However, as an artistic representation of not only the myths, but a possible truth behind the myths, this was an entertaining watch. This film has pulled a complete "" World - War - Z "" and left absolutely EVERYTHING about the original mythology out except for the fact that it is called "" Hercules "". You know, of Hercules and his amazing feats of heroism? Everything from beginning the film with the ever popular "" you think you know the story of Hercules? For those hoping for popcorn fare, a little gory for a ten year old but just about right for a 13 or 14 year old, for those hoping for solid acting performances, well - choreographed fight scenes, and pretty high production values, then this is your show."
8232,"In 1976 Turkiewicz, then a film student, attempted to make a film about her mother, simply called Helen. Sophia also draws upon extensive archival material and actual footage of the camps to give audiences some understanding of the historical context of her mother's journey. There are also lots of family photographs and moving interviews with her mother as she slowly teases out details about her experiences. She also follows in her footsteps to Italy, and later makes a moving and eye opening visit to the home of her biological father to meet her other family. Turkiewicz has been fascinated by her mother's experiences, and her sense of compassion and understanding have informed many of her own films, especially the short Letters From Poland, and the the 1984 AFI award winning drama Silver City, which explored the experiences of Polish immigrants arriving in Australia."
8233,"The final moments of Anton Corbijn's latest film A Most Wanted Man are both gratifying and poetic. Starring an impeccable cast that includes the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, Rachel McAdams, Willem Dafoe, and Robin Wright, the film is based on the novel by John le CarrÃ©, and is a tension - driven and smartly paced thriller ride that makes a mark as one of the year's best rides. Like many of CarrÃ©'s books that have been translated to film like Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and The Constant Gardener, there's an aura that exudes from the screen that you want to take home with you. While the tween world waits on the arrival of the final two installments to The Hunger Games, this film felt more of his goodbye to the film community that has appreciated him for over two decades. She relaxes herself into the role, working well off some of the screen's most gifted performers."
8152,"All three shine in their scenes, and all seem to be up for all the fun of your typical Muppet movie, but Fey really stood out in her song "" In The Gulag "". The plot, as you may already be aware, involves some creative switcharoo, which is played off very well. This sequel only exists probably just to fit in, but then again it's still a very fun time at the movies. This quality is always a welcome, however the storyline doesn't seem to offer anything new or say anything important. This edition tries to be like any blockbuster today by pulling off a bombastic and thrilling tone since it involves criminal schemes and exciting mysteries, but these aren't the most interesting parts the film has."
8234,"The premise of two respected comedians doing a semi - scripted trip around a set of Italian restaurants had some good potential. If you are planning to see this movie to be overwhelmed by beautiful Italian landscapes or cuisine, don't bother: see any documentary of Discovery or National Geographic on Italia and you'll be less bored and annoyed. Beautiful food is given a brisk token summary of a Benidorm - type review, while unbearable fractured Italian and pompous guide - book knowledge makes one wish their inflated boat would sink immediately with their over-inflated egos. The restaurants featured in the series are researched and quite extraordinary. The series is very easy to watch, clever, witty, and with superb impressions, but most of all the on screen chemistry this pair have is what makes the show."
8404,"Inside jokes abound here, and Dupieux takes a few shots at the filmmaking business, and what constitutes creativity. Dupieux lines up again into a circular, nearly closed form of movie - making, that allows him to break out into freedom. the award is presented by Oscar winning director Michel Hazanavicius (The Artist) and Roxane Mesquida (who was in Rubber)."
8188,"The CGI is a tad heavy and a little freaky at times (such as the three coloured pixies / Aunts) but was used, in combination with some amazing sets, to create a fantastic world and creatures which were reminiscent of the beautiful and imaginative work in movies such as "" Hellboy 2 "" and "" Pan's Labyrinth "". The effort by the art team here really helps to draw you into Maleficent's world at the beginning of the movie and makes you wish you were a kid growing up with this movie as fodder for your imagination. The plot naturally goes along with coherent and succinct narrations that add an in - depth storytelling. Not to mention a good composition that captures significant moments without boredom. The critics complaining about this film want "" fairy tales "" to stay in the same "" one - love - fits - all "" mode where people are either good or evil and that all one needs is to find "" romantic "" love and marry a "" good "" Prince or Princess, and you will live "" happily ever after, "" safe from any pain or sorrow."
8187,"There are some funny moments like her friends with pictures of a dog. In comes the hilarious, handicapped teenager living next door who serves as the antidote to all her problems. This movie is so smartly written by Amy Lowe Starbin. Some of the best scenes at the beginning include the two of them bullshitting and having a great time talking about their problems, and nothing more than that. But though it starts off well (maybe even excellent) it soon deteriorates in a slow decline that ends when the credits roll."
8236,"The set deigns are good as is the music segments, but James deserved a much better film, and the lead as well. Boseman steals the show, managing to bring a lot of energy and fun into the enigmatic Brown. Despite the order of the scenes though, Get On Up has some impressive production behind the movie. If a film maker chooses to focus on the artistry and creativity that came forth from an individual then it is best not to delve too deeply into the demons, which for James Brown (Chadwick Boseman) were much bigger than portrayed in this film. From the very beginning "" Get on Up "" plays as though Taylor had seen a linear cut of his finished product, wasn't happy with it and then decided to put scenes in random order, with the thought that maybe it would make it a more entertaining watch."
8158,"Garfield and Stone has their chemistry and does their best with the incredibly thin script and cheesy one - liners, but their potential quite beautiful scenes together gets lost in the over-full and messy plot. It's amazing how the difference between two big - budget superhero - movies can be so huge, if you put this against "" Captain America: The Winter Soldier "", a great and, opposed to this one, original film. The sequel still holding up today as one of the best superhero movies of all time. Director Marc Webb finally lets the smart but dorky Parker shine in a few scenes that are hilarious and engaging. The action is fun, fast and so Spider - Man if that means anything."
8185,"The African bits are a joy to see. He went from doing hilarious and heartfelt comedies that only he can do, to stupid and meaningless comedies and second grader can do better. If you're looking for the Sandler of 15 years ago, or the scoop of septic that the current comedic "" geniuses "" have to offer (Rogen, Attepow, etc.,) then stay home and watch for umpteenth time the "" hilarious "" back and forth between Franco and Seth in This Is Then End. For Blended is reasonable, and funny and OK for older kids, as some of them are facing the same issues that the kids portrayed here are. His a few last attempts were really bad movies but this time he got it right again."
8238,"MITM is a totally pleasant whimsical delight. but it's a fun summery concoction of scenery, whimsy and costumes. This Stanley is an upper class version of the Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire (which Allen drew upon for his previous Blue Jasmine--see separate blogs). So Stanley makes a career out of being a magician, providing showbiz illusions, and the alliterative parallel Sophie makes her living â€” with sumptuous prospects now â€” out of bolstering her gulls with assuring lies from the dead. As such, it is one of Allen's most personal and thought - provoking films in years."
8239,"They can bring as much surprises as the events do. But even with all those great comedy bits, there are quite a few creepy moments in the movie that gets your heart pounding. Part ghost story, part murder mystery, it would be counter - productive to know any more about the plot before viewing, as various revelations and red herrings keep the mystery quotient high. Housebound is a very pleasant surprise comedy horror gem from New Zealand, but with nicely done scares and a creepy atmosphere to go with the chuckles, which come mainly via hilarious interactions with the dysfunctional trio. Horror - comedies are difficult to pull off, and it's rare that a film strikes a genuine balance without ending up as a full - on horror with a darkly comic edge, or an out - and - out comedy with horror themes, but Housebound gets very close to doing so."
8196,"In his depression he stops talking to girl (because romantic movies need a moment of sad separation which can always be easily resolved after some days by talking). Even though his value on the meat market is much higher than the protagonist girl's value, he only has eyes for her, even without her saying anything but depressing things. He could get anything for himself, but he decides to give his special once in a lifetime cancer wish to her, even though they are not boyfriend / girlfriend, they have not had sex, they haven't even kissed yet. The pacing was perfect, the acting was phenomenal, the direction, editing and cinematography was exceptional and overall, this movie is one of the best romantic comedies that have ever touched the face of the earth. This movie, simply put, is worth each and every one of its 125 minutes."
8241,"In 1990, April O'Neil was the hot shot news reporter that made the amazing discovery of the Turtles and she developed an amazing bond with them. The biggest violations however, lay with Donatello and Splinter, as it seems they thought that hyper - charging the characters would somehow make them interesting, endearing or watchable. That "" honor "" would go to William Fichtner's character, Eric sounds - like - sex Sacks. Leonardo, the brave leader, was completely robbed of his personality, characteristics, leadership and anything that would define him, and has always in the past. And he learns Ninjitsu from a book in the sewer, gone is any mysticism or any pivotal, emotional, or vital connection to important characters in the story."
8242,"The detailed characterization of the book and the sensory stimulating scenes in the film complement each other nicely to make one cohesive, stunning, and powerful story. Yet in Hollywood they are ultimately a means to write the next big blockbuster to draw people to the theaters. Thwaites' chemistry with him is good, the boy not only reacting to the new memories, but also trying to handle everything that comes with them. Perhaps the greatest source of emotion though come from the memories that the two protagonists share. Katie Holmes and Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd showed flawless acting in their supporting roles as well."
8415,"The premise is good, Max steps into other persons' lives and also the wrong crowd, whose lives are far more diverse than his. The body switching subgenre has a few predictable twists, the film also faces this problem, but it creates scenes with enough refinement that makes them refreshing and presentable. Though it's not all gold, it is definitely better than maniac laughs in Grown Up which isn't infectious at all. The screenplay is tight,, perfectly written, the movie itself is purposeful,, like literally "" put yourself in somebody's shoes "" what would you do! Of course, there were plenty of moments full of genuine sentiment, with lots of lessons to be learned."
8157,"If you love action movies and would love to turn your brain off for a moment then this is your candy. It has everything a perfect martial arts movie has to have, and it deserves to be regarded as one of the best in its genre. A barrage of set - action sequences from a muddy prison (uncontrollable chaos) to several people being decimate with the use of a baseball bat and a pair of claw hammers (with close - up gore that can only rival horror movies), a fantastic car chase that might have been the one of the very best choreographed sequence in recent memory and a final fight scene that will leave you breathless from its intensity and insanity. This man is a genius in terms of visually expressing action through vivid, mind - blowing camera - work. Overall, The Raid 2 is arguably one of the best sequels ever, and even one of the best martial arts movies ever."
8546,"Jennifer Lawrence somehow shines through in the lead, and Isabella Rossellini does her best to enliven her scenes, but that's about where the positives end. It is a wonderful story that should have received better reviews. Lawrence and David O. Russell take you on an emotional journey with "" Joy . "" probably one of the best films of 2015 Miss, Lawrence delivered one of her most powerful performance to the screen, and even though she won an Oscar for (Silver Linings Playbook 2012) her performance here is much more powerful. Joy is the story of a strong woman that fights against all odds and wins."
8240,"Channing Tatum and Sean Bean in particular gave great performances, and Eddie Redmayne as the primary antagonist was decent as well. Good on Mr. Redmayne because he succeeded. Unless you want to see some really great CGI for a couple hours, which can be found in much better places by the way, you won't find anything worth salvaging from Jupiter Ascending. "" Jupiter Ascending "" is fun, is spectacular, and is in no way sillier than the original' Star Wars' (as in episode IV). Jupiter Ascending actually paints a pretty fascinating sci - fi universe."
8290,"Ex Machina has a simple story dealing with a deeply complex and philosophical topic: namely what makes humans human. Bates lives in the middle of the American wilderness (in reality, a very picturesque Norway) and in a property that actually exists (BlueBook the Juvet Hotel). Domhnall Gleeson' character (Caleb) works for BlueBook and wins the Wonka Golden Ticket to spend a week with Nathan, becoming the human side of the test. Ava is the beautiful and seductive android subject and the film clinically walks through the sessions between Caleb and Ava, watched over by Nathan via the villa's comprehensive CCTV system. She is also an excellent actress, having to reflect a wide range of emotions through little else than her eyes."
8312,"You may have heard some critics champion Jurassic World as "" The best Jurassic Park sequel "", some fans declare that it "" brought them back to their childhood "", and others who may have made the absurd claim, "" It's better than the original "". That being said, in a time of dark, self - serious, and pretentious blockbusters such as last year's Dawn of the Planet of the Apes or Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight films, Jurassic World is a refreshing antidote. Light, wholesome, and heavy on adventure, JW harkens back to the big Hollywood "" event "" blockbusters of the 80s and 90s. Alan Grant, Ellie Satler, Ian Malcolm, and the rest of the appealing and memorable characters of the earlier movies are replaced with broad movie archetypes and superfluous supporting characters. After a re-branding of sorts, John Hammond's dream is finally realized and Jurassic Park is opened and fully operating."
8317,"Both great movies, but NOTHING similar about them. The Scorch Trials got some great and intense, action packed scenes, good acting and cool environments but that's it. The surviving teens from the Maze Runner link up with kids from other Mazes, and the first one of them to arrive at the prison - like complex shows Thomas, the film's hero, enough to make him question a conspiracy against the teens. The teens then reach a settlement and decide that they want to hook up with the resistance, because The Hunger Games are so popular."
8341,"If you like Neill Blomkamp's directing and style you will love this movie. This is a great movie definitely in the style of Niell Blomkamp. They really went all out with Yolandi and Ninja (the main characters part of the musical group Die Antwoord). The technology in this movie is fantastic, as usual coming from Blomkamp, leaving plenty of ideas for the imagination to wonder about for the future. Dev Pattel is well cast, did the role total justice."
8343,"In reality, if computers are depicted in realistic terms in film, most people just wont get it. Further, the types of attacks are entirely plausible given real world research conducted by the NSA, Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and others. Once again, it feels like a film from a different time period that hearkens back to the classic noir movies of yesteryear, something like Three Days of the Condor."
8345,"The whys and hows of the T - 1000 were cleverly hidden away and never discussed. The story is convincing enough and can be the prelude of new additions to this series. The special effects are not always the best, but most parts look great. This movie is best viewed in normal 2D."
8353,"Tom Hardy breaths life into Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron is excellent and emotionally perfect as Furiosa. This movie is so incredibly filmed and the stunts are performed marvelously. Although this movie is said to star Tom hardy and Charlize Theron, the real star here is George miller. You have the high - powered Warrior Rig driven by Furiosa. This is an action movie that will set a precedent for years to come, roaring ferociously at all who may challenge it."
8354,"He works hard for the money, sooo hard for the money, he works hard for the moneeey and still can't get it right! On the one hand, the 1977 film Star Wars was a masterpiece on the other Episode VII is a naked cash grab that could have been making fun of the Star Wars phenomenon."
8357,"Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) is a MARVEL damn good superhero flick and an excellent sequel! James Spader did a terrific excellent job playing Ultron. Avengers: Age of Ultron is a 2015 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. Camera angles that were purposefully shot for the intentional thrill of 3D is like any other angles used in any other 3D - movie - going - experience. But good moments don't make a good movie."
8358,"Ants who are a friendly team, attract a lot of attention, manifesting themselves from different sides, and to discover and discover something new and amazing in its own way is always pleasant. They were in demand and needed, because they always taught a good cause: they clearly demonstrated how to be persistent and strong; how to overcome difficulties and obstacles; To reach heights and conquer new horizons; be able to love and offer a helping hand in a difficult moment; and most importantly - to remain yourself, soul and heart. Michael Pena was great in this film, he plays the same kind of character he always seems too, but it really works, especially the story telling scenes were hilarious. The are two post credit scenes which are fantastic and really tie into the larger universe. But on moments where he and Lang engage in beautifully - choreographed fight scenes, the ineptitude gets relegated below the more important aspects of the proceedings, and once it does, the breathtaking visual schemes work under the spotlight, capturing Lang's size - changing skill with epic elaborateness."
8359,"Based on a scientific project that Reed Richards (Miles Teller) has been developing (which can transfer matter from one dimension to another) the Fantastic Four use themselves as Guinea Pigs in order to transfer themselves to another dimension (in the belief that there is something in this other worldly dimension that will benefit their own planet). It had potential and it looked like it could go somewhere, especially considering how superhero movies nowadays have managed to flesh out their stories and make them very enjoyable. Fantastic Four is a film very much out of time and place in today's market of superhero movies. ' Chronicle' may have been a perfect calling card for Trank, but' Fantastic Four' shows a young, inexperienced director completely out of his depth, absolutely justifying the advance bad buzz it had spent months battling. Compared to this, the old movies seem good."
8368,"Complete and total thumbs down to the movie, the book, the series, and to the author. Sometimes imagination is more powerful than just about anything and can give you an erotic experience. This film doesn't fulfill the most inane imagination, let alone someone who really has a wild and creative one. The man in the relationship, Chris, in a career - ending performance portrayed by Jamie Doormat, is a control - freak who must be in control in everything he does, including the life of his BDSM buddy, Ana."
8373,"It's a fresh idea,, new definitions and it's kinda purposeful which makes it a bit exciting. to be fair,, this project would look so much better as a TV movie or probably as a series on CBS, and it could hit huge success, but the idea of series based on these type of stories is not really new on TV (like "" Awkward "" 6 seasons so far on MTV which is a success),, the plot seemed entangled but it went toward a clear goals. again Ken Jeong in the beginning of the movie,, he was really funny,, the girl from "" parenthood "";) Mae Whitman she has flown up high to be really good funny gal and all the other girls as well were fine,, Chris Wylde was hilarious in the end of the movie: D,, Robbie Amell really good acting all popular and careless. with a funny bits from another perspective and not forgetting to shine a light on cyber bullying problem. The object is to establish once and for all whether films like Heathers, Easy A, and Mean Girls (among others) were actually quality productions--or whether there is just something so magically interesting about High School romcoms that ANYBODY with a camera and a script they recently crayoned on the back of a menu can make a successful film."
8375,"The teenager David Raskin (Jonny Weston) is a genius that dreams on joining the MIT. Each time that the teenagers interfere with the past for personal profit, the future changes and the responsible David tries to fix it. They can go back and win more lotteries any time they wanted to. They do it anyway, and use time travel to get better answers on their tests, and to get girls, win the lottery, humiliate the school bully, and get back stage passes to an Imagine Dragons gig. Teenager David Raskin (A very good Jonny Weston, an actor clearly with a good career ahead of him) is a bit of a brain box at school."
8376,"Louis CK in top form means a sage of sorts gets up on stage to expound a hilarious dharma. It's all about surprise, dismantling, abrupt leaps in narrative, rearranging walls so you can find unexpected openings to views. His successfully show on FX gives him full creative control, and while it at times is impossible to pigeonhole as to what it is, it remains an engaging show even if at times it is free of any laughs."
8377,"Brooklyn is a place of happiness and giving; Enniscorthy a place of sadness and resentment, though on Eilis' return, a fuller and more confident woman, it too offers the potential for happiness in the form of a new job and, more crucially, a new boyfriend. Director Crowley, in partnership with Oscar - nominated scribe Nick Hornby, create a beautiful and sensitive love story that is everything a Nicholas Sparks film adaptation wishes it could be. Looming skyscrapers in a distant land, the kindness of strangers, love and hope for a better life; such things open the eyes of Eilis, a smart and insular immigrant to 1950s Brooklyn, to opportunities she did not have in the Irish countryside. Combine that with the vision of John Crowley and the Oscar worthy performance by the breathtaking Saoirse Ronan, and you just have this brilliant and amazing heart warming movie. Homesick at first, she finally finds happiness with a hugely likable and very handsome Italian boy until a family tragedy forces her to return to Ireland."
8378,"Through the film, Ponsoldt is able to explore these two extremes and find common ground between them, all while touching on the idea of fame and what it means to different people. But screenwriter Donald Marguiles makes it work, and the result is an insightful, often hilarious film. Segel is a marvel as Wallace; it's a performance that doesn't demand much, yet Segel taps into all of Wallace's nuances and quirks. What this movie does have is a well written plot with fantastic dialogue, a great story, wonderful performances, and thought provoking themes that make you ponder what is really important. The End of The Tour is about the five day interview between Rolling Stone reporter David Lipsky, and acclaimed novelist David Foster Wallace (played by Jesse Eisenberg and Jason Segel)."
8379,"There are times True Story comes off as little more than a made for TV movie, but the best moments more than make up for it, and Franco's portrayal will stick with you long after Finkel finally understands who and what he is dealing with. After turning in excellent (and, to some, surprising) dramatic performances in Oscar - nominated supporting roles in Moneyball and the Wolf of Wall St., Hill, or someone in his camp, decided it was time to take a crack at a dramatic leading man role. The most compelling aspect of the film is Finkel coming to grips with the fact that he has to determining what is the truth and what is a lie. Stretching and bending the truth are common themes, as are intriguing and disturbing insights from the writers and the accused."
8380,"Scientology had a lot more members then, so there were dozens of these people wandering around, trying to look important and accomplished. What you marvel at in this documentary, which many of the participants honestly do, is that they keep swallowing the racket for years before they can bring themselves to accept that they have been swindled, in most cases of their lives, which they don't realize until their lives are lost or completely devastated. The film plays an important role in documenting the eyewitness testimony of the many inhumane abuses that occur in this organization. net) website years and years ago."
8381,"Whereas usually documentaries about comedians don't warrant bigger screen treatment as their stories can seem trivial if they don't involve social action, Tig may be a documentary that feels slight on the surface but it's able to get very heavy in the extremely personal side. It may repeat its best moments later, but they still get laughs. You come away just wishing Notaro all the best. While it's primarily a survival story, there's also a sweet love story here to enjoy with her financee Stephanie Allynne that breaks the boundaries of sexuality as she never considered herself homosexual until Tig. The doc is typically held back by its short ambitions, besides attractively composed interviews, you wish they had better footage in the verite scenes."
8382,"Through skillful use of archival audio and film, interviews and other contextual materials, and clearly with a genuine appreciation and love for the subject, Liz Garbus has found the thread that strings all of this material together; the genius and passion of a driven artist. With interviews from both herself and her closest friends and family, you also get an extremely personal look into this story. Garbus also was fortunate to have Simone's daughter's cooperation as well as her first husband and friends--giving you amazing access into Simone's world as well as into her mental illness that impacted but never destroyed her career. The documentary does a great job of telling the story of Nina Simone, though archive footage and interviews by those close to her, like her own daughter. The character in this film is, in many ways, much like Simone--with lots of brilliance as well as lots of personal demons."
8384,"Things only go from bad to worse when Marsden' enters' into the fray, the writers decide, for some reason, that Dan will do anything, literally anything to be popular and win the day. But here, he's really sank to a new low, and his career is now sitting comfortably with Cuba Gooding JRs as having the biggest career nose - dive in history. His two scenes with Black at the end of the movie; when he express his feelings about Dan; and when he apologizes; are just perfect. Jack Black has had one of the strangest careers in Hollywood for a once A-list star. This subject matter of a bromance gone to an awkward level is a welcome addition in a time where fluid sexuality is a pervasive theme within todays hot topics."
8385,"Every technical aspect, direction, soundtrack, performances gets a gold star. He is made to sell the MDMA he found in his backpack - like a drug king pin would trust someone who he had never met, and surprise surprise this is Malcolm's opportunity to screw the screwer. The movie centers on highly intelligent black high school senior Malcolm (Shameik Moore) and his two friends, multi-racial Jib (Tony Revolori) and lesbian Diggy (Kiersey Clemons). Malcolm, Jib and Diggy geek out over 1990s - era rap and hip - hop. Malcom, Jib and Diggy take the drugs to a fancy house where Dom sends them and they meet their contact's young adult children (Keith Stanfield and Chanel Iman)."
8386,"Alfonso Gomez - Rejon's film is a beautiful cocktail of wonderful things. That's probably the most beautiful part of Gomez - Rejon's direction - he never comes out and beats you with information, he leads you gently to it and makes you realise it yourself. RJ Cyler takes Earl, a generic Pedro - type sidekick and makes him just the slacker you'd expect, but with incredible qualities underneath. John Bernthal is good in everything. Nick Offerman is amazing as Greg's stay at home intellectual dad, and Molly Shannon steals every scene as Rachel's emotionally destroyed mother."
8387,"Thriving on awkward humour at the expense of new age lifestyles and anxieties, it treads a fine line of endearingly goofy, unexpectedly incisive and plain weird. His effortless cool perfectly complements Scott's nervous tension, and the scenes in which these two bond over art and their penises (both Scott and Schwartzman don prosthetic dongs in a memorable skinny dipping scene) are hilarious. Scott is great at playing the slightly neurotic everyman, and he explores his character's insecurities about his masculinity (or in Alex's words, his abnormally small dick) with his usual brand of self - deprecating charm. Schilling and GodrÃ©che offered solid performances, but their characters didn't seem as fleshed out as their male counterparts. Short and sweet, Patrick Brice's foursome mumblecore The Overnight is disguised as a more accessible comedy, headlined by Adam Scott and Jason Schwartzman along with Taylor Schilling."
8388,"Instead, he spends the next year working through his emotions, and be an even better father to his two young daughters. "" People Places Things "" is a natural story about real life people and real life events. Charmingly every - day and cynically sweet, James Strouse's People, Places, Things (2015) is a playful illustration of the struggles of heartsick, 40 - something nice - guys. People Places Things suffers from being obvious and stilted in a lot of places but it has a genuine heart at its core and a great sense of humor that makes it worth watching. A pleasantly accessible film with ample charisma and comedic talent, People, Places, Things is nothing more (or less!)"
8389,"The narrative centers around the experiment that takes place at the Stanford University in the 70's. Now the film feels and looks like the era with great costumes and set work. Since none of the study participants were actual criminals or correction officers, the idea was to glean insight into the psychology of the power imbalance that arises from the situation, as opposed to the people involved. The prisoners are "" arrested "" by actual local police officers and sent to the "" prison "" to "" await trial "". The guards initially perform their duties tentatively while there's a lot of eye - rolling by the prisoners."
8393,"There are a few nice shots showing snowy mountains, but 95% (perhaps more) of the story unfolds indoors (in one single room) - which isn't to say that the cinematography isn't absolutely fantastic. Best approach this film as you would theater; for that's what' The Hateful Eight' really is: a stage play disguised as a movie. As other reviewers have pointed out, the single positive aspect was the beautiful wide landscape and horse drawn carriage scenes. This is the first real piece of cinema that has come to the theaters this year; with all the audacity, the balls, and the fearless will to show anything on screen that real filmmakers are brave enough to commit themselves to. Hateful Eight is another Tarantino masterpiece."
8394,"Stylistically, the movie is forcefully quirky, annoyingly cutesy, and boasts a soundtrack that's like someone pushed the "" hipster "" button on a Casio Keyboard. Quentin "" Q "" Jacobsen (Nat Wolff) fell in love with Margo Roth Spiegelman (model - singer - actress Cara Delevingne) when her family moved in across the street from his. The actors are appealing and the film treats the teens like real people, but they seem abnormally worldly for their ages and their angst sometimes annoyingly plays out as nothing more than (mostly) spoiled rich white kids complaining about their lives."
8395,"Josh Gad plays the loser character, and he and Hart have great chemistry and some very funny back and forth moments. They may have defining traits, but not one of them feels like a fleshed out character. Not a masterpiece or anything but it works. A socially unpopular guy is engaged to be married with a "" hot "" woman, above his looks and status. Josh Gad and Kevin Hart bring the laughs out in this hysterical buddy comedy."
8396,"It's funny though, the movie "" The Girl Next Door "" is about a beautiful and innocent closet porn star that maybe wants to get out of the business. The attraction of "" The Boy Next Door "" is the hot Jennifer Lopez only; otherwise it would be complete garbage. If you want to have a good laugh, either with friends or by yourself, you could do worse than' THE BOY NEXT DOOR'. Although he has directed hits like "" The Fast and the Furious "" and "" xXx "" as well as above - average epics like "" Daylight, "" "" Stealth, "" and "" Alex Cross, "" Cohen appears appallingly out of his element with this formulaic fiasco. Quite honestly, the only thing that was thrilling in this film were the end credits."
8397,"Both performers do an excellent job. The film has been shot in the beautiful English countryside whose unreliable and unpredictable weather plays an integral role in the drama of untold memories, hidden emotions, and their appearance. This event as well as the approaching arrival of their 45th anniversary coerces the couple into re-evaluating their relationship, the choices they have made in life, and their deepest desires. Overall, "" 45 Years "" is an extremely simple film. Out of bed as well as in, Tom Courtenay and Charlotte Rampling give performances that make you feel every moment of their love and their pain."
8398,"As moving and well - done "" Halt auf freier Strecke "" was, as forgettable is this one here."
8399,"No 3D or any fancy stuff that movies do today can draw you into a film this much. Only really few risks were taken and some of them were pretty good E. g. "" Zeit der Kannibalen "", but for the most part they sucked. The acting in this movie is fantastic, the dialogue is actually completely improvised, so that the actors, especially the fantastic Laia Costa and Frederick Lau, become these characters in those 140 minutes and it feels real. The cinematography is brilliant, Sturla Brandth GrÃ¸vlen does a fantastic job in accompanying the main characters and even if there are some shaky parts, which was expected, its never annoying and the viewer becomes the camera. The movie has some good experimental film techniques, and the choice of making the movie in one take is a very good choice."
8403,"A good amount of these jokes wouldn't go by well in an Elementary School let alone on the big screen. And most importantly, why are these talentless hacks still making movies? Normally these spoof movies are really funny. Pitch perfect, 4G networks, climate controlled cars, etc. . They even sometimes perfectly mirror moments from the first, fourth, and fifth movies nearly perfectly."
8405,""" Focus "" blends two different movies in roughly equal measure. Focus starts relatively well, displaying many cool scenes of pickpocketing as Smith tries to lure Robbie into the business. Because if anything the majority of this film is out of focus and you can include the script in that statement as well. While it is impressive to watch, it doesn't contribute anything to the plot. HOWEVER, if you go in just expecting to be entertained and if you have a particular fondness for hustle movies, this is one enjoyable movie."
8406,""" That state of mind is revealed in the chilly winter portraits of rural Quebec in Wenders' latest film Everything Will Be Fine, his first fictional feature in almost ten years. An artistic film about everyday life focusing on the popular writer Tomas Eldan and other artists and their close - ones whose paths cross upon each other when tragedy hits, unfolding a series of events that span over a decade. The photography, both in winter and all seasons, is by BenoÃ®t Debie and the luminous musical score is by Alexandre Desplat. A small and realistic film by director Wim Wenders using brilliant 3D techniques centering around time and light that makes huge waves with the storytelling, the breathtaking cinematography and scenery with impressive performances, especially from James Franco and rising actor Robert Naylor. Over the next 12 years, he struggles to make sense of what happened and continue on with life, becoming a very successful writer who marries Ann (Marie - JosÃ©e Croze), but when he looks in the mirror, he sees a murderer."
8407,"There are a lot of negative reviews by people who don't understand the human brain. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was a surprise hit in 2012, leveraging the "" oldies "" out of their armchairs and into the cinemas in droves: the film returned around 15 times its modest $10M budget. There is interest from the owner Ty Burley (David Strathairn, probably best known as the head of Treadstone in the Bourne films) but that interest also brings the threat of a hotel inspector making Sonny (now back in India) suspicious of every new face. In terms of the acting, there is nothing like a Dame and both Dench and Smith are once again excellent, displaying nuanced and â€“ particularly in Smith's case â€“ very moving performances."
8409,"One day, he knocks into an attractive female, Nikki (Marie Avgeropoulos). The character relationships were, for the most part, believable. If you are looking for a good parkour film, you're in luck and you should be pleased overall. There is a very good amount of parkour - "" action "", so if you have any interest in this area, you should be well pleased. They were probably trying to appeal to the female, Taylor Lautner fan - crowd on the romantic aspects of the story line."
8410,"What's surprising is the plethora of fabulous performances by the kids and townspeople in this terrific little TRUE story. Special recognition to the set designers who created a beautiful location for all the running sequences. It was a rich assortment of landscapes that mesmerized the visual senses on BluRay. When he discovers that several young men in his PE class are phenomenal runners, Mr. White decides to start a cross country team at the school, bucking a skeptical principal, school board and rival teams every step of the way - not to mention straightening out the various personal and familial problems of the boys on his team (as well as coping with his own inadequacies as a father to his teenage daughter). So, while you can resist it all you want, in the end you'll probably find yourself cheering on the boys as they cross the finish line, just as you'll be championing Mr. White for his ability to lead and inspire his charges both on the field and off."
8411,"Bunch of "" nose in the air "" stiffs didn't get it, so what. Anyone can highbrow this film and put it down, but it has tangible qualities that do not make it and idiotic "" dumb & dumber "" type film. A comedy comprised of equal parts heart, brains and soul, "" Unfinished Business "" is so low - keyed and laid - back in its humor that it's practically guaranteed to get lost amidst all the crasser and flashier items that Hollywood has to offer. While Dan and his merry band of social misfits try and land a major account in Europe, Dan also faces crises back home with his overweight son and hyper - sensitive daughter who are struggling with issues of self - image and bullying. This comedy is funny in parts and the cast is well chosen."
8412,"Mobster and hit man Jimmy Conlon has one night to figure out where his loyalties lie: with his estranged son, Mike, whose life is in danger, or his longtime best friend, mob boss Shawn Maguire, who wants Mike to pay for the death of his son. When Danny turns up at Mike's house, Jimmy intervenes to save his son and ends up killing Danny, setting in motion the subsequent series of events which will see father and son move through New York City while being pursued by Danny's men â€“ including a professional assassin named Price (Common) who has his own grudge with Jimmy â€“ as well as crooked cops looking to stay on Shawn's payroll. Kinnaman doesn't get enough quiet scenes with Neeson for their father - son relationship to develop into something truly compelling, but the actors share a good rapport that give the action scenes added emotional texture. There is also the iconic Madison Square Garden, which provides the scene for a daring escape right after a Rangers - Devils game, and heightens the Big Apple atmosphere while keeping the gritty noir - ish feel of the earlier scenes. The best part of "" Run All Night "" are the steely performances by Ed Harris and Joel Kinnaman."
8413,"The costumes and attention to how people would dress in that era is flawless. The colors, the cinematography, the costumes just wow and love the music! Cinderella is a top and successful movie that had already achieved more than 335 million US$all over the world (A very clear proof that Walt Disney Pictures are the best expert in making animation and excellent movies). and again, incredible detailed costumes and sets & again great special effects, that bring the illusion of that time period to life. It's pretty, has a good cast and has some nice tid - bits of humor here and there."
8414,"Most of the positives surround Hopkins, he gives a masterclass in acting, his performance is understated and yet believable. Some of the best scenes in the movie revolve around his demands for Chinese food, books, Schubert etc, it's very random but enjoyable. To top it off, the end text credits detailing the outcomes of the various characters (which can be found on wikipedia) were more interesting than most of the movie. Anthony Hopkins lends his name and histrionic talents to uplift an otherwise pedestrian real - life crime thriller KIDNAPPING MR. HEINEKEN. Hopkins in as brief a screen time as won Judi Dench an Oscar for Shakespeare IN LOVE, easily dominates the film with his brief but pungent & idiosyncratic monologues - he gets to speak unanswered because the hooded kidnappers don't want to respond to him verbally at all."
8417,"99 (thanks iTunes for your options, btw). Although you should watch it if you're a true horror fan and you're looking for some good scares. American horror classic is all about those clichÃ© where a family moves into a new house which is hunted with a few jump scare and then the family conquer the ghost and it ends. They had some really good jump scares! particularly in the fact that they remade the movie at all, without adding anything clever to it."
8418,"Pan is a 2015 British - American fantasy adventure film directed by Joe Wright and written by Jason Fuchs, and a prequel to Scottish author J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan story, first staged in 1904. In nearly every scene, there's a hint of Pirates of Caribbean, Mad Max and multitude of classic Disney flicks."
8420,"People (and armies) showing up just at the perfect time (forgivable once, not around the 5th time). And to top it all off, the super-secret, must - be-preserved-at-all - costs message in the box, (the ENTIRE point of the movie): "" Divergents are cool, don't ostracize them. To conclude, lots of movies, even good ones, have clichÃ©s and information that you are just supposed to assume. In the first film Tris learns she is special, in the second she learns she is * very * special, but just if her boyfriend lets her do anything."
8421,Home is exactly what the less - than - 7 reviews say it is. Home started feeling like a commercial for some Rihanna album or a very long music video. BEEP BEEP BEEP Rihanna plays one of the main characters and her music is featured prominently in the movie. The lovely surprise is that the great singer Rihanna acts in it. Some movies entertain both the children and the adults.
8426,"This movies has perfectly shot, exciting, over the top - action. And that Nathalie Emmanuel, holy gasoline fumes is she gorgeous. The song choices were really good and they went along with the movie really well. fast and furious series is not made to get Oscars or golden globes these movies are made for the young people to have a thrill and bang for their money. but if you are looking for award winning performances this wont be the movie for you so critics might not like it for having the same old chase and kill concept of action movies but youth will love it because they once more saw their favorite actors do what they do best."
8428,
8432,"Get Hard is a comedy starring two of the funniest actors out there today, and having this duo of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell you would think would make for an extremely funny movie, unfortunately it doesn't but it still had its fair share of good laughs. Will Ferrell's character, James, has it all--beautiful fiancÃ©e, tons of money, lovely house. Among others, the ever - dependable Craig T. Nelson, leaves a mark. Recommended for some good belly laughs for the broad minded."
8434,Rya Kihlstedt who plays Judith gives a brilliant and totally believable performance.
8435,"Thanks to producers by these 2h unforgettable. But for most others you'll find a well executed story that portrays honor in a time when honor was everything. Clive Owen was fantastic as he usually is in these type of roles, Morgan Freeman, again one of his better movies, and the supporting cast all very well acted. There's a sizable group of talented actors and actresses in this film that give some very respectable performances. An excellent script, flawless performances where Clive Owen and Morgan Freeman join a sensational group, putting on a show."
8436,"Producer Andrew Jarecki knew how to "" feed "" the spectator with the information in the correct pace, without spoiling the upcoming revelations and lead a true investigation that enlightened things that happened 30 years ago. Almost perfectly done, this documentary series has a solid base on its impeccable research and in the interviews with Robert Durst, the man with a disturbed personality who is, at the same time, incredibly charismatic. ms / 1wz0Pnd From the cinematography alone you know you've found quality cinema and can now schedule your weeks ahead: -) It is well directed by Andrew Jarecki (Who made Capturing the Friedmans (2003). For lack of a better comparison, It's like an episode of Dateline NBC on super steroids and 10 times more interesting. On the other side you acknowledge this is actually a documentary, and the interviews from the man himself are chilling."
8437,"There are many white - knuckle scenes and heart wrenching moments that really add to the film. Many scenes in the movie are dramatic and suspenseful, but the portion of the film in which Maria and her husband escape Austria is on par with the climactic scenes in Oscar - winning films like "" Argo "" and "" The Sound of Music "". Helen Mirren delivers yet another exceptional performance and manages to pull off the snappy lines without an ounce of schmaltz, while also capturing the emotional turmoil Ms. Altmann endures. All the while her quest forces Maria to finally confront her past WWII provides a ton of stories for cinemas to depict, they will never run out of WWII materials, this one tackles the fact that thousands of artwork and paintings, that were stolen by Nazis, to this day, have never been restored to their rightful owners. Telling the young woman's life story, their hair - raising escape from Nazi occupation, and at the same time describing the red tape involved in trying to get back stolen family property by the Nazi's 50 years prior is just a stunning accomplishment."
8439,"If you want to be engagingly captivated, in a futuristic, make - believe World - where anything seems possible - then this is the film for you. The action scenes are neat and intense. The script, actors and directors captured the feeling of endless possibilities perfectly. The FX were fantastic, there were no lulls in the plot, George Clooney did his thing perfectly, the child actors were incredible, and there were just enough twists and turns to maintain the pace. This film may be centered around a fantastic utopia where anything is possible but it's more about the journey to Tomorrowland than the place itself and the build - up leading into the film's finale is second to none."
8442,"There's a part where Blart is attacked by and beats an exotic bird while a piano player nods and smiles (DUDE JUXTAPOSITION LMAO). 1 out of 10 edited by Samantha Locke twitter: @FatMikeTPK facebook page: https: / / www. until one day 2 sealed envelopes enter the Blart family's life that would change the course of their destinies forever. Now - imagine all of that - being PALED in comparison to Paul Blart Mall Cop II. A wiggling bowl of gelatin, Blart is a comic masterpiece."
8443,"This is the latest of the DisneyNature films and it retains the finest qualities of the previous features: amazing photography, stirring music, and enjoyable narration. There are crises as well as tender moments but the food hunting scenes were especially wonderful. If you are familiar with DisneyNature films, you know that the credits at the end are an integral part of enjoying the film. While the scenes of the wooded jungles are truly amazing, the mother / son relationship is truly the heart beat of the film as the family makes do with what they are given and showing just how brutal life can be amongst the predators and other dangers faced. Narrated by Tina Fey with just enough comic relief particularly in the rambunctious monkeys visiting a local town and eating everything in site including the crashing of a child's birthday party (!)"
8444,"Michiel Huisman is great in his role as a sensitive romantic who yearns to be close to and understand Adaline - well done to the writers for creating a male romantic lead who isn't unrealistically perfect and clichÃ©. The score was also wonderfully done, making the emotional scenes all the more powerful, and the costume designer did very well in allowing the audience to fill in the time blanks without knowing the era through the narrated dates. Overall, a beautifully crafted film with a wonderful story and powerful performances that will completely captivate the viewers. Through a series of fantastic phenomena, she has remained as a 29 year old for eight decades. Kreiger hearkens back to the beautiful romances of bygone eras, where subtlety and magnificent cinematography aid in delivering a beautiful romance."
8445,"During his surprise birthday party, he is given a present from his best friend and manager Frank, a letter to Danny from John Lennon, sent to that journalist, who kept it all these years, telling him that you can get rich and still remain an artist, and inviting Danny to give him a call sometime so they could talk about music. Either way, it makes you question why they chose him and not someone else for the role On the other hand, maybe knowing that the lead role is taken by Al Pacino would be enough for some people to view the movie, since this is an actor who consistently gives brilliant performances. Collins could be based on any ageing celebrity who is remembered, and still famous for having huge hits back in the day, and keeping his wealth by doing the same thing over and over and over. While staying at the Hilton, Danny tries to make right with his son Tom (Bobby Cannavale), who has gone on to marry a beautiful woman (Jennifer Garner) and lead a solid life without the help of his father, whom views him as a deadbeat, as well as win the heart of the stubborn hotel manager Mary Sinclair (Annette Bening), who shoots down every dinner request he makes."
8455,"The actors all seem to be unknowns but all do brilliant jobs of what was a very physical film in terms of what is expected. You keep watching in hope of finding out more behind the whole thing but sadly the answers are never forthcoming, which is a shame as young actor Jeremy Chabriel handles himself well despite his character of Alexander not being an overly endearing one and Vincent Cassel (a last minute replacement of Oscar Isaac) acquits himself well. Kleiman also shows enough to suggest his future endeavors could be quite the treat and the films soundtrack by Daniel Lopatin (aka Oneohtrix Point Never) is easily one of the year's best. A unique Australian backed effort with moments of genuine greatness, Partisan has wins but far far too many losses to compensate for. This is definitely an original concept, with some great acting from Cassel, Chabriel and the little boy who goes against Gregori."
8446,"It's the same as someone kind - hearted who finds joy in helping people. Lexi Ainsworth was very believable as the bullied Jessica. Now to just watch it all play out for an hour and ten minutes. Most bullies come from good families and have good lives. If people actually pay attention, bullies are mean - hearted people that love taking advantage of people."
8447,"Its story is simple and it barely covers one day in the life of the characters, but it works as an adequate frame of a genuine character study, in which even the most trivial events (like buying a coffee or taking a taxi) reveal new aspects and hidden emotions from the characters. The supporting cast is ace and includes Marcia Gay Harden, Sam Elliot, Judy Greer, Elizabeth Pena (who passed away about a year ago) and Laverne Cox (lovely to see her make the leap to feature film). Lily Tomlin is superb here starring as the acerbic Elle, a known poet and author, who's having trouble writing again after her same - sex partner, of some 38 years, passed away. Marcia Gay Harden, Judy Greer, and Sam Elliott also add well to the mix in supporting roles. com) 2015 TRIBECA FILM FESTIVAL: Paul Weitz gave the world "" About a Boy "" over a decade ago, masterfully telling a story through it character's relationships and actions."
8449,"Forget the millions of Californians who died or were dying along the way. This is a woman who has just come from living the high life of the idle rich, and let's be honest here, if you were a Search and Rescue pilot whose wife had (presumably) been shagging this mega-rich arsehole for months and was about to move into his grand house with him, a house, by the way, that you could never afford in a million years on your measly Search and Rescue pilot salary, would you go out of your way to rescue her? This is a perfect example of Hollywood, being Hollywood and should be avoided by anyone who's been hollywooded before, which is anyone watching this kind of crap over the last several decades. It's nice to see so many Californians perish as a precursor to the Great Water Wars of 2016. It's all spectacle and no substance, and the spectacle's nothing to write home about because the special effects are nothing you haven't seen before in other superior disaster movies."
8452,"If you have read Thomas Hardy's 1874 novel or seen director John Schlesinger's 1967 (and far more energetic) screen adaption starring Julie Christie, or even if you are a High School Literature student with the novel on your summer reading list, you will probably be interested in this more modern - day thinking approach from director Thomas Vinterberg (The Hunt). Just a word of warning as well for animal lovers: that despite it being a UK 12A certificate, there are some pretty torrid scenes with sheep and a dog that might upset sensitive viewers - perhaps it should have been given a "" Ewe "" certificate (that joke will only work for UK readers!) Nothing else ""), class division, complicated loves, Far offers a heroine, Bathsheba (well - cast, crooked smiling Mulligan) far ahead of her time (See the above quote). Today, 141 years later, that same question haunts Thomas Vinterberg's sumptuous, smart adaptation - one that tries valiantly, but doesn't wholly succeed, in celebrating the strength of a character that was always somewhat illusory to begin with. To their credit, Vinterberg and Nicholls do try a little harder to add a truly feminist bent to their version of Bathsheba's story."
8453,"Given he's contrasted, directly, against John Smith (Zachary Quinto) who does the exact same thing, it leaves the viewer with an interesting conundrum as to whether anything they're seeing from them is true. The action scenes are, of course, the only reason anyone should go see this movie and they don't disappoint. Agent 47 can do the John Woo guns akimbo thing with the best of them but he's also capable of taking down people with piano wire or shoving them into plane engines. Anyone who's ever harboured the dream of seeing Singapore feature prominently in a Hollywood movie will certainly be pleased with' Hitman: Agent 47 "", which features iconic landmarks such as Gardens by the Bay and Marina South in their full glory. If you want to see a decent movie about Agent 47, watch "" Hitman "", starring Timothy Olyphant."
8454,"A few references are made to Ricki being a conservative (even though she's a musician in California and her family back in the mid-West seems pretty liberal), but never gives any context for that characterization or even makes it at all pertinent to the story. This film requires an intelligent, thoughtful view to appreciate its layered look at a woman who may or may not have made the wrong choices in life, who has some regrets but accepts responsibility for herself. There are some nice side performances as well, none more so than Rick Springfield as her band made and romantic interest Greg. Streep does her usual outstanding work (not to take her for granted, but this is Meryl Streep were talking about here) â€“ and there are award - worthy performances from Streep's fellow Oscar veteran (and former co-star) Kevin Kline, definitely from Ms. Gummer, from McDonald and even from Springfield. The story felt more like a Disney Channel Movie than anything else."
8457,"Pitch Perfect was hilarious, charming, original, and had great performances. MOVIE, The funny scenes and everything was great. Pitch Perfect 2 is a 2015 American musical comedy film produced and directed by Elizabeth Banks and written by Kay Cannon. The film features an ensemble cast that includes Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Hailee Steinfeld, Brittany Snow, Alexis Knapp, Hana Mae Lee, Ester Dean, Chrissie Fit, Kelley Jakle, and Shelley Regner as The Bellas. Though the life of these Belles beyond their competitions still seems a little too pat and Tinsel Townish, their Hollywood ending on the World Stage is 100% satisfying."
8459,"Lots of lingering, carefully framed shots and closeups. Kyle Chandler's performance hasn't been commented on as much as the leads, but he was just as excellent. Nothing was overtly flashy or Normal Rockwell 50s, and at times it even felt gritty compared to most depictions of the era, but it was really beautiful. Set in the era of the McCarthy witchhunts and the post-war obsession with - one might as well call it panic about - gender roles, CAROL is based on a Patricia Highsmith novel. Playwright Phyllis Nagy's screenplay pays Highsmith the compliment of maintaining the psychological conflicts and complexities."
8460,"Co-written & directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, The Lobster marks his English - language debut and the idea & inspiration behind it is both clever & admirable. Camera movements are fluid, colour hues wonderfully compliment its overcast ambiance and lighting seems natural for the most part. Coming to the performances, The Lobster features a fine cast in Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, LÃ©a Seydoux, Ben Whishaw & John C. Reilly and most of them are simply bland & lifeless in their respective roles. So, the performances, the directing, the writing, and pretty much everything is stunning, apart from one big issue that prevents this from being a truly incredible film. The Lobster is a surreal deadpan comedy about the strangeness of social pressures and modern relationships."
8461,"Arnold Schwarzenegger's return to the big screen following his eight - year stint as the Governor of California was met with a triumphant cheer from fans of the ridiculous, over-the-top action movies that the Austrian actor helped popularize. Unlike The Walking Dead, whose characters would resolve this problem with a well - placed shot from a crossbow or pistol, the world of Maggie is much more humane. Maggie is an interesting and unique approach to a subject that is often glossed over in other zombie - related stories, and the quieter moments are the ones that resonate the most. Movie is 90 minutes long and destined to be a cult classic. As the inevitable closes in, father and daughter bond in a final, all encompassing way, before they're drawn towards a terrifying final outcome."
8462,"Plenty of gags, good laughs and even some girl on girl action which was hilarious. Most of the gags are very funny. Witherspoon uses a terrible Southern accent the whole movie, which is weird because she used a similar accent 20 years ago (Freeway) and it sounded perfectly fine. Hot Pursuit is a 2015 American action comedy film directed by Anne Fletcher and written by David Feeney and John Quaintance. If you enjoy movies like Miss Congeniality, Legally Blonde, and Spy you will definitely add this to that list of titles in your brain that you enjoyed watching with someone."
8463,"Fans of this series loved the first two movies because they were very dark and twisted. What better way then take all the prisoners and sew them ass to mouth together, right? As for the gore there are two decent scenes."
8517,"However, the grippingly honest acting of Jake Gyllenhaal definitely set this film apart from others. Gyllenhaal's performance was pretty impressive in contrast to his previous roles, however it does not save the movie from its bad writing and directing. The fight scenes were well - choreographed and executed on screen--very brutal, bloody, all with high tension. The acting was great throughout the film especially by Gyllenhaal and, surprisingly, Oona Laurence was fantastic. This was truly an acting tour de force by Gyllenhaal which simply cannot be ignored."
8464,"He still has potatoes to eat, and he still, presumably, shits occasionally, so he has all the ingredients he used the first time. In essence this is an American feel - good fantasy film, celebrating ideals of technical omnipotence, racial harmony, gender equality and international collaboration (with those cool Chinese guys and gals). A fairly standard' castaway' plot but one which offers many dramatic possibilities."
8465,"If you want psychological plots, watch Hard Candy, spare your eyes. Powerfully rich in dramatic pain and torment, rape and its aftermath had been the topic of thousands of films and TV shows."
8466,"Awesome in everything and just simply a great ride! Kung Fury started off as a fan film made by David Sandberg that got released on the YouTube as 30 min short film, but in a matter of hours it was a big hit with it's views and the amount of people loved it because they got that nostalgic 80's feel to it. It has everything as a reference: 1. It is plus size extra everything crammed into 30 minutes. A year later, David Hasselhoff True Survivor hit youtube and everyone came excited that the Hoff bought back 80's coolness."
8467,"She is supposed to be a security expert and doesn't know anything about keeping herself safe. Had a lot of expectations due to Pierce coming in as a villain and that too with a deadly look. Abbott comes with an impressive resume but despite her commendable experience in profiling terror suspects, can't seem to convince her boss and Ambassador to the UK (Angela Bassett) that certain visa applicants to the United States have diabolical motives. At best, Survivor is a film with a bunch of talented actors struggling to bring out an honorable tribute to law enforcement agencies thwarting terror attacks since 9/11."
8468,"While Kingsman was about setting up this elite organization and showing off their penchant for ridiculously elaborate action sequences, Spy has little exposition and throws you right into this hysterical world where Jude Law is the super suave secret agent and Melissa McCarthy acts as his eyes and ears back at headquarters. Melissa McCarthy's rants are hysterically funny as is her unbelievable' spy mode'! Miranda Hart and Jude Law do good with there performances though Jude feels like more of a plot device. Miranda Hart plays Cooper's goofy friend who does dumb things with the best of intentions, Rose Byrne plays the villainous daughter of a rich terrorist and has some excellent back - and - forth bickering with McCarthy, and Peter Serafinowicz plays Aldo: a sleazy Frenchman who absolutely loves women and especially their boobs. His rants are comedy gold simply because it's Statham doing them."
8469,"Much has been said about the talented lead performers, and they have done decent work in previous endeavors. Lebron James is the best thing in the movie - he's the only saving grace. It's stunning how endlessly stupid movies can be. Having said that; these kinds of movies can and have been saved by good performances. Lebron James is a big surprise."
8470,"And, the cast is stellar: Bradley Cooper, Emma Stone, John Krasinski, Alec Baldwin, Bill Murray, and so many other top performances. Rachel McAdams and John Krasinski were an amazing duo of supporting actors. There was one neat foreshadowing scene that led up to an interaction between Brian Gilcrest, played by Bradley Cooper, and Woody Woodside, played by John Krasinski. First, Rachel McAdams plays her character perfectly, and it's a well - drawn character. "" Aloha "" is quirky, often funny, sweet, and endearing, even though it's a sprawling, rambling, story with intentionally cinema - verite - flavored camera work at times."
8489,"The whole thing is so bland that the leery voice of Young Gru (Steve Carrell) right at movie's end was such a welcomed relief - at last (and alas it was the end) a little promise of inventive fun Overall this movie had potential to be hilarious but sadly with to much reliance on kid humor and the fact that Minions would work better for animated shorts on DVDs and enjoyable movie if you can turn your brain off. The Minions themselves had some funny moments which worked and helped this film. While the animation does remain the fun, hilarious and ridiculous behaviors of the characters, the theme of the scores and the nonsensical language of the minions, it does not have a strong villain to support the three, also it lacks of character development, warm emotional engagement and moral values. Original plot and storyline: This film has an original which basically starts off with the Minions evolution and basically explains more about how the Minions came along in their own funny ways as told by narrator Geoffrey Rush."
8472,"What Thornton and Osment really bring to the movie is a reality check. While the whole movie - making thing is made here a fascinating subject to tackle, the string of tepid and uninspired proceedings, robs all the interest and leaves a crumbling narrative, bereft of even the littlest of sense. It was these moments where Entourage felt more like a movie. Some of the funniest scenes come from the stress these guys put on Ari and there are a couple classic Ari outbursts. Larsen (Thornton) sends his son Travis (Osment) to Hollywood with Ari to see the movie early and to ensure it's worth putting up the extra funds, and Ari LOATHES it."
8473,"The movie had lots of promotion on TV and Disney Channel where kids mainly go to see the exciting movies coming to a theatre near them. Riley is brilliantly sympathetic throughout, even with her difficult mood swings, and the supporting characters are perfectly entertaining. The 1 star reviews are almost laughable about how inaccurate they are. Like in Snow White the emotions have names matching that of their personality. The animated design for the characters was good but seriously pixar get your stuff together you had so many classic movies that would make this look like a piece of crap e. g wall - e, Up, incredible, monster inc, monsters university, brave, toy story1 - 3, ratatouille etc."
8474,"It's at once extremely funny, with their cardboard guns and baggy suits, yet haunting in the same sense. Without internet and with plenty of time on their hands, they compiled homemade scripts of their most treasured films (which range from "" The Dark Knight "" to "" Gone With the Wind ""). This film inspires the big dreamers; those who are looking to break their shackles. The boys spend considerable time re-enacting the contents of their favourite movies using home - made props and make - up. The story of their lives is incredibly gripping, and absolutely worthy of this skillfully - made film."
8476,"This is definitely the case with Mockingjay Part 2, the thrilling and emotional conclusion of the franchise. Jennifer Lawrence returns, for one last time, as Katniss Everdeen, the main protagonist. In Mockingjay Part 1, Katniss is suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and is finding it difficult to cope without Peeta Mellark, her former tribute and love interest from District 12, as she doesn't know if he's dead or alive. She is perfect as Katniss and really understands her character well. In The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, Peeta had a charming and sweet personality but in this film, he's lost that charm due to the Capitol torturing him."
8477,"Pixels has a very good concept and story idea about a movie that is about classic video games but it fails very badly to be a good movie. The only positive thing about the movie Pixels is some Visual shots and effects of those old classic arcade games and the performance of Peter Dinklage is good to certain points. Some gaming characters like Pac Man looks good in 3D and some 3D Visual scenes are interesting. It was very creative and it brought back memories of older games such as PAC - MAN, Galaga, and Donkey Kong. But the two who were just hilarious and almost made you cry because they were so funny was Peter Dinklage and Josh Gad."
8456,"This film borrows a lot from classic sci fi horror movies, you get some of the tech from alien, a little bit of Event Horizon, and has the claustrophobia of The Thing. The movie has all ingredients to entertain, a good dialogue script, a very unique and an engaging plot, a proper ending, well portrayed expressions from all the actors. Its good to see Australia producing quality flicks and Infini is certainly a competent sci fi. This film has room to evolve and expand but with such little funding, its hard to see these ideals becoming reality. ' Infini' the independent Australian film made on low budget with most, maybe all of its actors doing their roles for free is an entertaining chunk of screen that has no shortages of head f@cks."
8490,"There's just something so genuine and beautiful about their movies, not to mention the endless amount of lessons one can learn. It is a simple film, but the subtle messages, such as overcoming your fears, the importance of family, and making your mark were heartwarming, and make you think, a lot! They did a tremendous job of capturing the beauty of nature, from forests to prairies, and interposing an almost cheesy - looking dinosaur in the midst of it was fantastic. Frances McDormand is especially wonderful as the mother of the simple farming family of apatosaurs, and the characters are driven by simple values like family and hard - work. It's the core of the emotional artistry that movies are meant to be."
8482,"Robert (Ferrell) and Sarah (Wiig) are happily married and expecting a new baby. Kristin Wiig is actually a very good straight actor but if she's really going legitimate here, she can't overcome what she has to work with. After much speculation it turned out the movie wasn't at all a comedy / parody, although some moments could've been interpreted in a funny way (the garage door opening being one of them), it is actually a Lifetime tribute with essential elements of their movies that have been popular with its audience: a life - altering accident, a fresh start after couple of months / years (it occurs twice in perfect sync at the beginning and ending of the movie), alcoholic husband, naive partner / wife, dark past that gets everyone in trouble, a crazy ex-lover, best friend who knows too much for his own good, phone that stops working in a crucial moment, police getting involved all too late, saving the day ending and lets not forget the classic handgun shooting happening between almost all characters in a row. For non-lifetime viewers this will be a new and enjoyable experience which they could find funny in some scenes given the 2 comedy Gods involved in it, but you need to have seen at least 1 Lifetime movie to understand the replicated elements that are included in this anniversary. The funny thing is, because Ferrell and Wiig and co-star Jessica Lowdnes play everything completely straight - and Ferrell and Wiig are better actors than a Lifetime movie should ever deserve - and it's all believable, sometimes verging on maybe, kinda, sorta being dramatic in a * good * way."
8483,"He becomes aware of a very expensive and very secretive process by which his consciousness can be implanted into a younger man's body, enabling Damian to survive, enjoy life and contribute to society for another 50 years or so. A welcome treat among so many scripts that tend to walk the line of "" the ridiculously over the top . "" Essentially like John Frankenheimer's classic' Seconds', this film is still a merrymaking Thriller with enough twist and turns to make everything intriguing. This is an original, exciting film that is very well - acted, well - paced (by director Tarsem Singh) and well - plotted (by screenwriters David and Alex Pastor). It does have some good action scenes, and great sci - fi element."
8484,"Besides short segments taking place in the Middle Ages and another on a plane, this supernatural flick takes place in modern New York. One of the neatest places was that bar with the subtle light magic. Surrounding the more - emotional - than - usual Diesel, there's actually a pretty decent cast including Michael Caine (always classy), Elijah Wood (amusing and solid) and Rose Leslie, that redhead wild woman from Game of Thrones. Same is true with any other sort of comics, the only important thing is that you can always create a new sequel, a new episode. Considering all that, TLWH, is doing it's job very nicely."
8488,"But even the degree of laughs suffers the same problem; it's full of energy at first then it awkwardly mutes its lighter tone for its climax. The first half really has the strongest amount of funny moments and also brought some intrigue to the story's center. Even for a comedy that is actually just fooling around, it stills displays a mind of uncertainty. Predictably raunchy, pot fueled and consists pop culture references; that will certainly be enjoyed if you understand the language of a Seth MacFarlane comedy. The performances from its lead actors are still a joy to watch."
8491,"' Black Mass' has the look of a 70s television show, and that works in its favor. As an adaptation of the best - selling book of the same name by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill, the film portrays the key years of Bulger's ascent to power in the Boston crime world, during which he acted as an FBI - informant through slick FBI agent (and Southie homeboy) John Connolly (Joel Edgerton). Despite a great cast and some interestingly insane source material, somehow a movie about one of America's most infamous criminals feels more like small claims court. It's a grimy yet quiet 70's - feel gangster film that engages its audience nearly as much as it reminds them of better films."
8492,"Nicely played by Daniel Craig, this is his fourth entry, first was Casino Royale, following Quantum of solace and Skyfall. Sam Mendes and John Logan apparently came to the conclusion that it was time to bring back one of the most crucial ingredients for Bond's success with audiences over the years: the fun. Following the magnificent Skyfall, Spectre had some huge shoes to fill, and for the most part, it delivers exactly what you'd expect. Casino Royale is one of the greatest action thrillers ever, let alone Bond movie, and Skyfall is right up there with Goldeneye as a quintessential Bond adventure. All the interesting plot developments from Casino Royale and (and even Quantum of Solace to some extent), such as Bond's emotional state after losing Vesper and the Quantum organization, are chucked out the window."
8493,"The c. g. is bad, the story is ridiculous, the acting is cheesy but the movie is fun. Cheers and remember life won't suck as long as there is a good B movie to watch. Frankie Muniz, Ryan Newman, David Hasselhoff, Mark Cuban and Bo Derek join the cast; which also has returning cameos from Matt Lauer and Al Roker, plus many new ones (including notorious conservatives like Ann Coulter and Michele Bachmann). While Fin (Ziering) is receiving an award from the president (Cuban), in Washington, D. C., for saving Los Angeles and New York from sharknados, in the first two films, another sharknado hits the capital. The story of Sharknado is a rather interesting turn of fate."
8497,"The scene towards the middle of the film where Sculley and Jobs have it out is a work of art in itself of dialogue, editing, and acting, and the time shifting between the present and various pasts of their relationship is expertly done. The first act consists of having Jobs working for Apple as a member of an Macintosh R and D group and whose company is about to release the new computer called Macintosh in 1984. The final act consists of Jobs now again back at Apple working as the CEO and whose company is to release a new computer called iMac in 1998. At the center of it all is his relationship with his daughter Lisa whom he first refused to acknowledge when he had early success in life; later reconnected with her during the humbling moments of his life; and finally formed a father - and - daughter relationship when he found a renewed success when he got back to his former company. ' Steve Jobs' is another fine example of his talents."
8499,"there is plot twists everywhere, but the movie is for some reason able to keep you entertained as you try to pick up all the popcorn you dropped on the floor after laughing hysterically from a really bad line that just turns even more awkward as the other character replies back. Also many jokes throughout the credits, that will either delight you or annoy you more - depending on how you liked the movie If you love raunchy and dirty humor and you loved the original Vacation movies, then you will love and enjoy this comedy film. It actually holds fairly true, given the 30 years. There are several scenes which pay homage to the original Vacation movie which was great to see."
8556,"And there are some really good scenes with zombies and police officers and you can see how the disease spreads so easily. It does somewhat turn into the typical Zombie movie, shocks, gore, cops etc, but it's worth watching."
8503,"Rosaria had moved to a new job in Florida. Delineation of conflicts: The reception in Baton Rouge was lovely. Well depending on how you liked the first two movies, you can expect to feel the same here. If you haven't seen the last two films (Bad Ass and Bad Asses) you most likely won't enjoy this film. If you enjoy action movies, then "" Bad Asses on the Bayou "" is hardly the first of choices to go to."
8505,"It is a very honest and emotional movie with personal clips that show her rise to fame and her feelings about it. "" Amy "" The Amy Winehouse Documentary is brilliant. And the press, who relentlessly haunted her and enjoyed every misstep in her life. Apart from providing a stunning insight in Winehouse's short life and career,' Amy' is also a great movie from a cinematographic perspective. It's absolutely incredible what the film makers (with the help of the Winehouse family) have unearthed."
8507,"They all agree that rehearsing and performing in thongs was a true bro boding experience and make fun of their junk and blah blah blah. While driving home after seeing the stud dud, Magic Mike XXL, the radio station began playing You Gotta Have a Gimmick from Gypsy, that classic show - tune about strippers. Strange it is to pay seven to ten dollars to see a movie about male strippers--and none of them even remove their tee shirts until a so - called "" grand finale "" at the end. well, it was a grueling hour and 55 minutes sitting through it. The sordidness of male strippers is on the back burner as this film version celebrates the legitimacy of male dancers as a serious art form."
8509,"It perfectly rides the fine line between straight 1960s spy movie throwback, and satire of one. Villain is pure 1960s vamp / femme fatale, Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer's chemistry alone makes this worth watching. The star of the show is undoubtedly the director, Guy Ritchie and like most film buffs, was more curious than excited about U. N. C. L. E.'s arrival. Guy Ritchie's trademark is everywhere on this film, from the stylish sets, to the retro fashion. It was an entertaining, fun ride that engrossed the audience from start to finish with enough action to keep the doubters glued to the screen."
8510,"Andy Samberg was especially really funny, as were all the actors. Samberg and Harrington are great in the lead roles. The scenes in Swedish are quite fun, as the Swedish actor actually says his lines in Swedish, while Samberg channels the Swedish chef from the muppets show. the others like Will Forte, Fred Armisen and of course that leading stars Andy Samberg and Kit Harington were really funny. It often does rely on shock value for its laughs, and the writing does feel a bit sloppy at times."
8511,"Robert Zemeckis' signature visual style and proclivity for bio-pics seemed perfect for a movie like The Walk, a film that manages to boast an interesting and entertaining story and dizzying cinematography. The Walk is a 2015 American 3D biographical drama film directed by Robert Zemeckis and written by Christopher Browne and Zemeckis. This certainly takes away the potential emotional and cinematic impact longer, narration - free scenes would've had on audiences but it served the purpose of moving the story forward swiftly. Two examples from recent cinematic history come to mind. This is truly a movie to behold in IMAX 3D and one will come out of the theater feeling immensely satisfied with the experience."
8513,"Spend your time and money on other films, like' It Follows' which came out this year a way better psychological horror or even Insidious 3 where they have much better intense moments."
8516,"But it's far from his best, although his work - ethic is remarkable, along with the fact that he isn't guilty of missing the mark or making poor movies, even when he's coasting. Joaquin Phoenix is still one of the best an most interesting actors working today, and Emma Stone, who is just getting better and better is one of the most enjoyable actresses to watch just now. Similar to the Hitchcock classic, Strangers on a Train (especially in plot), The movie gives a very interesting take on the perfect crime. Questions and ideas are posed without enough attached to them, although the stakes may be high, the narrative is familiar and one could expect Jessica Fletcher or Columbo to be involved in such a story. That being so, it's even interesting to think about people's reactions when a new one of his movies is released."
8518,"You are always on the edge of your seat and in some occasions you are really biting your knuckles. It is so in you face, so tight, it really contributes in making you feel a part of this even in the more intimate scenes. The characters are really what holds the film together, they are truly developed three dimensionally and explored in depths that aren't normally reached. You are certainly left with something to think about because of the themes, the characters, the atmosphere and the intensity, but all in all the plot doesn't offer interesting turns and not enough moral questioning, unlike "" Prisoners "", and so remains slightly one - note for the whole duration. it's very understated with a lot of it consisting of looks."
8519,"' Best of Enemies' is more than nostalgia, it is a palimpsest for the soul of the American soul. Now the genie has been loosed from the bottle, and he has truly been feeling his oats for the past several years. But, in' Best of Enemies' trans - political make over is a glint in Buckley's eye as he faced the talented Gore Vidal as they' commented' on the 1968 Republican convention in Miami and then the Democratic convention in Daley's Chicago. Best of Enemies analyzes the antagonistic relationship between Buckley and Vidal as they debate the issues of the day. These debates are chronicled in the powerful documentary Best of Enemies directed by Robert Gordon ("" Johnny Cash's America "") and Morgan Neville ("" Twenty Feet From Stardom "")."
8520,"It's upsetting, certainly, but Anomalisa offers a real insight into the human soul and makes a lasting impression. The look of the movie and the puppets is fantastic, and Carter Burwell provides yet another spot - on score. But it isn't until he finally hears a different voice in the form of Lisa Hesselman (Jennifer Jason Leigh) that he finally awakens to life and all of its wondrous possibilities. There are good scenes, and ideas worth considering, but absolutely not enough of them for a feature. It's a clever, albeit potentially confusing, means of conveying the sameness with which Michael views everyone around him, which is heightened by the fact that all the faces on the puppets playing the other characters are oddly similar, as well."
8522,"The supporting cast supports wonderfully, giving the stars plenty of room to shine, not distracting from the story. It's hard to find a movie that is respectable and clean, with charm and wit, one that is suitable for thinking adults. Anne Hathaway does a fine turn as the Internet entrepreneur, and fleshes out well what could have been a cartoon character of the Ãœbermom. Subtle, believable performances that did not pander to the problems of aging, but acknowledged them. The movie was surprisingly quite funny; didn't know anything about it before viewing."
8523,"She makes an interesting character: her style of speaking has its similarities to that of evangelical preachers, although she appears completely genuine in her message combining self - forgiveness and practical help. it is admirable that activists should attempt to offer them ways out, that much may be said for even the odious Catharine Mackinnon. The women running the program - ex prostitutes - are doing the best they can to rescue some of the victims and to prevent children from descending into this hellish lifestyle."
8524,"There is a strong supporting cast including performances such as Joan Allen's role as Jack's loving Grandma and the ever convincing all - star William H Macy as a resistant Grandpa who is having difficulty accepting that his daughter is raising her rapist's son. Room is deserving of an Oscar nomination for best picture and nominations in a few other categories as well such as best actress, best actor and best director. He gets a birthday cake from his mother (but no candles); a visit from his father; and a gift, albeit belatedly. This is an absorbing, although slow - moving, film that builds to some truly nail - biting moments. Jacob Tremblay is also exceptional as Jack - and it would be nice (rather than try to compare young performances with adult ones, as per Anna Paquin) if there was a special awards category for actors and actresses under 10."
8525,"Get an idea of what politicians have to be like if they want be honest vs if they want to be successful. Also, it's a pretty precise sketch of not only how how the politics work, but also how a lot of relationships work. This will lead to Pryce's return to drinking after being sober for 16 years, as well as sparking divorce papers from his high powered and ambitious wife Deborah (Connie Nielsen)."
8526,"Like the best thrillers, The Gift evolves naturally and realistically. The Gift is a surprisingly well - crafted and intense thriller film that feels like a throwback to the best 90's stalker flicks. Bateman delivers a career best performance, ditching his recent string of light comedies and applying his condescending attitude towards the yuppie entitlement in Simon. Joel Edgerton also proves extremely eerie as Gordo and for someone to pull off the perfect trifecta such as Edgerton, it puts him in the same league as Ben Affleck. The three leads are also so fantastic."
8528,"While Game of Thrones alumni Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie offer brilliantly raw performances as the family's mother and father, it's the film's younger actors â€” Harvey Scrimshaw and Anya Taylor - Joy â€” who really shine. The story is mediated through phenomenal performances that are the real emotional center of the film, while rare but fantastical occurrences with the supernatural jar the audience as much they do the family. The family's dealings with the supernatural terror in the woods push their spiritual and physical endurance to the breaking point. The lingering atmosphere is done incredibly well from the beginning, helped along by a combination of a tense score and the use of extended periods of silence. The performances are explosive, the tension is gut - wrenching, and the settings are nightmarish."
8529,"This is not a cgi crap action so called horror thing for teens, this is a classic old school horror, it's filled with a creepy atmosphere and uses perfectly all the ideas for each character to keep the viewer feeling uncomfortable all the time. Besides the trademark Shyamalan twist, which actually works here and seems reasonable in hindsight (unlike, say, The Village), the extremely self - aware script and the very natural and authentic brother - sister relationship between both co-leads, lends further credence to Shyamlan's pet project. This is clearly an horror movie for adults, its not edited at two hundred frames per second and it has a classic structure that simply is not targeted at young audiences. Credit must be given to Shyamalan who manages to get great performances from his actors, a welcome change after the stilted and wooden performances in his last few films. His recent talk in interviews about gaining back artistic control of his products was another positive step in Shyamalan's long path to cinematic forgiveness."
8530,"The design is extremely stylish and even nobly unique, but underneath those flairs of fun is one of the most identity - confused films ever, a true mess of genres and tones that never quite finds its footing. At both times absurdly funny and oddly sincere, all the performers seem to be in different movies."
8531,"STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is getting very, very high reviews from the vast majority of IMDb reviewers--but the nine and ten - star reviews are all getting pelted with "" negative "" marks, earning scores of "" 1 out of 15 "" likes. Quick, let's bury the good reviews! From PUBLIC ENEMY to THE GODFATHER, white audiences have always loved to sentimentalize their own criminals. Ignore all the 1 - star reviews because the people posting them are total losers. GREAT MOVIE, if you like N. W. A, it is really worth your while, and if you are not, it is still worth a watch just because of the really intriguing true story that "" Straight Out Of Compton "" is."
8532,"Fourthly, it's a rather well photographed and scored affair, with the sparse Colorado plains scenery shot nicely in widescreen. Examples of standout real - time films would include Tom Cruise (amazing) in COLLATERAL; Dennis Weaver in DUEL; and the Canadian sci - fi epic, CUBE. So now that you know first - rate films CAN potentially be made using the technique, the writer / director of this film (to be kind) did not set his sights quite that high. Director / writer: Jon Watts and writer: Christopher D. Ford have smartly kept the dialog minimal and the setting vast and expansive. In doing this the viewer must concentrate solely on and only on the main characters - Kretzer, Travis & Harrison."
8544,"Sin - Dee (Kiki Kitana Rodriguez) and Alexandra (Mya Taylor) are opposite personality types, but clearly good friends as they chat while splitting a donut in the opening scene. However, the exciting thing is that the story pays little attention to the vocation of Sin - Dee and Alexandra, and is more a story of friendship, heartbreak, and the sub-cultures that make up a particular community of the L. A. area. The film also breaks tradition in the casting department by employing two transgender actresses in the given roles & both of them deliver fantastic performances, with Mya Taylor playing her character in a balanced manner while Kitana Kiki Rodrigues going full crazy as Sin - Dee. Written & directed by Sean S. Baker, Tangerine is crafted with rigour & passion and shatters many filmmaking norms over the course of its runtime. The music is cutting edge street sound that propels you along the LA sidewalks and, combined with the colors of the film (i. e. tangerine), it pulls you into the brash and jolting life on some of the worse streets of LA."
8607,"The skeptic type, based on rational and logical analysis of all the evidence and framings towards Steven Avery and Brenden Dassen making them not guilty (attributing around 10/10 rating). This is one of the best documentaries ever created and a must - watch for everybody. You will find two major types of reviews in here: 1."
8548,"a tale that graphically illustrates how much the world has really changed, and changed for the better, in a mere hundred years. There are moments of humour in the grim struggle, but this movie brings to life vividly and touchingly the high price paid by some women to obtain the right to vote for all women. Helena Bonham Carter is quite surprisingly good as Edith Ellyn, especially in a sequence where she and her co - conspirators plan to blow up a private property constructed for Lloyd George's personal pleasure. Even lovely Ben Whishaw was nasty. Years ago the BBC did a series SHOULDER TO SHOULDER (1974) that told the story of the origins and development of the Women's Movement in Britain, with special attention paid to the WSPU (Women's Social and Political Union)."
8549,""" War Room "" is the story of Tony (T. C. Stallings, who with his razor sharp features and V - shaped brow is a bit too scary to pass as an everyman), his wife Elizabeth (Priscilla Shirer), and their daughter, Danielle. A comfortable middle - class black family have some first world problems, and turn to the Bible - belt version of Christianity to solve them. The production, story and acting are all as good, if not better than, any other movie you'd expect to see in the theaters. Unlike many Christian themed movies on television, which are lacking in many ways, this movie is well worth watching. Sharper than any double - edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart."
8550,"Tom Hardy delivers everything expected from him, from the subtle or strong expression, change of speech and mannerism to intricate body language of different characters. The story of the Kray twins is a fascinating one, full of violence and deceit. The supporting cast, including Taron Egerton and Christopher Eccleston, also do a fine job though Ecclestone's police officer almost gets ignored completely. Also worthy of mention is the portrayal by David Thewlis (Lupin from the Potter films) of the Kray's financial adviser Leslie Payne: a man who knows he has the financial respect of the twins (at least Reggie) but is always sailing a dangerous course between kowtowing to them and criticizing their actions. Written and directed by Brian Helgeland ("" Payback ""), this is an intelligent British thriller, reflecting a visceral view of the criminal underworld of London in the' 60's."
8551,"The Demons resemble Deadites from Evil Dead 2, which this movie clearly pays homage to among other several horror movies (most notable, Braindead). Directed by Jason Lei Howden, who clearly knows his music and his horror, Deathgasm owes a lot to the splatter classics of Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson, his film possessing a similarly energetic and madcap style. The lead actor plays it perfectly, and is well backed by the cast (apart from the cousin), and the gags are packed in. The funniest thing about New Zealand movies is that pretty much all cast and crew members previously worked on most of the Lord of the Ring movies, either as extras or as visual effects people. you have "" Deathgasm "", a movie that is both dark and hilarious, with over-the-top gore and some questionable sexual references (but never offensive, just uproarious)."
8552,"Based on a true story, Oscar - winner Eddie Redmayne ("" The Theory of Everything "") and Alicia Vikander ("" Ex Machina "") play a bohemian married couple Einar and Gerda Wegener, apparently happily married and trying for a child in 1920's Copenhagen. THE DANISH GIRL isn't a masterpiece but it's certainly a very good movie with some excellent performances. The Danish Girl (2015) *** (out of 4) The semi true - story of painters Einar (Eddie Redmayne) and Gerda Wegener (Alicia Vikander), a married couple who find their lives changing when Einar dresses as a woman so Gerda can have someone to paint but it brings something out in him. Performance-Wise: Eddie Redmayne as Lili Elbe & Alicia Vikander as Gerda Wegener, deliver brilliant performances. Eddie Redmayne is surely up for another Oscar - nomination for his brave performance as Einar / Lili, using his expressive eyes to great effect and delivering a truly heart - rending performance."
8553,"This isn't a scary due to monsters and ghouls though, it's scary because of how realistic and effective the violence is to where it really sticks with you. The performances of the movie is also great, Anton Yelchin and Imogen Poots did a wonderful job, and so is the rest, except Patrick Stewart. Saulnier does such an amazing job on capturing the brutal intensity of each moment as the characters desperately battle their way through a violent bloodbath against a gang of white supremacists that threaten their young lives, and the camera work done by Sean Porter makes for great use to capture these dreadful moments. A good horror / thriller movie should pace out their kills, not kill two people in two minutes, and then make you wait thirty or so more minutes for the next death. Just as deserving is definitely the make up department which has a couple of really key moments that hit the viewer like a brick and contribute in giving a sense of anxiety and fear that once again is appended to the audience for the whole duration."
8555,"At that point, it's easy to forget the delights of the first ten minutes as Abraham Attah's Agu playfully hustles his living, selling shells of television sets with his friends. Abraham Attah's performance as a young boy who has clearly been through hell is of course integral to making that emotion clear, but the inventive and beautiful directing really aggrandises that feeling of total despair and loss of innocence, which is why this film is just such an incredible one to watch. There are times when Agu could simply point a gun at the commandant and be done with it, but there's a humanity to the film that respects all lives. However, even Idris Elba is outshone by the stunning performance given by the young Abraham Attah, who plays Agu. Abraham Attah is amazing and has one of the best child actor performances ever!"
8560,"Seth Rogen is a rather intelligent producer. Yet there are a lot to be desired and a major part of the film, although uneven, takes the lead and makes lifelong friendship to seem like it is just an excuse for some crude jokes like blood from a dripping nose into someone's drink or vomiting into a church during Xmas mass. seth rogen is, well, seth rogan. Why can't anyone actually articulate anything beyond the most basic grunting sounds? It re-teams Rogen with Joseph Gordon - Levitt and director Jonathan Levine (the trio last worked together on 2011's' 50/50')."
8561,"A poet once wrote, "" You can join the millions talking in the dark. because by the time the credits roll and you start to breathe normally again, you will suddenly realize that this was not a horror film as such, this was a re-enactment of events that actually happened, with real victims and real perpetrators and real well - meaning third parties covering up the whole thing as fast as the body count kept piling up. Ruffalo gives the performance of his career, Keaton is solid as a rock, and McAdams reaps overdue dividends from her decision to broaden her career into non-glamorous roles at a time when the only scripts they were sending her were for Diva parts. He makes brilliant artistic choices, such as letting a Mark Ruffalo letter reading play over a 2 - minute taxi car ride back to the newspaper. All the players performing are top - notch but walking away, best - in - show, is the performance of Academy Award nominee Mark Ruffalo."
8563,"The pace of the film is right and there are some great natural performances especially from the chameleon actress Sienna Miller and the always serious Daniel "" Nikki Lauda "" BrÃ¼hl. Shot at a whirlwind running time of just over 100 minutes, Burnt registers former drug addict / cooking aficionado, Adam Jones (Cooper). It's very nicely acted, especially by Sienna Miller who is becoming one of hardest to recognize people in movies these days - she is always looks and sounds different - she might pick up Oscar nomination one day (not for this movie though). "" Burnt "" (2015) is another very solid movie in so called "" food movies "" like "" Chef "" (2014) - there aren't many of them, both loved them both. If you like these kind of movies, you will probably enjoy this picture as well."
8564,"The message about to change and to adapt in order to fit oneself into a new environment is well simplified to cater children's understanding while the eye popping, colorful visual effects together with pop styles emerging into the story are well crafted to make young adults feel like kids. Considering his past work being on projects like Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs (2009) and Arthur Christmas (2011), Hawkins feels like a great collaborator for Tartakovsky's vision. The voice acting was stunning and honestly this lovely film is worth seeing for all ages, you will move into another fantastic world for 90 minutes. People were looking for a real comedy that would make them forget their own problems and the movie was absolutely hilarious from the beginning till the end. There's something about Tartakovsky's vision of cartoons that breathes life into every movement that is made by them."
8565,"Imagine a future, where the majority of citizens are not only using, but encouraged to do so though advertising and product guarantees. Hate being hard on a movie - regardless of budget, it is still someone's creative sweat equity - but this is a real stinker But if you are suffering from insomnia. Serious' Hard' Science Fiction, well done, beautifully conceptualized. The boy is particularly good in his role, and although not really having much experience in heavy duty acting, he really did an outstanding job, especially in his scenes with his screen Dad."
8566,"8/10 - Because the movie has heart, with a hint of attitude, yet doesn't trip over itself with the spy angle like most of these kinds of films would. Emma Roberts and Sara Silverman do excellent jobs in their supporting roles, while Mickey Rourke steals pretty much every scene he is in. Ashby needs a driver, and the two strike an amiable enough relationship that's both tragically funny and a sly statement on the addled nature of youths today. Rourke's cowboy machismo and brooding vibe of danger is genius and takes on a whole new light when contrasted with the bright, idiosyncratic realm of the low key indie dramedy. It's a perfect concoction of ingredients, a melding of today's millennial teen angst with the battle scarred remnants of 1990's gritty pulp fare."
8568,"Obviously a little bit embellished for Hollywood's sake, Bridge of Spies does a fine job as a historical docudrama. But thrill - seekers, you're better off to see the new James Bond movie instead. Munich captures the violence of the Middle East 70s with revere, respect, and revelation. Spielberg's story is a moral tale â€“ of courage and standing up for one's ideals â€“ the universal plot which Steven devours like a hungry child. In the final analysis, it's a buddy film with some period costumes and a somewhat poignant conclusion."
8569,"Just sit back and relax its a great film, there are worse things to do with your time for ninety minutes. He very rarely takes the lead in movies, but he definitely makes his presence known with his unique acting style and dashing smile, which is mentioned in Anchorman 2. The location scenery and setting is fantastic, and there's some grizzly scenes (no pun intended) of hard to watch dead bear cubs, body dismemberment and so on. The acting was good, especially from James Marsden, Piper Perablo and Billy Bob Thornton."
8570,"Suspicion gets bigger but none of the guests seem to care about anything. Despite some reminiscence (group of friends, dinner, the house atmosphere, colors) with "" Coherence "" is undoubtedly an original movie. A very interesting point made by the director (who had already done Girlfight and Jennifer's Body) over a possible processing of the pain of a loss, in a quite denying way, perhaps cynical, reaching extremes of aggressiveness. Which, instead of being sprung on you hoping to leave a lasting impression, is instead gradually introduced so that 30 seconds later the big reveal is now a tepid event that you caught onto 28 seconds ago, 29 if somehow your brain hadn't turned off before that and taken the extra second to wake up."
8572,"Goosebumps is a fun, family friendly movie. The actors do a decent job throughout, and Jack Black really excels as R. L. Stine. The special effects are very well done, and the monsters look real. "" Stephen King is no slouch, "" commented a member of the Movie Fan Facebook Page staff. Beyond that, you may be surprised to learn that Stine has bested the famously prolific King by publishing hundreds of books, which have sold over 400 million copies!"
8573,"The actor mix is perfect and, even though some parts are predictable, you will definitely enjoy the movie. Watch till the end, nice twists. The film focuses on Leah Vaughn (Sanaa Lathan), a successful woman working in corporate America, who has been building an equally successful relationship with her boyfriend David (Morris Chestnut). As a result, Carter makes numerous advances towards Leah, taking no for an answer each time, resorting to following her and calling her throughout the day. Also very talented but unlikely to share what little acclaim this film will find is McCallany, whose serious and even - tempered demeanor work wonders when paired with Lathan in the film's later scenes."
8574,"Films like the quite watchable The Burrowers (2008) and Dead Birds (2004) have mixed those ingredients before with some success, but while those two were undoubtedly B - movies, Bone Tomahawk never feels like your typical straight to VOD genre film. This is a film that is willing to spend a very considerable part of its running time just building atmosphere and exploring the different characters, and the action / horror moments are actually few and far between. In spite of its tiny budget, this is a quality film that really should have had a wide theatrical release; everything from the A-list cast to the excellent cinematography, sound and production design practically scream for the big screen. But if you like old - school Westerns with great characters (played by great character actors), great atmosphere and deadpan humour, and you ALSO don't mind (very!) 5/10 A rock - solid western in the beginning, Bone Tomahawk transforms midway to become one of the most gruesome horror movies this year."
8575,"Everyone else will highly appreciate the original story, the excellent camera work and set design, the abundance of love shown in every frame for a project that took 15 years to realize. This is easily the best cast ever assembled for an Australian feature; from stand up comedians to TV icons, to stage and screen legends; and new talent. Liam Hemsworth is suitably the movie matinÃ©e idol; with his piercing blue eyes, his tall, muscular frame and that true blue Aussie drawl. Hugo Weaving is fantastic as always - several laugh out loud moments with him. The dialogue flurries and stubborn, though endearing, rapport constantly firing between Kate Winslet and Judy Davies are exceptional and certainly to be applauded."
8577,"The film Concussion describes the incredible journey by Nigerian Dr. Bennet Omalu (wonderfully played by Will Smith) who uncovered a shocking revelation about the damaging effects football collisions have on its players. Set in Pittsburgh after the deaths of several star former Steeler players most notable that being hall of fame center Mike Webster (in a gritty performance from David Morse) who due to many hits to the head developed all kinds of problems like hearing voices, and loss of reality as he even had to live away from his family taking shelter in his own truck before falling to suicide by a head gunshot wound. While, it's true that the neurosurgeon did deny any relationship between football concussions and Omalu's findings. Instead of focusing on compelling athletes competing in a physical game. Football is a great sport but their can be serious life consequences that can come from it."
8578,"It has captured the magic of Peanuts. Over the past six decades, Peanuts had leapt from its comic strip medium and into the form of animated TV shows, holiday specials, and even a few movies, but rendering these well - known characters into CGI in this new animated feature turned out to be unique in its own right because it's basically channeling the essence of Schulz's original designs and humor that the older generation had gotten to know so well. Thankfully, it appears that the people behind "" The Peanuts Movie "" take the legacy of these characters very seriously, and the result is a gentle, charming movie that seems far less frantic than much of what is created for young audiences these days. Frequently very funny, undeniably aimed at younger audiences, and true to the source material, "" The Peanuts Movie "" is too mild - mannered to win over brand new audiences, but it's going to please people who were already fond of the underlying property, and it should be a big nostalgia - driven hit for the studio. In summary, The Peanuts Movie is a wonderful tribute to the comic strip and the animated specials produced by Lee Mendelson and Bill Melendez whose vintage voice tracks as Snoopy and Woodstock were provided here as well."
8579,"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (2006) made a lasting impression to be sure, but Wolf Children (2012) remains in this writer's mind one of the most insightful and sublime anime films ever. It rivals the delicate balancing of themes that make Ghibli Studios so popular yet instead of children's stories, Hosoda dabbles in adult themes making Hosoda more of a contemporary to the late Satochi Kon. The Boy and the Beast continues the animator's winning streak providing a soulful coming - of - age tale through killer action sequences and clever thematic liberties. Inadvertently, he's entangled in a feud between two powerful warriors vying for Lord of Jutengai. The first is Iozen (Yamaji / Hennigan), a wise and popular swordsman who fathers two children and apprentices many talented disciples."
8581,"All in all this is a really good coming of age story and LGBT movie. Definitely worth checking out if your into movies like this. Victoria Justice is relatable and likable as Naomi, and Pierson FodÃ© as Ely feels like a guy you would want as your gay best friend. Victoria Justice and Pierson Fode definitely bring out the best in their diverse characters. This movie is a fun and comedic movie that deals with struggles, young adults can all relate to."
8582,"From start to finish, this film exhilarates and crackles with brilliant on screen performances and masterfully directed fight sequences. Speaking of, the script would be for naught if it weren't for the beautiful performances by Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone. Sly joins an exclusive club of players like Bing Crosby, Paul Newman, and Al Pacino who got two Oscar nominations for playing the same role. It's also 39 years between the nominations that Stallone got for Best Actor for Rocky and Best Supporting Actor for Creed. Those scenes with Jordan are what got Sly Stallone that second Oscar nomination."
8583,"But since this is real life with Sam having had the vision to just record everything, what happened is what often happens in real life, which was that nothing bad happened. You get all emotions when watching this documentary about this two lovely sisters who found each other. They owe it to each and ever adoptee and their natural parents to do everything in their power to make thing right, work to bridge the gap that adoption separation and loss has caused and help families reunite and achieve some form of healing and continuity in the lives they have left to live. The sisters are great, they appreciate the lives they have been given, their parents and friends appreciate them. Some of the scenes are composed entirely of Sam and Anais just laughing."
8584,"If you like a good old fashioned thriller with surprising twists and an end that makes you think about matters of life and death, this is a film to watch. He can tell the story of his character only with the expression of his eyes and the director uses them well. Both of them are as convincing as FBI agents as a squirrel. There are a few bad dialogue lines and some clichÃ©s but the story is compelling and Hopkins still delivers. 5) The movie is very good and has a strong message behind it, its not that well hidden, you can identify yourself or someone with the pain that goes through the movie."
8585,"Pretty successful but the film has lots of mistakes in it. If you do not care details of the film, you would have fun. The actors credit include both young and talented actors beside very experienced and master actors in Turkish Cinema. Finally, If you want to laugh and miss Leyla and Mecnun go to the cinema and watch "" Bana Masal Anlatma "". Writer & director Burak Aksak put an extraordinary performance, similar to his previous works like Leyla ile Mecnun and Ben de Ã–zledim."
8587,"Its a simple but compelling story of two brothers who have drifted apart and the the twists and turns of life that bring them back in contact with each other. It's a drama with some funny moments. It's funny, in places, but it's also a great character study. Conrad also has a very voracious appetite for all things Charles Manson and very much desires to visit all places in the Los Angeles area that have a connection with the Manson family. This film was humorous, interesting, and made viewers pause and see that although some people kill they all have talents or gifts."
8589,"This special starts out bad, possibly purposely so, with Amy Poehler hamming it up something awful. But it grows on you with memories of Christmas's past. So this has the same star and it was co-written by one of the writers of Scrooged. In 10 years everyone will be calling this a Christmas must watch. Despite the negative reviews here, this little gem created some much needed Christmas cheer."
8590,"The unique Van Warmerdam chemistry of some of his other films didn't work as well in this one. This wild and dark Dutch film is not for everyone, but for those viewers who like all kinds of strange twists and surprises in their movies, this one could well be to your liking. Another great movie of the happy Van Warmerdam family! The acting is cool and straight forward, strictly directed by Alex van Warmerdam. Maria Kraakman played a nice part as Bax's depressive daughter who seems to be a damsel in distress, but at the end enjoys pulling the trigger as much as the contract killers."
8591,"Hunter S. Thompson Every journalism student should see Truth, a true version of a true event that included liberal CBS; liberal anchor, Dan Rather (Robert Redford); and liberal producer for 60 minutes, Mary Mapes (Cate Blanchett). As cautionary players on the big media stage, they are the finest examples of flawed human beings. The films chief assets are a smart, snappy screenplay and an another astoundingly nuanced performance by Cate Blanchett. They put the story together, and because 60 - Minutes is being pre-emptied by - shudder, a Billy Graham crusade - they decide to push the story out in four days rather than - well - actually baking the story more before rushing it to air. Blanchett is one of the best actors working now."
8592,"There are fourth - wall breaking monologues, a model in a bubble bath explaining economics as well as a singing idol and a celebrity chef using metaphors of cooking and gambling to explain the economic crisis. The acting is stellar from the stars to the bit players. And like the Bourbons, t The cast is stellar--especially Christian Bale and Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling as well as the minor players. The celebrity cameo explanations of subprime debt, collateralized debt obligations, and synthetic CDOs are not only simple but accurate--the two involving Anthony Bourdain and Selena Gomez are downright elegant."
8593,"A ton of laughs and a good time, with a tiny bit of poking fun at the "" Western Films "" genre. There are plenty of Happy Madison films out there, going back as early as the 90's! If you're looking for a good time and lots of laughs, you've found the right film. There's two kinds of Netflix programming: the stuff you watch regularly and intently, like Netflix's ongoing series, and then the stuff you just sort of have playing in the background as you do other stuff. The synopsis of this Netflix original sounds like a standard traditional western: this Adam Sandler vehicle is anything but."
8594,"Hertzfeldt creates a better sci - fi story than let's say Interstellar with barely any budget and just in 16 minutes. Her days consist of playing with her precious cars, eating lunch, and wandering off to each adventure; her perceptions of happiness and sadness are heavily dichotomous and immediate. It's a strangely endearing name even with its clearly sci - fi sound, and it bestows an importance to this child that the society of a century later very dearly treasures. But it's again oddly appropriate; Hertzfeldt manages to elicit the deepest emotions from these simplistic representations of humans. After he has not made a new film for 4 years now, it's really nice to see him back with "" World of Tomorrow "", a 17 - minute short film and his take on science - fiction."
8597,"The movie also has a few heartwarming moments to add to a really funny script. The mix of polar opposites Will Ferrell and Mark Walhberg was almost perfect. The beautiful Linda Cardellini plays Sara the wife / ex-wife who is caught in the hilarious tug of war between her two suitors. If you're looking for an hour and a half of laughs, look no further and go see this enjoyable movie. There are consistent laughs throughout, but perhaps not one stand out scene that will be memorable for years to come."
8598,"Just like comedy skits from these types of TV shows, some of the jokes succeed resulting in uproarious laughter while others produce a mere snigger or nothing at all. Watch out for Greta Lee who plays Hae - Won, the Korean beauty consultant who steals some of the laughs from her more illustrious co-stars. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are two of the funniest comedians working right now. The chemistry between the two of them is electric, and there are a handful of good laughs scattered amidst the almost two - hour runtime. Really, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, and this is as good as they can do, this movie is for teenage boys, young pubescent kids."
8602,"This movie had been in the making for over a decade and hence had already created ample curiosity in the moviegoers minds. The music, screenplay, acting, dialogues and the beautiful story of 3 complex characters - everything is magnificent and spectacular! This movie is poetry in motion, easily one of the most epic tales in Indian history being translated in such a classy yet relatable manner on screen! Each scene and each dialogue gets the viewers completely hooked! Ranveer Singh has always delivered fabulous performances, but this performance will be remembered until the end of his career as the performance that catapulted him into the hearts of the Indian cinema lovers."
8605,"Shot on a low budget in only a couple of locations with a limited cast, CLOSE RANGE may be the most compact action film of 2015, but it's a pretty good one at that. Potentially the best DTV action title of the year. These scenes are an even balance of fights and shootouts, and both are exhilarating. The best of the gunfights take place within a home, at close quarters, with the shooters blazing at each other across furniture and through walls. To be just, the fighting scenes where incredibly well executed and performed."
8611,"A car chase still can be entertaining if those scenes can offer something thrilling, this film action scenes are rather dull and pointless. In this compact segment from a desperately lived life Cheadle even finds time for a little romance in the person of a beautiful black actress with the tongue twister name, Emayatzy Corninealdi, who accompanied Don to Berlin. especially those featuring Frances Taylor (Emayatzy Corinealdi) as Miles' beautiful, talented and supportive wife. In the press conference which preceded the screening Cheadle said that this film which he worked on for six years, learning to play the trumpet in the process, is practically a lifelong dream come true. Cheadle's tribute to The Prince of Darkness is as open to interpretation as the hundreds of songs from Davis' recordings over thirty plus years."
8648,"This film is darn near perfect. The court testimony, the interviews with neighbors and William Quigley, you really get a sense for who this man is and what he was able to accomplish. Like a lot of documentaries about crime puzzles, many of them are in desperate need of a narrator if for no other reason than it may be difficult to understand how all the pieces fit, risking leaving the viewer with a jumbled mess. Certainly, the best known is Clark Rockeller, but he also want by Christopher Chichester, Chip Smith, and Chris C. Crowe among others. In the late 1970's, Christian Gerhartsreiter who had been born and raised in the small provincial town of Siegsdorf in southern Germany came to the United States intent on "" becoming "" an American."
8620,"Generally, May - December romances involve older men with younger women, and Field herself starred in one such film, "" Murphy's Romance "" with James Garner, although the age difference in that film disappeared through the stars' chemistry. It's a very realistic look at what it's like for someone who has an age difference form the rest of their co workers. Sally Field gives one of her best performances to date and really plays this character perfectly. Nevertheless, the exceptional performance by Sally Field is well worth seeing and the proceedings are often amusing, even if a few scenes between her and Greenfield may make some uncomfortable. Sally Field (turning 70 in 2016) gives a terrific performance, and it goes much deeper than someone who puts her reading glasses on top of her regular glasses and wears giant bows in her giant hairpiece."
8193,"On that note, actually, the incredible bike chase is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the great action, but credit has to go to director Christopher McQuarrie for excellently turning this into a good - looking and intense action thriller, using great camera work (avoiding shaky cam) to make it so brilliantly entertaining. Everything about that movie was just perfect! One of the few movies where the ending just pleases you so much. It is fascinatingly complex and dynamic â€“ moving from country to country, dealing with characters who have questionable allegiances â€“ all on top of Ethan Hunt trying to outrun the CIA while trying to get to the bottom of what the Syndicate really wants. Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner & Alec Baldwin all give great performances & have about the same screen time."
8595,"While the film feels disjointed and situations are forced, it still has a few really funny moments. Like many sequels it suffers from trying to have too many callbacks to the first film. That's not to say that it didn't have it's problems, but it excelled in what mattered most: It was an excellent representation of what made the original so great. All comedy sequels are tough to do, but normally, by keeping everything pretty similar, you can get an entertaining movie. The original Zoolander wasn't a dumb film, in fact it was a really clever comedy that centred around a dumb character."
8596,"Furthermore, multiple laugh out loud - moments. Its her funniest, saddest, and truest performance to date."
8624,"It was a fun ride with plenty of action, plenty of humour, and a great cast - Chris Hemsworth brings his usual cheery action hero to the mix, Jessica Chastain was a good addition as The Huntsman's wife, and Emily Blunt played the fragile Ice Queen wonderfully well. The Dwarfs were comic relief as always, but it worked well with fewer of them and a couple of females in the mix. In a time where it is very common to see a lot of negativity and cynicism in reality and depicted on screen, it is a relief to watch an optimistic fantasy film with beautiful sets, visual effects, and morals. The relationships between the characters are interesting, although some are slightly disappointing because they aren't as developed as they could be. Despite being villains, the two queen characters of the movie had touching, and surprising moments of humanity later on in the story."
8630,"In any other scenes when actual acting was required he just wasn't good at all. But if you like a good clean movie that isn't filled with naked sex starved scenes you will enjoy it. The sound track is fun, the pratfalls are OK, but the stories are real. A movie about Mother's Day should invoke feelings of love and gratitude towards mothers and show a strong bond. Just as Valentine's Day is a big favorite of millions of people - it did not get any Oscars - but it is a movie that people remember."
8599,"In an ethereal golden pond, Grand Master Oogway appears to Po, and informs him his journey has come full circle, revealing his role by selecting Po as Dragon Warrior is also because of his descent from the ancient pandas, and his embodiment of the yin - yang. Using what they learned from Po and about who they are, Li, Tigress, Mr. Ping and the pandas are able to use their chi to save him. Cant find any other Negatives: 1. The standout for the limited screen time he has is Seth Rogen's Mantis."
8504,""" Why does Luthor introduce Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent to each other? "" The movie perfectly captured how much this Bruce Wayne is addicted to the batsuit. It is further proof that DC may be a master of the animated movie and they may be brilliant in the way they approach many of the TV properties but when it comes to movies they still can't pull it together. When Batman steals the Kryptonite, it would have spoiled whatever Luthor had planned, but Luthor just eggs Superman to fight Batman like they were in cahoots. The Zod fight actually affected Bruce in the most personal of ways - ways that Luthor and Lois were not."
8601,"Just beyond the opening scenes, Standoff quickly rises above its cheapness as an enjoyable and gripping suspense thriller. But the major asset of the movie is the performance from the 2 leads. The movie has emotions and suspense. Good performances and directing and you have what it takes. Jane and his wife were having arguments."
8644,"With Roan just 1 point behind in the polls, the NFFA decides that Roan must be' taken care of' in the upcoming Purge. She claims that the NFFA uses The Purge with economical purpose to get rid of poor and sick people and is the favorite to win. It's cool that James DeMonaco and his team aren't just content to coast on what they've built and try something different each time."
8487,Star Trek Beyond was so devoid of the primordial concepts set up by Mr. Gene Roddenberry that it contributed to the confused identity of the picture. Star Trek Beyond also has one of the weakest villains in its history. Some of the scenes were of course visually impressive though sometimes things would fly around too much and contaminate the image. Scotty transports Spock and McCoy into one of Krall's drone ships where they eject the crew. The older films and TV Shows next to spectacle always offered good drama and thought provoking concepts about many essential things that matter in life.
8604,"The acting was excellent - Matt Smith, as others have said is wonderful - and the production superb. The peculiarities of the novel are self evident and, when the zombie influences are absent, you could think you are watching another excellent version of Pride and Prejudice. The costumes and scenery are top notch and very believable of the period. The sets, costumes, dialogue and fight scenes work together to create an unusual movie experience that will generate plenty of laughs while not dwelling on the zombies or violence (it is PG - 13)."
8635,"To try and spice it up they tried the twist with Morgan Freeman's character, but nobody believed it, not even Mr. Freeman. Who cares, a magician never reveals his tricks (hint: CGI)."
8606,"The writing really was terrific with a plot that had more ups and downs than a mountain range, more ins and outs than Hampton Court Maze and more twists and turns than a dozen corkscrews, in short it was a triumph. The playing by Cumberbatch, Freeman and Andrew Scott as the three main protagonists was never better. The references to the main series are also enjoyable."
8608,"Together with some conversations from Kim himself, which was recorded by Choi and Shin secretly, audience gets an deeper insight on the man who was seen as a tyrant of the world. The documentary also covers the incident from the different perspective: the traumas faced by Choi and Shin's family member, especially their two adopted children; British police officers conducting the investigation on the disappearance of Choi and Shin in Hong Kong, where both were kidnapped in different locations; the South Korean CIA agent investigating the kidnap, which links to the study of North Korea movie industry and Kim's passion towards movies; Japanese film critic who assisted Shin to passed the message to their family back in South Korea; an former North Korea adviser who works for Kim and shares the unknown side of the late North Korea dictator. It was a time when Kim Jong - un's father, Kim Jong - il, had absolute power over North Koreans and, among other things, used cinema to spread the idea North Korea should be an example of success and democracy. The Lovers and the Despot is one of the most important documentaries that document the evolution of North and South Korea film industry. The Lovers and the Despot explores the rather unusual love - hate relationship between a very unlikely trio: South Korean actress Choi Eun - hee and her ex-husband movie director Shin Sang - OK, where both were kidnap by their greatest fan, Kim Jong - il."
8609,"Unlike most horror movies And above all, A story with actually a hint of Originality in it. This film skillfully blends some elements of earlier horror movies like "" The Shining "" (1980), "" Child's Play "" (1988) and "" The Others "" (2001), but has a fresh and even more modern feel to it. And even the greatest movies has bullshit in them, and that goes for movies in general. Unlike most horror movies Good direction and cinematography. Many scenes are with her and the doll alone."
8610,"Emilia Clarke, Sam Claflin, Janet McTeer, Charles Dance, Matthew Lewis, just to name a few, beautifully create an emotional journey, which is more than just a heart - breaking love story. The story (of a young woman who cares for a quadriplegic young man) is strong, the direction and cinematography good though not exceptional, the screen writing also good - not - exceptional, the supporting cast (especially Janet McTeer and Charles Dance) and leading man (Sam C.) quite good, and the emotional notes it hits, though all predictable and often a bit overwrought (cue swelling, heartwarming music.) The house Claflin's character lives in looks very nice. Playing opposite Claflin, Emilia Clarke ("" Game of Thrones "") shines through with her naivety and authentic, clumsy attitude on the screen. From her crazy outfits in the movie to her charming personality, Clarke has it all."
8632,"Blake Lively diving better than a shark, burning water, surfers that go surf without letting anybody know about spot and timing spoiled this movie but the bird was a solid 2 stars. Its only purpose is to give you a thrill - ride during that time; an adrenaline rush based on an ubiquitous fear among humans: being stranded in the ocean with a shark. This thing is huge, like the Jaws' shark's father huge. There are some far - fetched scenes, sure, but Jaws had them as well and it's hailed as a classic."
8612,"The story is gleefully unapologetic delivering chills and full blooded twists (the biggest of all is the intense ending reveal) even thought it deviates from the monster POV storyline. On the other hand, if you expect a good thriller (with some added Sci - Fi at the end), good acting and disturbing plot twists, then it's the kind of movie for you. This is a story of a money - grabbing company, who bought a perfectly good script, and ruined the ending with aliens."
8613,"This film, despite its good lead cast appears to have left the brains of plot and due process behind as it made the leap across the pond. Get a big bowl of popcorn and some sodi - pops, and enjoy relentless, shooting, stabbing, swearing and explosions."
8486,"There was soul to that movie, even though it was an ensemble cast, characters were developed, the story progressed and there were heroes you cheered for and aliens you despised. It has two good CGI scenes, which you can watch at home some months from now. It is true that when you are young, you see movies like the original "" ID4 "" from a different perspective, most often you judge them better than what they really are, and this undeniably is a fact of life. It just rocks for the following reasons: The robot from Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy is here. Characters explain to the audience the basic plot five minutes after exposition time."
8614,"Zootopia is a fantastic film that has breath taking animation, AMAZING characters and a very clever story! From the studio that brought you Tangled, Wreck - It Ralph, Frozen & Big Hero 6, Zootopia surfaces as a highly original, incredibly refreshing, thoroughly engaging, surprisingly timely & delightfully subversive beast fable about prejudice & stereotype that not only marks a new creative high for Disney but is arguably the finest film that this legendary animation studio has come up with in their Revival Era, so far. In fact, this entire movie brings great and mature messages for both kids and adults! An ingenious blend of sophisticated storytelling, jubilant humour & thought - provoking themes that amazes, entertains & enlightens without ever compromising with the fun factor, Zootopia is a definite delight for viewers of all ages, and is undoubtedly the best film of the year, so far. Pixar Animation Studios, which still has the septre of originality in their daring high - concept design works, which nevertheless let "" Zootopia "" become instant classic animation due to its consequently motion picture history snatching moments of reminiscence in superior animated dÃ©cor with characters and environmental production design by long - term art director David Goetz, enriched by the fairly - ear - lingering score composed by talented composer Michael Giacchino."
8631,"As the film's tag - line admits "" The Nice Guys "" are "" far from nice "", and this is a sort of bromance buddy movie of the likes of "" Lethal Weapon "". But "" The Nice Guys "" has an edge that those films of the 80's couldn't have got away with. The basics of this scene are given a fresh and wonderfully gory rework that is truly memorable. Some of their dialogue appears distinctly ad - libbed, which shows how comfortable they were with the roles. The acting star of the show though is young Australian Angourie Rice as Holland's morally - centred and bright daughter Holly, who steals just about every scene she's in."
8615,"It's a good mix of real world situations and over the top action fight scenes that would be on par with any Hollywood film, extreme shock comedy and moments that will literally make you gag. Reunited by chance with his brother after 28 years played by Mark Strong. The "" plot "" cracks along and the jokes are pretty much continuous, and filthy. Seems a lot of people (mainly Americans) are slating this movie, saying the humour and gags missed. This movie had a lot of funny scenes (especially if you understand the English)."
8485,"The movie has cool set pieces, action scenes and fantastic costumes. sure it would take years to build up a universe like that, but come on, that's what Marvel did and their movies are amazing! He should have full gotten his own movie or only been in certain scenes."
8481,"For an original story done by Illumination, it does creatively borrow off the concepts of both Toy Story as well as the 2008 film Bolt, yet it flows out well with the voice cast bringing these characters to life which include stand - up comic Louis C. K. voicing the leading dog Max, Jenny Slate (Saturday Night Live, Zootopia) as Max's potential love interest Gidget, and' Modern Family' star Eric Stonestreet as Duke. The one that would have the best animation, story, characters, emotions, etc. . The two directors and four writers who made this include a couple names that worked on films from the Minions universe, so nobody should be surprised that a Minions short film runs before "" Pets "" and there is also another reference at the very end with one of the pets being dressed like a Minion. For example, the two main characters (dogs) felt a lot like the protagonists from the "" Monsters Inc. "" universe in terms of their size and interactions. It's colorful, it's fun at times, provides a positive message about acceptance and provides a clever enough high concept to keep the kids on their keesters for 80 minutes."
8641,"Two popular actors play as comic foils to one another as well as provide great drama with some cool stunts thrown in. Lots of action scenes, cool stunts, but the story was dealt a poor telling. Sure, there are a few awkward moments, yet they make the best out of it to present a light humorous spectacle, a better buddy cop gimmick than expected. Recently a lot of Kevin Hart's movies have been pretty lack luster. You can groan at its dumb plot, get antsy over action scenes where no one (not even trained CIA gunmen) can shoot straight or frown at Calvin and Stone whispering strategies whilst pointed with guns, but Central Intelligence is hard to dislike because Johnson and Hart shine perfectly in their roles and hence, elevate this film from subpar to moderately enjoyable."
8658,"Don't go expecting an epiphany or any gritty revelations, this is a story retold with love and one suspects, awe. One of the people who Ron Howard interviews in the movie is Whoopi Goldberg. Throughout the film, there are quite a few songs by the band which get played. For the casual fan it should, for the most part, be a fun 2Â 1/4 hours packed with lots of interesting footage and interviews. The landmark controversies do feature in this documentary, including the band's infamous "" butcher cover "" artwork for their single release "" Yesterday and today "" as well as John Lennon's notorious "" bigger than Jesus "" utterance which seemed capable of derailing their success."
8423,"religious extremists who don't understand the profound nature of the supernatural skill, check! Michael Shannon possesses such a magnetic screen presence, you just can't take your eyes off him and Joel Edgerton certainly makes his presence felt, even if his role remains a little unexplained. Kirsten Dunst and Adam Driver offer good support and Jaeden Lieberher is rather good as Alton. In terms of the characters, Michael Shannon's character does feel like a father who would genuinely do this for his son (especially because he may feel as though he is making up for lost time) and the other characters are very enjoyable and feel necessary to the movie. The comparisons with Starman (1984) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) are apt, but this is very definitely a different movie altogether."
8645,"Based on the outtakes over the end credits the cast was having more laughs then the audience. You know the premise from the trailers but where are the laughs, few and far between. There's romance, there's comedy and, kind of, adventure (not sure on the one film classifiers at IMDb)."
8625,"It does, however, repeat the same slapstick gimmicks over and over again, completely uninterested in their effectiveness the first time around. In fact, the funniest moments are the unrelated, extraneous conversations that fill up space between physical actions. As Mac and Kelly attempt to get the girls evicted, and Kappa Nu fights back to stay put, both sides engage in a free - for - all of lying, cheating, and stealing that quickly forces everyone involved to decide just how far they're willing to go to win. The first Neighbors movie was funny, not the funniest movie made or anything like that but pretty funny. Young versus old and the naive versus the experienced seem like worthwhile contrasts, but the script never focuses on one idea long enough to land a memorable line."
8640,"A good story isn't about a lot of action, a lot of events, it lies in the subtleties and how they come together. 6) If a pilot of the space ship is such an expert on the ship itself, then how come that he screws everything up so constantly? Following the success of movies like Moon, someone thought it would be a good idea to try with a movie about a mission towards Mars."
8652,"The previous movies had fun moments, especially because they were so over the top and so amazingly fake. And now, they are even opening up the asylum gates by having Lavantuala in the same universe as Sharknado, which is pretty funny, but them to throw in a random reference to John Carpenters Christine in there with it, just beggars belief. The over-the-top factors (of which there were hundreds, of course) weren't thrown together haphazardly - they were all woven together in a strangely well executed tapestry of utter ridiculousness. It will be interesting to see if the bride Imani A. Hakim (as Gabrielle) appears in "" Sharknado 5 "" (2017). All of the' SHARKNADO' films are laughably bad, which makes them also somewhat enjoyable."
8629,"In terms of the little B action movies that have been coming out this is definitely one of the best ones, but again this movie has been done over and over and is just not all that exciting. There are a few neat twists in this but for the most part you can predict everything that is going to happen pretty easy. When Detective Gibson (Sam Trammell) and other corrupt police officers are unable to bring the killers to justice, Stanley turns to his old friend Dennis (Christopher Meloni) and decides to take matters into his own hands. His actual BMI, his talent and of course the simpleness of this movie brings the spectator a trip back where movies were about their genre, in this case an action movie."
8651,"The vistas are absolutely marvelous, its characters look eerily lively and the fights are utterly unworldly. It's a very politically focused tale and it does try to deliver many subplots and characters, no doubt a foundation for the game's world and its splendor. However, when it retains the focus or follows the action, it is arguably one of the most eye - popping spectacles from animated movie. This is what superhero movies and co. should look like. Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV is great example of how CGI does a brilliant job in capturing the world of Final Fantasy XV in the best way possible."
8626,"' Hush' is a lot like' The Strangers', except instead of strangers plural it's only one man, and instead of a husband and wife being terrorized it's a deaf and mute recluse. It's very tense and cleverly written bar a few clichÃ© tropes that come with this kind of movie. It's constantly engaging, and that has a lot to do with the terrific performances of both the man and Maggie, and there are a few scenes that are genuinely depraved and chilling. It doesn't break any new ground, but following' The Babadook' and' It Follows',' Hush' continues to reinspire the subtle, quiet corner of the genre and bodes well for the future of psychological thrillers. The performances are solid, which is vital for a film that virtually revolves around two characters; Kate Siegel (who co-wrote the film with Flanagan) stars as the deaf Maddie, and is extremely believable, while John Gallagher Jr. plays the anonymous nutjob who is more despicable than he is scary."
8362,"If you love X-Men, as well as apocalyptic superhero movies, then this is the film for you. The way he "" persuades "" other mutants to join him is absolutely unbelievable - he basically just offers to increase a mutant's power and in return demands help to kill billions of people. The recent Deadpool, who ostensibly shares the universe with the X-men, was awesome. And yes, Quicksilver returns and tops his amazing scene from X-Men: Days of Future's Past. He recruits his four horsemen Magneto, Storm, Psylocke, and Angel giving them greater power."
8619,"Watch Un Chien Andalou and then got to Burning Man festival and you'll have all the inspiration you will need for a sequel. Critics giving Demon positive reviews and arguing that its monomaniacal focus on style is intentionally on par with the film's message are missing the reality that NWR's creative juices are simply dried up at the moment. The fact that a good sixth of the movie feels like the director got away with making fetish porn with an Amazon Studios (and about a half dozen other production companies) budget? Aside from a memorable strobe - light inspired scene of a performance at a model - populated L. A. party, Refn adds nothing new to his aesthetic arsenal that he has not already splashed on the screen with his previous four films. It seems that, after the massive success of Drive, Refn is being given the opportunity to make the films he wants to make and take a lot of creative license."
8656,"Loved the performance by Hrithik and perfect direction by Ashutosh Gowariker. Hrithik Roshan is great in this role and by far the best part of the movie. Hrithik (Sarman) who plays the role of a simple farmer, lands himself in the town of Mohenjo Daro and is mesmerized by its beauty and grandeur. Performances: Hrithik Roshan is back with a bang and has delivered a stellar performance in Mohenjo Daro. It is certainly one of Hrithik's best performance."
8650,"Bank robberies have been featured in many hundreds of films since the early days of cinema: The Great Train Robbery for example dates back to 1903! More recent heist classics such as "" Oceans 11 "", "" Die Hard "", "" Run Lola Run "" and "" The Dark Knight Rises "" tend towards the stylised end of the act. Where this film delivers interest is in aligning the protagonists' drivers with the banking and mortgage' crimes' featured in last year's "" The Big Short "". A cat and mouse game ensues with the lawmen staking out the most likely next hits. The performances of the main leads are all excellent, with Chris Pine given the chance to show more acting chops than he has had chance to with his previous Kirk / Jack Ryan characters."
8649,"In short it is the delivery of the film, not the origins of it, that makes it work. The presence of Middlemarch got the headlines due to his role in Silicon Valley, but the other two actors are just as good â€“ in particular Gray gives the final dialogue scene a lot more heart than it has on paper. Some reviews have described it as "" hilarious and intense "", which gives you an indication of the average level of intelligence out there. "" Sunspring "" is a 9 - minute live action short film from 2016, so still a pretty new one and these slightly under 10 minutes include at the very beginning and very end already a bit of a behind the scenes feature as it is explained how a robot named Benjamin wrote the script for that one."
8634,"The robot designs are nice and detailed and the battle scenes are made very well. The acting as everything in the movie is very solid, a group of mid - known actors each one of them played his role as it should be played and again it was very controlled by the director, awesome performance by the group leader Thure Lindhardt. The sound effects in the movie as well played a great role like how the robots speak and interact, the gun shots, etc. If you are a fan of movies like Skyline, Predator, and Terminator, you will probably enjoy this film. The special effects are top notch, the acting is good, the story is engaging, the pace is keeping you on your tows."
8571,"The scene between Alden Ehrenreich and Ralph Finnes is a gem. Alden Ehrenreich is a breath of fresh air with vintage breezes that are exciting, compelling and totally disarming. What he experiences is basically a relentless barrage of vignettes and personalities. Each has its style, director, crew, and most importantly its stars. This is one of the best ensemble performances in recent memory."
8361,"The action scenes are fantastic, the fight scenes on the airport are incredible heart pulse breath taking awesome. The fight scenes were very well done and well choreographed. Robert Downey Jr. does a good job, Paul Rudd he is fun in the flick, he has a great moment as Ant - Man he has a few moments but one predictable. Anthony Mackie has a lot of good screen time, specially in the action moments. "" Captain America: Civil War is a 2016 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Captain America, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures."
8633,""" Ah - ga - ssi "", a. k. a. "" The Handmaiden "", is a classy South Korean erotic thriller divided in three parts and directed by Chan - wook Park. Hideko is supported by her Uncle Kouzuki (Jin - woong Jo) and the gold - digger "" Count Fujiwara "" (Jung - woo Ha), who is indeed son of peasants, wants to marry her to steal her inheritance. Whenever Chan - wook Park makes a film, it must undoubtedly be compared to his masterpiece, "" Oldboy "". All of these devices are used to full effect and create surprising twists on par with Park Chan - wook's Oldboy. Park Chan - Wook's The Handmaiden is almost as good as the film that put him on the map, Oldboy, and brings such ferocity and energy that it will be one of the most unforgettable films of 2016."
8642,The original trilogy still stands out as one of the most intelligent post-Cold War spy action thrillers and it mostly succeeded in being the last word in the genre.
8647,"This is the premise behind "" Nerve "", a film whose producers must have wet themselves with excitement that the Pokemon Go craze aligned so nicely with the release of their film. It also acts as a vehicle for up and coming talents such as Emma Roberts and Dave Franco, who both give good performances. Emma Roberts and Dave Franco both give solid performances in this film, and they each work well off of each other. Conclusion Nerve has good performances from its two leads and a unique visual style, and it certainly has its fair share of entertainment."
8360,"Flashbacks and fast - forwards can be annoying as hell, but when done right, they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting. Deadpool can't help himself; as long as he's able to breathe he'll crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him. Deadpool is a 2016 film that the eighth film in the X-Men franchise where The Merc with the Mouth seeks revenge in a humorous way. Wade moves into the home of an elderly blind woman named Al, and with the advice of his best friend Weasel, he becomes a masked vigilante named "" Deadpool "", and begins hunting down Francis and dismantling his organization. The next night, Weasel convinces Deadpool to go back to Vanessa, but when they arrive at the strip club she works at, Deadpool discovers that she has been kidnapped, and Francis and Angel Dust tell him to meet up with them on a decommissioned aircraft carrier at a scrapyard."
8643,"After a great opening scene, there is the filmic equivalent of "" dead air "" for about 35 minutes and when the script does finally get in gear it stumbles and falls, subject to a wildly disjointed narrative and equally bizarre editing. Christoph Waltz and Sam Jackson remain two of the most over-exposed stars in Hollywood and, good as they are, they are running out of clever ways to play the same character over and over. There's a moment in David Yates' excellent and emotionally resonant Legend of Tarzan when George Washington Williams', played by Samuel L. Jackson, goads civilized Tarzan, played by Alexander Skarsgard, just a little too much. In this single small moment, Yates and Skarsgard put on display Tarzan's utter commitment to the woman he loves while at the same time same evoking the internal contradiction of a man who in adulthood could pass among society as a aristocratic Englishman, but whose feral upbringing has left him with a volatile beast within that can overwhelm the civilized trappings in an instant. Unlike the filmmakers who have come before him, Yates effectively captures this duality â€“ and in so doing delivers a film that is fresh and appealing to modern sensibilities, yet is faithful to the character of the books in ways that Hollywood has never attempted before."
8646,"Also the small parts, like the scenes between Margo and the doorman, are precious. At a time when far too many movies are made for a young audience devoid of aesthetic sensibility, it's movies like this that rekindle love of film in the mature movie - goer. The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and Netflix viewers alike."
8654,"Bringing out the perfect blend of 1980s nostalgia. With its amazing 80s atmosphere and creepy X-files meets E. T feel this show is set to impress. The setting and style of everything in the locations where also great to see and felt real and interesting. The way everything was shot also captures every moment expertly and really helps to draw out those story moments with greater emotion. Memorable, exciting, dark and haunting Netflix knocks Stranger Things out of the park, 10/10."
8356,"Paula Patton did a fantastic job with Garona. Ben Foster and Ben Schnetzer did a wonderful job playing the magic wielding Mages. So Everything about this movie felt right. But more important for the fanboys, feel comfortable bring non-WoW playing friends and families to the movie. They were on the edge of their seats the whole time and wanting more!"
8088,"This movie also shows that besides major studios big money, you can still enjoy indie movies with a great story, amazing actors and a smart and strong director willing to carry his movie till it's made. Although Merendino made it clear Stevos (Lillard) and Mike (Segel) would not return, many fans still held onto hope that maybe they would at least make a brief cameo."
8355,"well, okay - except for Morgan Freeman who is unbelievably wooden as an almost God - like figure, a nice Big Daddy who steps in to explain and arrange everything for the best. The frustrating thing they didn't even have to take a chance, the book is over a 150 years old, there was a blockbuster stage show and 2 blockbuster films, all they had to do was minorly tweak the original book, or use one of the smash - hit films as a guide. The best way to describe it is "" Hercules meets Robin Hood "" and had it been a TV show, lots would have been forgiven because most TV shows seldom has the budget or the actors to do make historical drama's stand out. In a lot of scenes characters pull of certain moves that they would not have been able to if they did not have control over the power of editing. It is drenched in fiery music to build suspense and chopped to pieces in editing so that you hardly understand who is who and what is happening among the clouds of dust."
8622,"Surprisingly, using a pirate treasure map story to explain the origins of the Easter egg hunt works out well. Scrat's latest mishap with his acorn is worth a chuckle too. "" Ice Age: The Great Egg - Scapade "" is a 25 - minute animated short film from this year and the title already gives it away. In Ice Age: The Great Egg - Scapade harried prehistoric bird mom Ethel (Taraji P. Henson, EMPIRE) entrusts her precious, soon - to - hatch egg to Sid (John Leguizamo). When she recommends him to her neighbors â€“ a condor mom (Wendy Williams), Cholly Bear (Gabriel Iglesias) and Gladys Glypto (Lili Estefan) â€“ business booms at his new egg - sitting service."
8627,"This is one of few real time films - meaning the flow of events matches the duration of the film - that is quite successful in keeping the viewer's attention all along, and Jodie Foster is very efficient as a director presenting what seems initially a daunting technical subject (how a computer "" glitch "" causes an 800 Million Dollar loss to shareholders in a public traded company) as a dramatic thriller that never looses pace. The cast is excellent, Julia Roberts as the ever conscious producer calculating how each camera angle is best to follow on the unfolding live drama, George Clooney in one of his finest roles as the careless theatrical advice giver of the money program who gradually comes to realize how damaging his show is to the masses (in one particular touching scene he is in the street in NY and sees on - lookers imitating his dance moves on the show, and he becomes aware of what a buffoon he is), and finally Jack O'Connel who is very convincing as the candid investor who really wants to know how "" the system "" works (casting him was an inspired choice, he is not a well - known actor so he adds more credibility to the character he plays, a simple man from the street who looses all his money in Wall Street). Even though the film deals with a serious subject, an eye opener leading one to wonder about the real money monsters out there, it remains an excellent thriller with top class actors. Producer - actor George Clooney is known for his anti-establishment movies, and ones such as "" Ides of March "" are excellent. The direction is assured, acting is superb and production values are excellent."
8655,"Director Tinu Suresh Desai uses a lot of dramatic freedom to keep the general audience engaged in the trial's proceedings. ' Rustom' is a fictional account of the famous Nanavati v / s State of Maharashtra case that delivers justice in quite an entertaining manner. Prolonged periods of absence on official duty brought Officer Rustom Pavri's (Akshay Kumar) wife closer to Preeti (Esha Gupta) and her brother Vikram (Arjan Bajwa). Citizens pick their sides with Preeti Makhija hiring the best Sindhi lawyer (Sachin Khedekar) to prosecute the accused while the Parsi community, including a local newspaper's editor, rally behind Rustom's defense of himself. As the courtroom drama unfolds, truth hinges on perceptions and fabrication that lead to both comedy and tension."
8623,"The Music is amazing even the original songs are fantastic. Its an amazing movie for all ages. Also the acting is great and the 80s of course give the movie a nostalgic and beautiful tone 40 - something audiences will definitely get another level of enjoyment out of all the allusions to great 80s bands. For their part, Walsh - Peelo and McKenna, besides being fine young actors, are talented musicians in real life â€“ all the better to perform the film's excellent original songs."
8508,"The wolf cubs are cute and the voice of Scarlett Johansson is mesmerizing. Second, good characters with relevant appearances. Disney Picture is the best company in making top and number 1 family movies. A high point of the movie was when Mogli helped the elephant baby from the pit. Movies like this must be appreciated so that they can inspire more great work, and maybe one day, even erase movies like Transformers."
8657,"** Review based on original Japanese version Whoever is judging the Japanese original film as a non-Japanese native speaker, chill and think twice before telling others. How would politicians, bureaucrats, academics, military and other countries react, using real political systems and real technology available today? Maybe it was an homage to old Kaiju movies as well. All in all, it was a great Japanese film that comes out only once in few years. Some the best scenes are when the characters stop acting like politicians and have casual and occasionally humorous dialogue."
8639,"James Wan's trademark visual style is repeated in this movie - his bag of tricks sometimes yielding a sense of deja vu but generally working like a charm. What's really enjoyable about this movie, is its nostalgic recreation of 70s England. The film doesn't give anything new at the horror movie genre, but its set pieces are often impressive, even if sometimes rely a bit on jump scares. It combined every creepy trope you can think of (ghosts, dolls, music boxes, mirrors, you name it), and it actually worked thanks to a genre - savvy director behind the curtains. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilsons performances are excellent as you buy into their relationship and learn some lessons on marriage."
8621,"It also helps to know movies well to catch several of the references or tropes. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments, but the plot of Keanu falls back into clichÃ©d territory far too often. With that said, when the laughs hit, they hit hard. The supporting cast is okay, with a few surprises here and there, but the real hero here is Keanu the kitten. Get some friends and go have some good laughs."
8628,"Witty and fast - paced, with a good mix of gags for the adults and their kids, plus a potent dose of the studio's famed poignancy. No shortage of colorful new characters there, literally and figuratively, not the least of which is Ed O'Neill's escape artist "" septipus "" (having lost a tentacle in the touch tank), who treads dangerously close to becoming a deus ex machina with his versatility."
8638,"Andy Samberg excels at the comedy but also on making the lead a very likable protagonist, no mater his flaws. Still the movie has massive laughs, the references are on point, and some of the songs are actually pretty good parodies of other genres. Popstar, the brain child of the YouTube - turned - SNL stars The Lonely Island, touches on these things enough, but mostly it's just fantastic jokes. This is certainly a Lonely Island movie and probably one of the best of their movies it's completely relentless even the greatest comedy kings and queens will love it. Like Rob Reiner's masterpiece, it's a mockumentary and a fun one at that with laughs coming out of the whazoo."
8637,"The obvious answer is yes, of course it's dumb, it's more superhero schlock: kiddie - fare enjoyed by 30 - somethings. The best parts of this movie are not of the turtles talking but when things go all smashy - smash - smash. This purpose splits the turtles team, and causes all sorts of drama that the Turtles prioritize over doing any crime - fighting. Shredder recruits the two criminals that were being transported alongside him, Bebop and Rocksteady, and has Stockman use Krang's mutagen on them to transform them into powerful animal mutants. With the acceptance and blessing of the police, the Turtles go into action, confronting Krang aboard the still - assembling Technodrome."
3398,"The best thing about this film is that it was done in IMAX form which really details everything so clearly and incredibly. Michael Jordan was the most famous, most honored, and probably the greatest professional basketball player of his generation, an athlete whose intelligence, charisma, and dazzling on - court skill helped earn his game a new level of popularity and won Jordan a record six NBA title rings. The new IMAX theatre opened here in Nashville with two movies, one a 3 - D about a dinosaur and the other was Jordan to the Max. Truly the film does lose a little luster on a non-Omnimax screen, but overall the production is first class all the way with intriguing interviews and cinematography adding to the movie's superiority. Michael Jordan to the Max, shot and initially released in the high - definition IMAX film format, takes a documentary look at Jordan's life and career, focusing primarily on the 1998 NBA playoffs, in which Jordan and the Chicago Bulls achieved their sixth professional championship under his leadership, shortly before announcing his final retirement from the court."
2145,"The Yards could have used a bit of tightening up in editing, just seconds off of a scene here, a scene there to move things along, but still, it's a strong film. And ponder on the fact that in this movie the young generation have a lot to learn (including beautiful Charlize Theron) from the "" oldies "". Charlize Theron isn't in her element playing a Queens - chick, but aside from a faltering accent, she does pretty well. All the players capture the essence of the New York middle class gestalt beautifully. James Caan is one of the best at playing the small - time racketeer and he nails it again with his portrayal of the dirty dealing supplier."
2472,"Next Friday is actually pretty funny even though it lacks the film's first scene stealer Chris Tucker. This one was not as funny but did have some really funny moments and was overall a fun and entertaining film. The "" biches "" (Joker's women) were very hot, and Lisa Rodriguez had a smart female character, something not seen much in movies like these. However, there are some seriously funny things that you can't help but laugh at. Next Friday may not be as good as the first or third Friday movie but it is still funny and worth watching."
2482,"Willie Is bullied by three schoolmates and his only friend is his older neighbor Dink Jenkins (Luke Wilson), who is a baseball player and idol of the town. In 1942, a 10 - year - old boy who is more intellectual than athletic and is constantly teased by others finds solace in the puppy given to him on his birthday. Being that magazine is pretty Liberal, you get Liberal slants in the movie (racial and anti-war sentiments) but nothing heavy - handed. When Dink goes to Europe fight in World War II, Willie is alone again. Frankie Muniz, from Fox's "" Malcolm in the Middle "" on TV, is very effective and well cast."
2483,"The reaction from everyday viewers mirrored this reception, with mostly negative comments right here on IMDb. There are thoughtful subtexts about giving oneself over to a "" feel - good "" substance, "" survival of the fittest "" evolution, and cyclical regeneration. The "" fountain of youth "" device is intriguing, and even though the "" Ninth Dimension "" stuff is gobbledy - gook, it's good gobbledy - gook--it makes some sense as fantasy material, and it provides a lot of suspense. James Spader's characterization of Nick Vanzant is nice and complex. And the rest of the cast is at least decent, even if Peter Facinelli overacts a bit towards the end--but the role calls for that."
2509,"Yet another Freddie Prinze Jnr - lead teen romance comedy about two college students, Alec (Prinze Jnr) and Imogen (Julia Stiles, Save The Last Dance) who fall in love, and experience the highs and lows of being in a serious relationship. Yes "" Down to You "" has it's cute moments, some funny moment, and few sweet moment, but worth 7 bucks? Compared to the other three major teen romance flicks of the year (Loser, Whatever it Takes, Boys and Girls) Down to You is indeed one of the finest. Henry Winkler gives a comic performance as Prinze's celebrity - chef father and Zak Orth plays Prinze's "" friend turned porn - star - friend "" with gutso. The film is more of a "" love story "" then most recent teen flicks dealing mainly with "" physical attraction "" or "" opposites attract ""."
3017,"The original Urban Legends was okay - not great, just entertaining. The whole film is exceptionally dumb and doesn't really have anything to do with urban legends, with the exception of a tacked on waking up in a bathtub missing a kidney scene, but Jennifer Morrison is cute and does a good job with this material. With many veiled references to Alfred Hitchcock's films, the filmmakers may have thought they were honoring the great director but in reality the idea is so poorly done that they only come across as cheap rip - offs. All in all, Urban Legends: Final Cut is worth the time, but it is still not as good as the original, which was also not even that great. It was really funny in some places and the black security guard was a hoot baby!"
2513,"He ably plays straight man (hmm), setting up her best bits, and pitching lines to the fabulous Stockard Channing. Some were minor parts, but all did an excellent job. Nathan Lane is great as Mansfield and Stockard Channing (as her best friend) and David Hyde Pierce (as her publisher) are hysterical and offer strong support. Paul Rudnick, who wrote this, can be extremely funny, as his script for Addams Family Values demonstrates."
2803,"The premise is a funny one, right off the bat these two are good at what they do, but are looked upon as mere screw - ups, by their employers, well at least Chan's Boss looked at him that way. Good action scenes, some solid humor, fun characters and nice cinematography are all the pluses. Wilson is as impressive an actor as he is a writer--he shares writing credits on such films as "" Rushmore "" and "" The Royal Tenenbaums . "" This duo when they came together was another one of those,' fresh - eyed' originals. Saloons, brothels and even wilderness settings are used with great success."
2545,"Ghostface returns he has unfinished business with Sidney and he wants her back. The story is set three years after Scream 2 Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), who has gone into self - imposed isolation following the events of the previous two films is drawn to Hollywood yet again she returns again to face the past and find out who is responsible for her mother's death. Courtney Cox is excellent as always as Gale Weathers. Other players such as Parker Posey, Emily Mortimer and Scott Foley as members of the film - within - a - film join the three original cast members (with a brief cameo by Jamie Kennedy as Randy Meeks with posthumous advice to survive a trilogy). You can easily predict the timing of the phone calls and the murders."
2548,"Fortunately, for movie audiences around the world, his talent for acting on the big screen has superseded and today he is known as one of the finest thespians in show business. Their scenes together are some of the best moments of the film. Jose Zuniga and Micahel DeLorenzo are hilarious as a pair of gay drug dealers."
2551,"The whole thing looks great and DiCaprio's star power and charisma helps keep the audience with him, it's just that the actual story doesn't quite have the rich feeling or depth that the tourist - film location does. Still, the most important thing about Richard, Zeph and Sammy is intact. DiCaprio shows on his face how successful he is when he did the film, and he is a show - off. In it's first week of release, enough people paid to see The Beach to cover over 3/4 of Leonardo DiCaprio's paycheque for his first major role since 1997's Titanic, and it would be safe to say that the majority of those paying customers were disappointed. Richard and two friends (Virginie Ledoyen and Guillaume Canet) he meets in Thailand risk their lives travelling secret that is dubbed the beach resort for those who don't like beach resorts."
2552,"This is a totally enjoyable film for people of all ages from the creators of the brilliant Adventures of Pete and Pete. If you're willing to open yourself up to this concept, that a snow day is a magical wonderful time when anything can happen, you'll probably enjoy this fun feel good movie. The magic the snowday brings to the characters in this movie is believable - the guy gets the right girl, the dad gets his job back and the kids get their snowdays! there are several storylines in the movie and each one equally interesting. The kids taking over the snow plow man's truck and creating an additional snowday is great!"
2553,"The songs are original and funny, and even have subtle references that older viewers will catch (they are NOT inappropriate in any way) and younger ones will miss, which allows many age levels to enjoy it. Can his friends help him find his direct relatives while teaching him the real definition of friends and family?"
2558,"The way the company keeps their brokers hungry is by encouraging excessive spending, such as luxury cars, so they have to make even more money to keep up with the lifestyle. Giovanni Ribisi makes a good appearance, and Nia Long needs to be in more movies. They gamble constantly, they party constantly; drugs, women and cars. The film really captures the desires of society and gives them a face. Giovanni Ribisi plays the good guy here, Scott Caan plays a young and wealthy broker that uses his wealth and power as a way to let go of his anger by constantly getting into physical altercations."
2559,"There were some surprise performances as well. Ryan, Keaton, Kudrow and Matthau pore on the charm and play off each other nicely."
2560,"While most movies that pit humans against horrendous extra terrestrials end up being cheap imitations of the' Aliens' series, Pitch Black stands as a fine piece of Sci - Fi, and an excellent movie all around. If you don't normally watch SF movies this is definitely one to consider, and if you like SF horror this is a must see - in fact true horror buffs might find it tame. The performances are uniformly superb - Radha Mitchell shows Fry steeling herself for leadership, overcoming her own fears, and trying to prevent further bloodshed, while Cole Hauser, as the man taking Riddick back to custody, shows he has his own agenda and his own idiosyncratic standards. They've got long, horizontal heads like a hammerhead, the quick - moving agility of the aliens, and the stealth of a Predator."
2561,"and it's just great when you can find a movie nowadays where you can't predict the ending cause everything is possible to happen. And it's the little, seemingly insignificant things he brings to the character that give the film that extra something and creates some memorable moments. The film's humor is occasionally too silly for words, but the cast is good and full of enthusiasm â€” especially Peet â€” and the script throws out a lot of unexpected twists and turns at just the right moments. Oz Oseransky is a mild - mannered affable dentist whose life is in flux when his trampy French accented wife Sophie (Arquette in full blown voluptuosness) decides she wants to end their marriage. THE WHOLE NINE YARDS (2000) ** Matthew Perry, Bruce Willis, Natasha Henstridge, Amanda Peet, Michael Clarke Duncan, Rosanna Arquette, Kevin Pollak, Harlan Williams."
2563,It was hard to watch the needles in the beginning. Schools and drug awareness programs should use this film!
2572,"There are so many logic problems with it that there is absolutely no point in going into detail. Director Frankenheimer and screenwriter Kruger also seem to know what the audience wants from this sort of movie, and they fill it with everything they can, including violent action, the dark humor, the twists and turns, as well as a good dose of sex and nudity, provided mostly by Charlize Theron. And you, Ben, you will play it for laughs: you are in a comedy. The prison sequence was very well done and Affleck is immediately identifiable as the likable car jacker. If you love movies with a bunch of twists, this is a wonderful movie."
2573,""" Wonder Boys "" is one of the best movies of recent years in that it successfully drags the viewer along on it's whimsical and sometimes really strange journey. throw in an eccentric writing protege (Tobey Maguire), Tripp's bi-sexual literary agent (Robert Downey, Jr.) and his transvestite date, and you've got quite an interesting mix of characters. Douglas is pulling off what must be his best performance ever, portraying a decaying, once - famous addict writer with a severe case of reversed writer's block: he can't finish his novel and he can't stop writing. Grady deals with everything this peculiar weekend shows him - with a calm voice and an attitude mellowed from either age or experience or pot. He smokes weed and lives with a student of his (Katie Holmes), he is in the midst of his third divorce and is in love with his married boss, Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand), and that second novel is forever incomplete, and has been for seven years."
2575,"Will Ferrell absolutely steals the movie with his part as the creepy funeral director who laughs inappropiately, has trouble with the right way to make eye contact, and is constantly having sexual trysts during the viewing. The plot is engaging and fast - paced; the movies doesn't even come close to the two - hour mark."
2576,"Story in one sentence: two best friends (one gay, one straight) end up in bed together, have a son, raise him together, everything hunky - dory until she wants to marry someone else and the little family gets screwed up. All in all, a good storyline put to a bad script and bad performances. He is then - on top of everything - blamed with ruining Madonna Â´s life. It is touching and funny, and might have suffered 9 years ago because the viewing public was not ready for the very realistic portrayal of these complicated questions about who is really "" family "" and why. The Next Best Thing casts Madonna as a free spirited soul (some stretch of casting there) who has a one night stand with an old friend and soul mate Rupert Everett."
2577,"Others will probably enjoy more than a few good laughs. And the depictions of their planet is interesting, but most of it revolves around a classroom environment. This cute and entertaining comedy stars Garry Shandling as an alien sent to earth to impregnate a woman and bring the baby back to his planet. The opening scenes of the aliens being educated on the female erogenous zones are quite amusing as is Shandling's explanations of women to aliens when he returns to his planet after impregnating Bening and stealing the baby. Greg Kinnear scores as a slimy co-worker of Shandling's and Linda Fiorentino makes the most of her brief appearance as his sexy wife."
2595,"What truly makes this movie stand above others of its ilk is the great acting of the characters. If a little subtlety were mixed into just a few scenes this movie would have stood out as one of the greatest and lasting human dramas in science fiction history. Movies like Wing Commander have great graphics, but the story line and acting leave you back at the ticket booth. Could possibly be one of the best spacewalk scenes in films to date. DePalma's talent for filming suspenseful action sequences is in full swing in this film."
2631,"And largely why she triumphs is her partnership with an intelligent and decent lawyer in Ed Masry. Other than that, it was a good movie - great performances and a wonderful story. Besides the real Brockavich, the real Ed Masry comes on the DVD bonus, and shows how good the casting of Albert Finney, and his acting, are and how much he contributed to the successful outcome of EB's efforts. Albert Finney also brings some of his quiet to Ed Masry and in turn is able to ground her when things get rough near the end--he and Roberts light up the screen whenever they are together without having any sexual tension, leaving it all to their acting styles. everybody should be proud of soderbergh for realizing what a huge hero Erin Brockovich is and for bringing her struggles and triumphs to the screen."
2632,"' Final Destination' started off very promising especially before and during Alex's vision, and Devon Sawa does a great job. Once on the plane Alex begins to experience a dream - like vision of the jet exploding in midair killing all of its passengers. Devon Sawa, no stranger to movies, is perfect at playing the lead role of the troubled Alex. Well, Devon Sawa stars as Alex who along with his High School classmates are heading to France. If you decide to watch it, try to enjoy it for what it is, but keep your expectations low."
2667,"The wild action scenes, fairly involving story and nice colors and interesting sound track all make this movie a cut above the normal martial arts fare. It manages to be a romantic film without being sappy and stupid, it manages to be an action film where the action rocks but isn't too over-the-top, and it manages to make good use of the Shakesphere story, ROMEO AND JULIET while still respecting the themes and the humor. jet Li rocks, and this film was great. In her first feature movie, Aaliyah is absolutely breath taking as Trish O'Day. Sure, it's silly, but it's never boring, there are some slick fight scenes, and the soundtrack is pretty neat."
2668,"Rich boy meets poor girl in' Mabels Diner' who is a waitress and local boy friend gets very upset and a fight starts out. Leelee Sobieski was a good choice for Samantha. Along comes Kelley (Chris Klein), the smart (valedictorian) rich kid who is stuck on himself, the last person Sam's sister and parents want her to get mixed up with. Josh Hartnett is excellent as the unpolished bumpkin, Leelee as the philosophical girl looking for meaning in her short life. Goes joy - riding nonetheless, and stops in the diner on the wrong side of the tracks for a quick argument with the local yokels."
2669,"The story is fairly simple, unpopular guy (Shane West) is in love with hottest girl in the school (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe). Whatever It Takes is a sometime enjoyable and sometime funny teen comedy with a reused plot and many teen comedy cliches. It's up there w / Win a Date w / Tad Hamitlon & In Good Company. Perhaps there's a new software product called InstaScript that's selling big in Hollywood. Note the wardrobe department will save extra dollars with costumes that use minimal fabric to clothe the star females."
2671,"Yes, the story of an up and coming politician falling in love with a beautiful, left - wing activist is a bit trite but no more so than the 70's in which they shared their life together were naive, idealistic and a necessary part of the evolution of American social conscience. Her ability to convey the sentiment of her beliefs in anger and love is nothing short of inspiring. Aside of great individual performances, the overall chemistry between Sara and Fielding was tangible, necessary and believable, as this is a story about love and why true love is endless. Waking The Dead is so crammed with genuine performances from the ensemble that if you allow yourself an immersion in Billy Crudup's confusion, you cannot help but think about those who perhaps you have lost and what they mean to you now; both Crudup and Connelly exude dedication, and one key scene stands out as an exemplar of acting technique coupled with intuitive choices; in his director's commentary, Keith Gordon reveals himself to be the sort of guy you'd like to know, not only for his direct honesty, but simply because he's fun to listen to"
2691,"At his best, like in movies such as THE SURE THING, SAY ANYTHING, THE GRIFTERS, BULLETS OVER BROADWAY, GROSSE POINT BLANK, and this, he plays people on the cusp of growing up, who are able to if they want to, but aren't sure if they want to, and yet he's made each of them different. Love, life, relationships, music, movies, hobbies, jobs, ticks, ups, downs - everything is here. "" High Fidelity "" is perfect if you already had a broken heart, and if you tried to heal it with some pop songs."
2692,"Dreamworks is a breath of fresh air in times like these, it would seem. Tulio, the other half of the duo, has a bit more preoccupation with material possessions and wealth, though he still remains human. Then there's Chel; the seducer from the city of gold, able to help the two (at a price). The Road To El Dorado is a fun film from Dreamworks. The animation is stunning, the backgrounds are colourful, the colours are vibrant and the character movements are sharp."
2693,"; there's no graphic gore (or nudity); and the action scenes are well - done and exciting. A father and son are members of the skulls a secret fraternity that likes to prove the courage of its members by starting wars. Though it poses a good moral dilemma, ` Skulls' is presented in such an implausible way as to render it crippled at birth. The deleted scenes included on the DVD are also worth watching, but you understand why they were cut. He gets great support from Paul Walker (` She's All That', ` Varsity Blues') as Caleb Mandrake, the spoiled rich kid trying to step out of his father's shadow."
2714,"This movie will make you laugh, get a little misty in the eyes, and you won't even notice the time. Dennis Quaid is excellent, this is his best movie in years. The movie deals very well with how they change the future back and forth. Speaking of the characters--Quaid and Caviezel both do great work. Caviezel brings a subtle sadness to the character, a quality one might expect from someone whose life hasn't quite worked out quite as well as it might have, possibly due to a void created by the absence of his father."
2715,"Arquette, Caan, and Platt make a nice trio, and Martin Landau is hilarious as an old - school wrestling guru. This was light and enjoyable film of two affable wrestling fans who want to reinstate a recently fallen hero to the top of the WCW world. The act of watching this movie is as painful as the countless hits to the crotch the filmmakers thought were so amusing. Their nights are spent in a convenience store parking lot jawing with junior high school students."
2716,"Duchovny and Driver have a very cute, chaste relationship that you can't help getting involved in. If you love David Duchovny and want to see him in something different than your usual alien hunting FBI agent, see this movie. He had the best performance in this movie because it was greatly different from others he has done. This is an excellent setup containing thoroughly developed characters, a clear dramatic premise, emotional and physical conflicts, and an unusual structure. This is one of the most effective, if somewhat formulaic, comedy - dramas this year."
2717,"Marines are entrenched on the roof while crowd is raging beyond, targeted by some sporadic fire. Colonel played by S. L. Jackson is doing his best to have situation run smoothly. Cynical foes of American freedom do count on the soft - heartedness of the people who let others fight for them to do their defaming for them. Jackson's military hero is self evidently anything but, and Jones's about - to - retire - in - two - weeks - lawyer straight from a cupboard in central casting (the shelf below the about - to - retire - in - two - weeks detective). The performances of Tommy Lee Jones, Samuel L. Jackson and Guy Pearce were very good."
2732,"When Bullock's character realises that this (the pills and drugs) was not a way to live, and Mortensen addresses her insecurities of not being able to do a single thing right, the film touches significant depths and strikes the chords of viewers. The extras are primarily a "" making of "" HBO special, plus the actual soap opera "" Santa Cruz "" which was made especially for this film, and has a recurring presence in it. Viggo Mortensen is endearing as the other guy for Gwen. In fact, the film's best moments are when Thomas does this - in a series of flashbacks to let the audience get in sync and depth with Bullock's character. It has its funny moments, so it's not entirely drama."
2733,""" Patrick Bateman lives in a morally flat world in which clothes have more value than skin, objects are worth more than bones, and the human soul is something to be sought with knives and hatchets and drills . "" "" You could describe â€˜ American Psycho' as a film about perfect surfaces and what might be lurking beneath, "" says Mary Harron. The director's cut is available on videocassette and DVD, which shows the film's three - way sex scene in more disturbing, yet innovative, detail. The production design, the cinematography, the visual effects, the engaging soundtrack, the quirks each actor masterfully incorporates with their character, and every other aspect of the film is flush in detail. Christian Bale gives a flawless performance as the troubled, deep down wannabe Yuppie who has psychotic, violent impulses."
2734,"Now, after many years of separation, Anna (Jenna Elfman) returns and both men fall immediately and madly in love with her. The film is chock full of religious humor and sharp - witted dialogue that keeps you grinning between guffaws. The romance is syrupy sweet and the actors have such great chemistry that it is easy to believe they have been friends all their lives. Besides there are a brief exploration about Jewish way of life, making a slight exposition of the rites, ceremonies, habits, religion and the Tora. Although the screenplay sounds some ridiculous and absurd, the plot is well developed and has surprises and its good moments here and there."
2735,"For admirers of quality movies, one of the greatest sources of frustration has always been the inverse ration that exists between movies that are good and movies that make money. The result is that wonderful little films are almost invariably squeezed out of the marketplace, left to languish in obscure art houses scattered in a few major cities, while bloated, mindless multi-million dollar monstrosities fill sprawling megaplexes found in cities, suburbs and rural areas stretching literally from coast to coast. Set in a small Oregon town (though the film was, rather inexplicably, filmed in the environs of Montreal), the movie stars the superb Linda Fiorentino and Dermot Mulroney as long time high school sweethearts who have married right after graduation, found their comfortable little niche in the small world they inhabit and now begun to take each other for granted. The early scenes of the film are wickedly funny as Fiorentino, suspicious that her new patient may just be faking it, plays a clever little game of cat - and - mouse to try to catch him in his impressive charade. Fiorentino and Mulroney are thoroughly believable as a couple of once - edgy youngsters grown into responsible, comfortable but slightly restless adults."
2737,"The film mostly sidelines the Pistols' notoriously self - aggrandising manager Malcolm McLaran to concentrate on the band members themselves. There are also moments of genuine sadness, for example when Lydon talks about his friend, the late Sid Vicious. Temple tells this story through accounts given to him by the still living Sex Pistols, as the opposing side to his other Sex Pistols film, Great Rock and Roll Swindle, which was told to him by the Sex Pistols manager, Malcolm McLaren. Footage is shown of the band during a children's benefit show and the band members are seen playing with and talking to the kids with huge smiles on their faces, their joy at being at the event evident. The best scenes are when the band hurled green on the hook - nosed heroin addict from the New Musical Express who was responsible for starting the media's hate campaign."
2738,"The primary problem with the movie is that Demi is living out two lives, neither one of which - quite honestly - are all that interesting, and which, as a result, don't make for particularly interesting viewing. Demi Moore (looking angular and pale like Courteney Cox - Arquette, yet more flexible) is very fine as a woman living parallel lives, one of which is a dream - world. There is a lot of truth about relationships revealed here. Moore's fascinating screen presence keeps this movie going even when it sags terribly in the middle, and Ronald Bass' script makes such a compelling argument for both of her lives that it's very difficult to guess for yourself what the outcome will be. William Fichtner was not the greatest choice for her NY love interest."
2749,"The acting is pretty good, especially from the three leads - Lena Headey (Cathy), James Marsden (Derrick) and Norman Reedus (Travis). Both Marsden and Reedus are better actors than they are given credit for. In fact, the film is worth seeing for its locales alone. A good film can go far in the changing of perceptions, attitudes, even actions of those who watch it. The plot begins with three college friends, Cathy (Lena Headey, "" The Devil's Advocate, "") Derek (James Marsden, "" Disturbing Behavior, "") and Travis (Norman Reedus, "" Deuces Wild, "") who find they are very good at starting rumors."
2750,"L&B is real, engaging, and enjoyable. This movies is mind - blowing, excellent, heart - rising and down to earth. The story is very well written and works on several levels - it refuses to be pinned down as simply a romance or drama, choosing instead a careful blending of different elements. The basketball scenes are well shot and pretty realistic in the aspect of how male and female teams are viewed by the fans. Unlike "" He Got Game "" (another very good film), which dwells solely on the negative aspects of the sport - hustlers, hookers, drugs and death, L&B concentrates on the positive things in life and basketball serves as the background rather than the focus."
2751,"But U-571 makes everything seem sweet: there is no claustrophobia, the crew gets along pretty well, they kill every german in sight, and even a destroyer. There is an undeniable and deep love and respect for all veterans and U. S. soldiers that lost their lives in Europe during both World Wars from the rest of the world, the kind of respect that only comes from defending an ideal with their lives. There were some tremendous daring - do escapades with memorable victories. Where U-571 plays glorious fanfare, Das Boot counters with powerful silence. The german U-571 is seriously damaged, so that the full, perfectly trained german crew is n`t able to run it."
2755,"The first Crow, which is best known for being the film in which Brandon Lee was killed (duh), is a cult classic directed by Alex "" Dark City "" Proyas, and even today, it is regarded as probably the greatest of the gothic / action / modern noir films. Eric Mabius as the central character shines throughtout. There is some strong talent in the cast for a direct - to - video feature and the young leads of Mabius and Dunst {."
2756,"The few things done right first: Jane Krakowski makes a wonderful Betty; why couldn't she have been in the first movie? The animals were a really nice touch such as dino (Blanc) a massaging squid (O'Donell) and more. This one had decent performances, really excellent art direction, and some really cool FX. Fred and Barney dress up as dancers: they even manage to ruin this classic comedy routine. They are the first ones Gazoo sees after he lands on the planet, so he decides to follow them around, even though he annoys them."
2757,"Time passes, and Portman experiences life, love, triumph, tragedy and everything in between as she makes the small Oklahoma town her own. When Novalee makes a rest stop at a Wal - Mart in Oklahoma, he ditches her, literally leaving her there barefoot and pregnant. The only thing that eclipses the intense emotions you feel in this movie are the performances turned out by a perfectly assembled group of some of the finest actors out there. The character development of Novalee is excellent, although Director Matt Williams could have spent more time on some of the supporting characters, especially Sister Husband (Stockard Channing). Stockard Channing plays the unforgettable "" Sister Husband "" who takes the young girl and her newborn child in, and Sally Fields makes a momentary appearance as the young girl's absentee mother, one of the highlights of the film."
2759,"A film that Brasilian Americans can be proud of instead of ashamed of like they were at the pathetic Anaconda from summer's past. Rio, on the other hand, is a city filled with unique beauty, as anyone who has ever been to Sugarloaf or Corcavado can attest to. The movie is perfect: the story is very good, the actors and actresses are playing wonderful ropes and the music. Her timid interplay with Faguendes (Pedro Paul) was sweet and touching. Faguendes is obviously a well - known, beloved actor in his home country."
2762,"But none of this detracts from a truly great achievement from all involved - for actors to go 93 minutes undisturbed is very impressive. This type of format does--at points--feel like a theatrical version of a "" Big Brother "" episode, but Figgis wrote a story with as much intriguing elements as he can possibly fit into a film of this scope. Of course, the process gets tiresome and repetitive at times, but overall it's a pretty fascinating work that will probably be better appreciated by the more open - minded moviegoer--as opposed to mainstream viewers who will probably view this as just plain weird. If you watch all these behind - the - scenes specials with actors stumbling line - after - line, doing take - after - take, until they finally get it right the 100th time--it's astounding to see that the whole cast was able to pull this off without a scratch. And then to have such a dramatic climax at the end of 93 improvised minutes is pretty mind - blowing."
2769,"Like Ben - Hur, this is a story of a successful man who loses everything thanks to an evil man, and then has to fight his way back up to seek revenge on that man and to obtain his freedom back. Luckily, in Ridley Scott's case, Russel Crowe is so captivating and convincing as a general loved by his troops and as a slave loved by the people that the movie really works. Possibly one of the greatest actors today, Crowe carries this epic film on his very capable shoulders. However, perhaps the two finest performances in the movie were given by a couple of acting veterans in supporting roles. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction."
2770,"The first hour of the film was a succession of Kodak moments depicting the romantic splendor of Africa and how idyllic it would be to live there. Although they showed the occasional storm and threatening wild animal, every effort was made to emphasize the positives. Many of the important dramatic scenes were not allowed to fully develop, giving a snippet and then cutting away to a completely unrelated scene. The scenes of dead elephants made the statement in a poignant way, much better than any dialogue could have. Kim Basinger was excellent as Kuki."
2771,"A noble thing to have, unless your naivety of heart gets you into places you never dreamed your heart would lead you. E. P. Beauchene In a nutshell, Mary, (Kristin Scott Thomas), a distractingly beautiful English widow has more heart than mind in this period piece. The only reason to see UP AT THE VILLA is the performances by a wonderful cast. if you can't get memorable performances out of this ` A List' then the problem with this movie must be blamed on pitiful direction and an inadequate script. Well, great costumes and a wonderful ` feel' for Pre WWII Italy."
2778,"The aliens are essentially just people with dreadlocks and slightly bigger, hairier hands with an extra finger and apparently they're also really stupid. Finally, stay true to the idiotic gibberish you based the film on in the first place, and you've got the makings of a rolling - on - the - floor comedy. In fact, opening night, in a packed theater, people started laughing out loud about 20 minutes into the film and never really stopped. Pretty good for a guy whose most advanced tools were sticks and rocks earlier in the film. 1 hour 50 minutes: Oooo goody the humans have come up with a plan to get rid of these incredibly stupid alien's."
2779,"Sappy, badly acted, full of exaggerated clichÃ©s and one - liner groaners, Center Stage nevertheless has a kind of charm to it. There's Charlie (Sascha Radetsky), the perfect good guy. By casting real dancers in a lot of the roles, Center Stage lends an air of credibility to the lavishly filmed dance sequences, clearly done with love by such talents as world - leading dancers Julie Kent and Ethan Stiefel (widely considered to be one of the best ballet dancers in the world) as well as relatively new talents such as Amanda Schull. But overall, the dance scenes are the best part of the movie, especially Cooper's ballet at the end. Some movies are great because they change your life or make you think."
2780,"It might be a tad funnier but both very rough comedies make you laugh--and isn't that enough sometimes? Norm MacDonald, plays the standard role, Dave Chappelle compliments him well, and Danny Devito plays his character as if he is the star of the show, and in many ways he is. There were some solid laughs too and seeing Dave Chappelle, Danny DeVito, and Norm McDonald all on the same screen was just baller, especially to look back on it now. By the way, if you liked this film, try watching another MacDonald film DIRTY WORK. However, "" Screwed "" has one major element that makes it effective: the movie induces some big laughs."
2781,"By setting the film deep in the heart of a very real and very modern steel and concrete American jungle like New York City, which is infused with the relics of the mass media and cold capitalistic consumerism, Almereyda powerfully enhances for the audience the sense of the desolation of his characters that results from urban isolation. His visually striking translation of scenes like Ophelia's drowning and Hamlet's famous ` to be or not to be' soliloquy are a delight and true brain candy. Using the text selectively, and moving it around, always runs the risk of seriously undermining Shakespeare's points and messages, and one therefore needs a tremendously detailed understanding of the text (and its best interpretations) in order to edit it sensibly. The cast is all around superb, with the classically delivered lines from actors Liev Schreiber (Laertes) and Sam Shepard (Ghost) nicely counterbalancing the very contemporary style of delivery from Ethan Hawk (Hamlet), Bill Murray (Polonius), and Julia Stiles (Ophelia). Also gone here is the sharply self - referential scenes of Hamlet lecturing the players."
2794,"The first act, which shows Aladar's arrival at the lemurs, is actually portrayed in a different, more detailed way than Tarzan's arrival at the apes, which is refreshing to see. Aladar's selfless attempts to save the dinosaur's are touching to watch as it reflects how the kind - hearted Plio raised him. The characters are quite all right too (especially Aladar, Zini and Eema), although the film focuses more to move the plot forward. Although CGI has already brought to life dinosaurs before in JURASSIC PARK and its sequel THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK, sometimes DINOSAUR has certainly improved from which it started from. The characters are enjoyable and the voice cast, that includes talents like Alfre Woodard, Joan Plowright and Ossie Davis do a fine job."
2795,"Amy Heckerling's latest teen comedy,' Loser', is an old - fashioned charmer where nice guys finish first, sweet girls end up making the right choices, and pushy' users' get their just desserts! It relies on little sex and profanity, but instead has its success rooted firmly in the acting and charisma of young stars Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari. His personality is a contrast to most people around him, particularly his roommates, who like to party all night and taunt Paul. Plotwise, it follows most other romantic comedy type movies. Paul is lonely and frustrated, which makes a simple act of kindness by fellow student Dora Diamond (Mena Suvari, in her best performance, to date) take on special significance to him."
2796,"Josh (Breckin Meyer) has loved Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard) since they were both five years old. His two best friends--resident prankster E. L. (Sean W. Scott) and stoner - intellectual Rubin (Paul Costanzo)--offer to come along, and help Josh persuade mega-nerd Kyle (D. J. Qualls) to let them use his father's car in exchange for a chance to come along for the ride. Not a movie for date night, but a good choice for gathering around the tube with bongs, brews, and bros. . Breckin Meyer might not had been the best choice for the main character but all the other characters are simply great to watch, especially DJ Qualls. Go on a road trip with his buddies [Seann William Scott, Paulo Costanzo, DJ Qualls] to get to the tape before it gets to her."
2797,"Add a gigolo (Hugh Grant), a couple of inept crooks, a couple of old - time Elaine favorites, Strich and May, and a pretty funny premise and you have some good entertainment and an underrated Allen film. In fact ` Sweet' was successful because the actor (Sean Penn) was able to convey a Woody that had some natural skill, who in his heart knew he was secondrate, and who also had publicly criticized eccentricities. Along the way, Tracy Ullman, Elaine Stritch, and - especially - Elaine May all give scene - stealing performances. Though essentially a time - marking throwaway by writer / director Woody Allen, ` Small Time Crooks' provides so many gems of performance that one can overlook the film's derivative plotting and overall lack of comic drive. She matches Allen laugh - for - laugh in here and, in some respects, even steals the show."
2802,Thandie Newton is attractive heroine and Dougray Scott is satisfactory as the main villain. More realism in that 40 minutes would have made this a far better film than it turned out to be. See him perform the most wicked stunts ever done by amateur stunt men! John Woo must have thought of the elements he needed to follow up the solid thrills of the original movie. The robbery of the disease is a pale shadow of the original film's robbery scene and the final motorbike chase is good but only a hint of what Woo has done before.
2816,"The talented comic helps keep the movie togehter, with a little assistance from the supporting cast. Paul Giamatti, who was great as Pig Vomit in the acclaimed "" Private Parts, "" is funny as Lawrence's partner. "" Big Momma "" doesn't deliver the biggest laughs, but it's good, fun entertainment on a lonely weekday afternoon. STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs A lot of people have slammed Big Momma's House, but, appreciated on it's own levels, it's fairly enjoyable. There are some inventive laughs in the plot, Martin Lawrence is an effective comic performer as he had proved before in the excellent Bad Boys, although perhaps a little too crude and self styled in places."
2876,"gone in 60 seconds is a very good action comedy film that made over $100 million but got blasted by most critics. Dominic Sena, whose career has mostly consisted of directing commercials, has an appealing style and a decisive attitude in "" Gone in 60 Seconds "" which will grant audiences with two hours of commotion, thrills, and excitement The story was believable and has probobly the greatest cast ever for this type of movie including 3 academy award winners nicolas cage, robert duvall and the very hot anjolina jolie. At its heart, this film is about cars. But the film has style and a good pace, with some great theft scenes, well - spotted humor, and a final chase that (while not among the greatest ever filmed) is certainly a wild ride."
2878,"His adaptations of Shakespeare will undoubtedly be his lasting contribution to the history of film, and this is no exception. What really makes this a must - see though is how the text is broken up into easily digestible chunks, interspersed with classic musical numbers from the 1930s. The costumes and art direction are appropriately light and beautiful, and some of the comedy moments are quite fun. Alessandro Nivola (Laurel Canyon, Mansfield Park) is the best singer, Adrian Lester (Primary Colors) the best dancer, Branagh the best actor, and Matthew Lillard (Scooby - Doo).Â .Â . sure is tall. Busby Berkeley would have loved it, as would those guys like Cole Porter, Irving Berlin and Vincent Youmans who wrote those songs back in the 30s."
2879,", Ms. Watson rattles off these lines without a trace of affectation or laugh calculation, which makes them work so beautifully. Watson's tour - de-force is in playing Trixie completely straight, malapropisms and all. Ms. Watson is certainly a versatile actress, and her Trixie is a marked departure from her other movie portrayals--especially her most recent in "" Angela's Ashes "". Her timing is perfect and Ms. Watson's performance is endearing. The aforementioned Ms. Warren turns in her usual strong performance."
2905,"Carrey plays 2 characters here - 1 (Charlie Baileygates) is a little funny, but the second (Hank) brings out one of Carrey's best performances yet. Its not all about Carrey though and some of the best moments come from his three sons. The best scenes include the hilarious sex scenes, and Carrey's kids, who are straight A black guys who curse in every other sentence and yell German at each other. Jim Carrey's comedy antics (not seen this good in 3 years) makes a come back thanks to the Farrelly brothers (Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary) who make their 2nd collaboration. The main treat is to watch Carrey transform from the sweet natured Charlie to the vulgar, Dirty Harry sounding Hank."
2900,"Freddie Prinze Jr. and Claire Forlaini have wonderful chemistry and are fun to watch (especially in the dance club scene). Each character has their own unique quirks that make the viewing experience that much more enjoyable. The interactions of these two characters is the classic example of not getting along as kids but falling in love as adults. Ryan's best friend and Jennifer's best friend are played by Jason Biggs and Amanda Detmer with whimsical freedom. Boys and Girls has an engaging story that makes the audience connect, emotionally, with the problems of the main characters."
2901,"Samuel L. Jackson seems to be having the time of his movie acting life portraying the title character in ` Shaft,' John Singleton's take on the groundbreaking classic that, on its release in 1971, served as the blueprint for all the ` blaxploitation' films that filled theatres throughout the early and mid 1970's. While the trailers and commercials for this movie made it look really good, this movie itself is a POS that is openly racist against white people and the plot itself is nothing more than African American revenge. Samuel L. Jackson is truly a great Shaft, he's probably the only actor out there (besides the great Richard Roundtree) who could pull this off, and he does an excellent job. In an overly reverent gesture to the original film, he brings back Richard Roundtree (the original Shaft) as the current Shaft's (Samuel L. Jackson) uncle and mentor. This Shaft is a great movie for anyone who's a fan of the original, Sam Jackson, or great action movies in general."
2902,"(If anything, they look more simple) This film, as cliched as the story was, was visually inspired. This film should make a great addition to any enthusiast's DVD library. The story goes places and uses the chosen technology very nicely. And the 2D animation mixes so well with the 3D animation - it just adds to the thrill of the movie. The scenes in the movie are exceptional - from the ice rings scene with the reflections to the wake angels scene in space."
2904,"Movie buffs can try to count the references to The Great Escape, Stalg 17, Star Trek and Braveheart and may be pleasantly surprised at the quality of the camera work. Full of wit, sight gags, homage to prison escape movies, yet completely adorable and exciting to even very young children, this movie has everything you would want in a movie. However, the filmmakers make this movie feel original, fresh, suspenseful, and involving, regardless if the main characters are chickens with patriotic instincts. But the sound of laughter, cheers and applause from the whole audience as the chickens make their final bid for freedom is well worth the wait. Regardless of how well crafted it is or how artful the material, the movie is about chickens escaping out of their pen in order to find genuine independence."
2906,"One newspaper accused it of blackening the character of the British officer Banastre Tarleton who served as the inspiration for the villainous Colonel Tavington. Some major battle scenes, some drama, the obvious patriotism, some decent acting,. The wide - open vistas and battle scenes were breath - taking and beautifully filmed."
2907,"First of all, it should be noted that the film makers here had respect and affection for the source material, and it shows. Rather than just enticing audiences with known characters and titles, then assaulting you with a worthless script (as happens all too often in TV show "" adaptations ""), this movie pays due homage to the irreverent satire that was the original Rocky & Bullwinkle cartoon, by staying close to its theme. The oaf super spies from Potsalvania, Boris and Natasha are here, as is their "" Fearless Leader . "" On top of that, several celebs drop by for some clever cameos, in a "" Muppet Movie "" style way. Movies that aren't serious can be really fun, this one however is an exception from that statement."
2908,"Based on Sebastian Junger's best - seller, Petersen's motion picture relates the well known true story of six brave fishermen who really fought for survival with all their heart, skill and tenacity Though it is easy to mistake the real life heroes (the Coast Guard operatives who saved so many lives during that storm) for the heroes of the film, the crew of the Andrea Gayle and their loved ones are the real heroes here - in their valiant efforts to save themselves, their boat, and their catch. Combine all of this with the best special effects imaginable, outstanding performances, and a terrific score by John Horner, and you're in for the thrill of a lifetime. The performances and the script are strong and the characters very well realized (though fictionalized). It is a terrifying adventure with thrilling images: The shark attack on the deck of the Gail; Captain Tyne's exploits while trying to repair a broken mast; the remarkable bravery of a chopper crew riding the scary waves to save three lives trapped on a small luxury yacht; and the mid-air refueling attempt for a rescue helicopter thwarted by strong winds"
2926,"It is a feel good mid-life movie, a bit sappy and some scenes work less well than others (why does the kid stay with Bruce Willis after he knows his Mom is dying?) The Kid - At 39 years old Russel Duritz has a life that most men would envy - he has a great job, is respected (and feared), has a beautiful house and makes buckets of money. True, young children may not fully grasp the idea of growing up and having all your dreams fizzle away, but it leaves a great impact on the adults and parents of those children. His acclaim, he is Russell Duritz, he knows what it takes to make it. The Kid is a really good family movie about a stuffy image consultant, Russ Duritz, who has lots of money, a good job, nice house, etc. ."
2927,"Friday the 13th, He Knows You Are Alone, Black Christmas, Psycho, etc. . Although the movie Scream was in fact a great movie, everyone knows that most horror movies are rather laughable. Some of the slapstick and sight gags do fall flat, but the movie is quick paced and the satire is fun. In its opening stretches, ` Scary Movie' has a great deal of fun parodying the many ludicrous conventions that have long defined these films: the use of 30 - year old actors to portray empty - headed, nubile adolescents; the heavy emphasis on teen sexuality and partial nudity; the inane actions of the killer's victims who seem to do everything possible to hurl themselves into dangerous situations; and the oh - so - predictable false scare (usually caused by a leaping cat) followed immediately by the inevitable killer's attack. Like most movie parodies, ` Scary Movie' starts out well then begins to head downhill as it exhausts the possibilities of its limited material."
2932,"Performances are generally strong, and some of the use of sound is superb, such as when the main protagonist is' coming up'. Some characters abstain, some overdo it and pay the price {though like Human Traffic there are refreshingly no deaths or serious fatalities}, most just enjoy themselves. These intimate underground parties are truly a positive unifying force; bringing all sorts of people together through music. "" Party Girl "" was a pretty cool take on the New York scene of several years ago, but still failed to capture the true passionate essence of THE PARTY itself. the subtle, grateful acknowledgement from a party - goer who's spirts were lifted by the party."
2935,""" X-Men "" is a rare treat--a blockbuster that lives up to its hype and a comic book adaptation that hits the mark. "" X-Men "" is smart, stylish, and very cool. The X-Men comics, which originated in the 1960s, are more politically progressive and morally complex than older superhero stories such as "" Superman "" where the heroes are always right, and truth, justice, and the American Way always prevail. Some of the dialogue is fairly cheesy, but in the hands of Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart it sounds quite convincing. Hard - core fans of the comics have complained about the omission of several popular X-Men."
2936,"There is one jaw - dropping thing Buck says when he visits Charlie and Carlyn at their home. This is truly one of those rare instances where you could see why people decide to make films. Nothing is handed to you right away, as the story develops, you are shown more and more until the utter power of this film is hanging on your own shoulders. This is a thrilling tale, and it is difficult to see it as the comedy that IMDb has labeled. This is not a film for everyone, but if chosen to explore will reveal some thickly layered characters with superb acting by Mr. White."
2938,"A good old - fashioned scary movie, avoiding irony and self - referentialism at every turn, this film relies on a nice premise and some well - executed creepy atmosphere for its impact. By the finale, so many gimmicks are being thrown at the screen, it just becomes an upscale B - flick. Robert Zemeckis does a fine job of building suspense and keeping the audience just a little off - balance (in spite of the spoilers in the trailers); in combination with Pfeiffer's acting, one is never quite sure whether Claire Spencer is deranged, possessed, or calculating. And, the film does have its humorous moments as well; Diane Scarwid helps to lighten things up as Claire's somewhat ditzy friend Jody, and Zemeckis has some fun with some of the backdrops in the quaint New England towns (a Vermont town named Adamant? The acting is near perfection, Michelle Pfeiffer deserves an Academy Award for her brilliant and masterful performance, but Harrison Ford surprisingly takes a back seat for most of the film, until the last 30 minutes, where his character really breaks out into something evil, Claire discovers why Norman has been trying to keep his secret for so long."
2953,"It is stunning that in this day and age of movie tie - ins, that the creators (or better said owners) of the Thomas the Tank Engine franchise couldn't find a better major movie outlet for their goldmine. This is the most popular character for children ages 2 - 6. Either if it was narrated by Beatles' drummer, Ringo Starr in the U. K. version, or by comedian, George Carlin in the American version, the show was, and still continues to be a wide success among aging toddlers. The gold dust emergency happens to coincide with the apparent return of a diesel engine intent on destroying steam engines."
2954,"Eddie Murphy is an exceptionally talented man - no doubts. Maybe one day he'll land a role like Alec Guiness in' Kind Hearts and Coronets' (Barry Norman's favourite film btw). Quoting from the intelligent character that Bruce Willis played in' The Kid', Russ Duritz, if you like this movie, you're STOOOPID. He's a funny guy, and he has come further than he ever has had before with NUTTY II. THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and BASEKETBALL made their bathroom humor clever, but NUTTY II doesn't."
2957,"What they did instead was dress up the standard love story with great actors, nice clothes, and pretty settings. especially Mr. Gere and Ms. Ryder, both talented performers. So after "" accidentally "" falling in love with Charlotte he can't bear the though of her dying and tries everything in his power to prevent her death (this might have something to do with his previous life where he was always the one with power, whilst the women weren't). Add to this the nonsensical secondary characters, the beautiful cinematography and two romantic leads that have all of the sexual chemistry of a drawer full of office supplies and you have the greatest gift to aficionados of bad movies everywhere."
2958,"Piper Perabo is an incredible find. Just like her character Violet, this film is her big break so her ability to understand the character and the role is implicit (another stroke of Bruckheimer genius). Perabo is an excellent actor with tremendous ability and potential. Australian actor Adam Garcia has great chemistry with Perabo as Violet's love interest. His pleasant demeanor and good looks have many people comparing him with Mel Gibson, although it remains to be seen whether he can handle roles that are more substantial."
2959,"A really good special effects movie as long as you don't expect anything more. But then again he's invisible right, he can do anything he wants. The script by Andrew W. Marlowe has a decent pace about but it does drag a little during the middle & has a good central premise, it takes he basic idea that being invisible will make you insane just like in the original The Invisible Man (1933) film which Hollow Man obviously owes a fair bit. It manages to have a petty successful blend of horror, sci - fi & action & provide good entertainment value for 110 odd minutes. It's nice to see technology has finally made it so that they can do just about anything you can think of in film."
2960,""") While Space Cowboys draws its humor from the characters' efforts to revert to their prior occupation and regain importance, the second part of the film--the mission--serves a dramatic purpose, where the characters' true mission is to disprove the others' belief that they are outdated and replaceable. Space Cowboys, which benefits from the performances of four seasoned actors, successfully establishes its four main characters as the source for all its comedy. This was a pretty enjoyable tale of "" The Ripe Stuff, "" four old geezers going up into space to help save a project they had a hand in years ago. Although the NASA - oriented material works well enough, the best moments arrive through the core cast's more mundane interactions, including the scenes where Corvin first tracks his friends down. Narratively, Space Cowboys' space sequence does little more than simply prolong the characters' task of proving themselves, yet visually, it offers eye - catching special effects and set design."
2961,"Although Keri Russell's Irish accent may not have achieved the subtle nuances of an Irish native, she did a fine job! Over all, this was a nice, fresh romantic comedy that was more entertaining than another film set in Ireland a fews years prior, The MatchMaker (with Janeane Garofalo). While the likes of Centre Stage has pretensions of grandeur, and Bootmen is a mild emotional letdown, Mad About Mambo offers an uncomplicated, fairly convincing love story, set against the beautiful backdrop of Ireland, and blended with some tasteful scenes of dance."
2962,"Excellent view of a mature woman, that is going to lose everything (even the pruner has a mortgage). Every character is extremely sympathetic, and, save for the first 20 or so minutes, the film is non-stop good cheer. A delightful gentle comedic gem, until the last five minutes, which degenerate into run of the mill British TV farce. It was beautifully acted in the more serious scenes and the funny moments were."
2980,"Her timing is impeccable, her imitations uproarious, and her candor admirable. This is not to say that this movie isn't funny, there are some bits that are absolutely hilarious. Her best material is the stuff regarding Asians, such as the prejudice and stereotyping (e. g. The best bits have to do with Cho's mother (her imitation is both hilarious and a bit touching), and Cho spends a lot of time on gay - related bits (many of which are genuinely funny). The comedy gets raunchy but is always funny; the entertainment value of this film--made on the most simple terms--far surpasses that of most movies made today."
2981,"this thing has it all: guy talk, girl talk, echoes and resonance, love and respect for all its characters, wit, poignancy, politics, uplift, a tremendous depth and breath of literary allusion, and a substantial dose of digestible philosophy from some of the greatest minds of world thought. thanks so much to Greer and Jenniphr Goodman for their script and direction. AND it's only 82 minutes long, you can almost fit it in on a lunch break but it will last you far longer than that. Whatever the moniker, everyone knows the type: a guy with stunning looks, a killer smile, lines that don't sound like come - ons, a silky smooth demeanor, an athletic build, whose only problem is deciding which women's numbers to cull from his rolodex. Dex is an enigma and the joke is that Dex realizes how unsavory he has become which also is the underlying angst he knows all to well: someone with so much potential only wasted by his own hand."
2982,"The story is classic good vrs. Yes, the leads act really well, but the plot made them look like chickens running around with their heads off. Bless the Child is a great film for what it is and maybe be known as the starting point to the great career of Holliston Coleman. What seems to have peeved many of the reviewers is that "" good, "" in the form of a little girl (Holliston Coleman), was actually presented as having some real (and quiet) strength for a change. Wow, this is a rarity: a modern - day film in which the Christians (mostly nuns in this story) are the "" good guys "" and the New Age advocates are the devil - like "" bad guys . """
2983,"If Cecil B. Demented is to be taken as a genuine satire, it is clearly meant as a satire of both sides of the argument. The critic who points out that the Sprockets' tattoos "" read like a list of directors kids SHOULD be watching "" and who compares the love of Preminger with the dislike of Lean clearly doesn't realize that Waters is in on the contradiction. The Sprockets celebrate "" art movies "" as they celebrate pornography and Kung Fu flicks. DeMented's crew worships directors like Sam Peckinpah, Kenneth Anger, Pedro AlmodÃ³var, Samuel Fuller, David Lynch and Rainer Werner Fassbinder, and not everybody will realize the irony in the end, but for film buffs who like these tidbits, "" Cecil B. DeMented "" is an absolute riot. A good film for film buffs, this is one of those movies that wants to destroy the very foundation it was built upon in the most crude and visceral way possible."
2984,""" The Eyes Of Tammy Faye "", a documentary about the little lady with the big eyelashes, the running mascara, and the child like voice, likewise presents a woman who was sincere, surprisingly intelligent, energetic, persevering, and of course. This and several other scenes are hard to watch (though it's fun to see the reporter stammer when Tammy asks him point blank why he printed lies about her). Whether you love her, hate her, or are totally uninterested in her, "" The Eyes of Tammy Faye "" will bring you closer to Tammy Faye, and provide golden nuggets of insight in to who she really is as a person. Whatever faults and foibles she may have had, she was an inspiration to millions of down - home folks, a person who seemed genuinely loving, someone who wanted to reach out and hug everyone she met. "" The Eyes of Tammy Faye "" tells a solid story about a family's reversal of fortune, and one woman's really hard struggle through a life which is far from being complete."
2985,"In the safe, his halpess "" helper "", posing as a cousin from Ireland, gets Walken trapped and caught by the cops. The most interesting scene was where he was practicing "" cracking "" the 3 different safe combinations within 6 minutes to avoid setting off the alarm. The scenes and dialogue are carefully crafted and the film as a whole is very well cast and acted."
2986,"Gene Hackman and the rest of this ensemble cast did a great job--everyone has his or her moments. The players were told to play and hit the way they normally would. Jon Favreau gets a special mention as the crazy S. W. A. T. officer turned linebacker who took the wild man role to the next level. Also, like the hockey scenes in "" Slapshot, "" the actual football sequences are really bone crunching. Director Howard Deutch (Pretty in Pink, Grumpier Old Men) did a great job on the football sequences."
2987,"Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn and Vincend D'Onofrio. And so begins a strange array of visuals and sounds, blended together so unusually that you honestly feel like you're experiencing a dream His Carl Stargher would make even Hannibal Lecter scream for mommy. The things that she later sees in the mind of Vincent Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) are amazingly imaginative and fascinating, most of this stuff has never been seen in film before. The cinematography by Paul Laufer where opaque primary colours are to the fore is stunning but Singh doesn't let it end there, things like costume design where Stargher wanders around his idiosyncratic universe wearing opulent costumes does have a visual impact making this so much more than a run of a mill thriller What stops THE CELL becoming a classic movie however is that you start becoming more and more aware that the whole movie revolves around the visuals rather than having a natural narrative."
2989,"Hughley was funny as well, especially when he was interacting with the audience. The film is at its best when Lee's cameraman, Malik Sayeed, just plops his camera down and lets the comics do their stuff. Well, it's not technically a soundtrack, but the songs played in the stadium at the show were a great mix of old - school love songs and funk. Steve Harvey did great jokes, and even did things, that while not really funny, were great entertainment, like when he was playing samples of different songs for the audience. What these men were doing with comparing black and white is NO DIFFERENT than when Jeff Foxworthy compares and contrasts rednecks and sophisticated people."
2998,"Snipes puts in a fine performance as Neil Shaw, a united nations defence agent who is wanted for the assassination of the Chinese U. N. ambassador at a time where U. S. and Chinese relations are already strained. The Art of War delivers action, thrills and good plot twists and overall is a satisfying thriller. It looks like real internet, as opposed to glossy, DVD quality streaming video. Anne Archer does a fine job as the manipulative career diplomat, pulling everyone's strings behind the scenes. But this movie has two things that those movies lacked, STYLE and an enjoyable supporting cast."
2999,"Ramblin' Jack's story is in many ways the story of American music in the 20th Century, and this documentary tells that story with vitality from the unique perspective of a daughter trying to come to terms with her father's family - excluding career. The historic documents - a shot of young Zimmerman in the crowd at a Ramblin' Jack show, rare film of roots artists, home movies - are just amazing, and the interviews with the Guthrie clan and other survivors of the 50s folkie era are illuminating. Folk was a musical movement born in backwaters and the public squares of melting pot cities, of the fusion of cultures - black and rural, diverse and rich as the world - into the raw stuff of entertainment. Jack's identification and fascination with cowboy music establishes a link to American myth and the dreams of a decade that yearned for the freedom of boundless frontiers while established powers did their best to suppress cultural deviance. "" Ballad Of Ramblin' Jack Elliott "" (2000) documentary: Wonderful portrait of a' 60's era rebel and artist of high gifts who never quit the 60's."
3000,"The film's brisk pacing was perfectly suited to its theme, thanks to director Peyton Reed, the writing smart, sharp, and consistently and authentically funny, (as well as, at times, genuinely thought - provoking) thanks to writer Jessica Bendinger, and the acting solid all around. This delightful comedy uses its ostensible theme of cheerleading rivalry to comment on its own genre, the teen movie. Bring it on' falls into neither of these traps, but is aware that its genre is exhausting itself, and raises a number of pertinent issues. The plot is the old stand - by: a team of underdogs against the odds, triumph against circumstances and expectations. This creates a genuine tension, added to little asides (such as Torrence's brother's T - shirt,' Cheerleading = Death') that make a familiar narrative interesting, problematic and unpredictable."
3002,"Both Jon and Famke are ultra believable and endearing characters. Ok so a lil extravagant, what are the odds that she dates the actor of her ex boyfriends fave movie, she refused to see? Famke Jansen is a standout as Kate, the film's protagonist. A more experienced director could have played up the many one liners and the countless funny moments from Kate's love life. Famke Janssen and Jon Favreau make a brilliant team and the onscreen chemistry between them makes the film seem ever more realistic."
3003,"' Steal This Movie' made some bold casting choices. However, Vincent fills the role wonderful, brilliantly, expressing all the conflicting sides of Hoffman's personality, his sense of humor, his dead seriousness, strict political consciousness, bi-polar disorder, having to live in hiding and away from his wife and son. Abbie's wife Anita is played wonderfully by SNL's Janeane Garofalo, accomplished comedian but not so as a dramatic actress. But it didn't really capture the mood of the 60s--there really was a community of people all across the country who felt a shared vibe, but this movie portrayed the movement that Abbie was involved in as merely a political movement, with political countermovements against it. Vincent D'Onofrio plays the lead with a real passion, and Janeane Garofalo also displays competent dramatic ability as Abbie's wife Anita."
3004,"Bruce Payne, playing the embittered Jacob Kell, provides a fine interpretation that is however in the line of the other "" Highlander "" villains. People who like Jet Li, will surely like this man (probably because he has been Li's choreographer in a lot of movies). In any case, "" Highlander Endgame "" is a great film, with more action and entertainment than the other sequels, and it's a great choice even for non fans. All in all, Davis / Panzer have once again given credit to this wonderful science fiction series by watching the details of the character's pasts and still creating unknown events in their lives. Tired of the endless fights, Connor MacLeod enters the Sanctuary, a place where immortals can rest forever under the guard of the Watchers."
3005,Pras and his lady - friend are about the ONLY people among the masses that look as though they know what they're doing. A couple of good points on the black music industry (literaly and figuratively) and a couple of stand out performances are cluttered by a lame excuse for a music video plot. It was straight to DVD at best.
3006,"At least they aren't the increasingly boring high school type characters), and yes, some are lusty (basically the character played by Anna Loos is, and it is handled quite tastefully in the German language version), but Anatomy is well constructed, there is a tense mood throughout, the sets are amazing, the makeup effects are a wow, and Franka Potente is very credible in her role. The story of a student discovering a sort - of secret society doing autopsies on still - living patients is a rather creepy scenario and what happens to those patients afterwards is quite clever. It is a bit mature in mind, as it doesn't resort to constant opportunities for sexual encounters (a breast fest) or juvenile drug jokes. THE IMPORTANT STUFF: Watching this film in the original German language with English or French subtitles is the BEST way to enjoy it. The fact that it does this is actually a fun idea, as there's plenty to be crept out at by the rather large amount of time spent among cadavers, which is enough on it's own but here, using the practice is where it really scores a lot of great scenes where she's investigating them."
3007,"Nurse Betty (2000) This is a sleeper, a dark comedy with enough inventive twists to call to mind The Truman Show but with a greater sense of reality to hold it down. The utterly disgusting violence of one 20 second scene might turn off some viewers near the beginning, but if you can keep watching, the movie gets better from there. This is an adorable, if somewhat edgy, comedy from a clever and witty script by John C. Richards, crisply directed by the very talented Neil LaBute, proving that he can handle comedy just as adroitly as he can the art house movie. But such contrivances should be written off as poetic license and ignored. More significantly, what makes this work is the cleverness of the plot melded well with the personalities of the characters (while gently satirizing them), and some very funny dialogue."
3008,"The director managed to get his timing right to get Reeves in the midst of a reasonable cast; he shot a few videos for Reeves' band years prior in exchange for Reeves doing this film which, despite hitting it big with The Matrix, was a promise he honoured. No, he's not doing anything different with it from anyone else who plays this type of serial killer role but he is still charismatic enough to make a difference. Instead of crisp dialogue, there are pointless shifts from positive images to negative colour. But then impressive high technology is not unique to movies. James Spader in an outstanding performance as a cop tormented by many demons, both in his mind and on the other end of his telephone."
3009,"Benicio Del Toro has this presence about him that radiates "" coolness "", and Ryan Phillippe did a remarkable job as well with his role. The double meaning of the game of hearts explanation was fascinating and fun to decipher. Benicio Del Toro was probably the best as his expressions and just the way he says things is unbeatable. Their facial expressions and personal ticks speak louder than words ever could. The plot was hard to understand in some parts yet it was still good and sometimes the motives were beyond the viewer's grasp but it still flowed well regardless."
3010,"Almost Famous is a stunning, thought - provoking film that comes at you directly from the eye of the camera and hits you with a hard bang. Almost Famous is realistic, funny, touching, and one of those rare movies that makes you feel like you've gained something just for having seen it. The film is classically cool and endlessly enjoyable, making it by far one of the top 5 movies of last year. Hudson gives a masterful performance as Penny Lane, she pulls off all Lane's facial expressions effortlessly brilliantly, and God knows she is one of the most stunning young performers of her current time, and she gives one of the most memorably exciting performances of 2000. One of the most critically acclaimed movie experiences of the year 2000, Almost Famous is the second feature film to come out Cameron Crowe, and he beats his first effort, Jerry Maguire by a mile."
3011,"While Vincent (Vincent Kartheiser) the seemingly gloomy one, who loves her from the beginning of the film is the sole voice of reason, hope, and beauty in her slowly cascading world of tragedies. Roseanne (Monica Keena) is a popular and beautiful student that is admired by a lot of people, especially by a lonely outcast Vincent (Vincent Kartheiser) who is obsessed with her and follows her around everywhere, hoping to get noticed. The 3 best aspects to this film are the acting, cinematography and soundtrack. Both delivered dynamic and intriguing performances. Monica Keena's character is transformed throughout the film and she's able to convey that arc with great subtlety."
3012,"It was a nice little story, made into a very fine, charming, stick - to - your memory movie with talent oozing out the corners. Gwyneth Paltrow provides a few highlights here, as well; besides creating a very real, believable character in Liv, it's worth watching the film just to see her sing ` Bette Davis Eyes. And even if the plot structure isn't like Altman, the plots of the multiple characters come out like a movie made for t. v. What's pretty amazing is that all of the actors are pretty darn good singers (except for Andre Braugher, which is reported to have a voice over for his singing). Sure, there are other good aspects of this movie, such as surprisingly good acting from Huey Lewis and a very low key, quirky representation of his daughter, played by Gwenneth Paltrow. Director Bruce Paltrow assembled an impressive ensemble cast to deliver this story about a diverse group of people with many things in common--more than they would probably ever realize or admit to, in fact."
3014,"Although some of these films have been good ("" Edge of Seventeen "" for example), it is very nice to see a movie where the main character's sexuality is not the focal point of the film. And there are many great scenes that lead up to this finale that are alternately hilarious and emotionally moving. But if you are someone who has the ability to think deeply and see further than the end of your nose, and enjoy reflecting on a film after you see it, you will not be disappointed. The depth, power and heat of Urbania are its real stunning feats. But towards the climax, the film reveals its true colors."
3015,"What you can expect is a quirky, well - crafted movie about the ordinary lives of superheros. The conceit of this film is pure genius: make a superhero movie in which there are no battles, and nobody uses their powers; just focus on their personal lives and interpersonal conflicts, and play it mostly for laughs. It's a funny superhero movie with a dance number and no displays of superpowers. As a bunch of misfits with only their very mild "" super "" powers and illusions (?) Their lives are a mix of joy and sorrow, victory and defeat, humor and despair."
3016,"However, less than an hour before the event, Henry is called into the police station by friend Capt Victor Benezet to clarify some points on his statement. Stephen Hopkins' direction is hip, inventive and unstagy (though it must be said that his "" a person can physically visit someone else's flashbacks "" trick had already been done three years earlier, in "" The Ugly ""), the dialogue is sharp, and the story is compelling. A film with Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman in the two main roles is a dream come true for anyone who loves the art of acting, and their performances here (especially Hackman's, who after all does have the more showy part) are stunning. THE CASTS The characters in GARDE Ã  VUE are better delineated and more incisive than in UNDER SUSPICION, and give more opportunities to the actors: if Hackman is excellent, his character is less complex than Serrault's, who fits his to perfection; Freeman's performance is not one of his bests, while Ventura is outstanding as an inspector who fails to remain objective, and whose future accordingly is bleak; Romi Schneider's delicate features and calculating coldness are perhaps more suited to the story than Monica Bellucci's earthly beauty; Thomas Jane has not much to do, while Guy Marchand's sadistic impersonation earned him a Cesar, the French equivalent of Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. END OF SPOILERS THE TECHNICAL TEAMS Many of the best directors love to lend a hand in the writing of their movies; such is the case for Claude Miller, co-writing a closely - knit script with Jean Herman prior to directing it, incisively and faultlessly; witty vitriolic dialogue by Michel Audiard and a perfectly suited musical score by FranÃ§ois de Roubaix are priceless contributions."
3018,"Though eminently forgettable once you are out of the cinema hall, while inside, it is worth every minute of yours. Recommended to take along someone you love. The best thing about the movie it its old world charms, which is so endearing. They can create films of integrity, subtlety, and convey emotions and intellectual content that is never present in more mainstream films. Benicio, also, initiates flutters in the hearts of any female viewers with his charming persona."
3019,"Selma represents one of God's little quirks of nature. An impoverished Czech - born emigrÃ© living in a small Northwestern U. S. industrial town during the mid-60s, this luckless creature manages to eek out a meager Airstream - like existence as a factory worker, despite the fact she is legally blind. With her eyesight failing, her ears become the only sense of joy, falling periodically into bouts of fantasy anytime she grabs onto a rhythm or beat (like machine sounds, train engines, etc.), wherein she becomes the star of her own working - class musical production. These compelling sequences become mere extensions of her real - life circumstances, i. e., the musical interludes at work will include the factory itself as a set piece and the other workers as her ensemble. BjÃ¶rk's odd musical talent and vocal style may be an acquired taste, but she is so mesmerizing here it becomes a non-issue."
3020,"When the advertising for Best in Show had the tagline "" From the Team That Brought You Waiting for Guffman "", a fair number of critics out there implied in their reviews that only people that are familiar with the film or its filmmakers and cast would have a good time seeing this film. The film begins with a mockumentary style, introducing the main competitors (not to mention screwballs) of the annual Mayflower "" Best In Show "" competition, where dogs of all breeds come to compete to see who is the top dog. Christopher Guest's Best of Show follows his great tradition of fake - documentaries which includes This is Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman. Other contenders include Michael McKean, Michael Hitchcock, Catherine O'Hara, Jennifer Coolidge, John Michael Higgins, Parker Posey and in a exceptional effort as a man with 2 left feet, Eugene Levy (he also co-wrote the script with Guest). Co-writer Eugene Levy (American Pie) is perfect as the husband finding out that his wife Catherine O'Hara might be Miss Congeniality of all time."
3022,"Greg Berlanti's film is worthy of a lot of praise in a society where gay men tend to only fulfill certain stereotypes. The script is brilliantly written and sparkles when it is at its peak. Timothy Olyphant stands out here in an able cast, made up primarily of TV actors. 39: 1 Sound formats: Dolby Digital / SDDS The lives and loves of an LA softball team, comprised entirely of gay men. Greg Berlanti's heartfelt drama seems a little timid in the wake of confrontational entries like "" Queer as Folk "", but the former producer and co-writer of TV's gay - friendly "" Dawson's Creek "" makes an otherwise auspicious directorial debut with this familiar account of several gay friends looking for love and companionship in vanity - driven Los Angeles."
3023,"An excellent movie with brilliant performances from all especially Michelle. First time writer / director Karyn Kusama has done a terrific job of creating a realistic setting for her story, presenting an honest portrait of life in the projects and conveying that desperation so familiar to so many young people who find themselves in dead - end situations and on that road that leads to nowhere. Chosen from among several hundred actors at a cattle call, Rodriguez, who had only previously worked as an extra, captures Diana's hostile intensity and indifference perfectly and has a screen presence that most actors would sell a couple of souls for. Technically and artistically a good shoot with an sense of honesty and reality about it, "" Girlfight "" is no chick flick and no "" Rocky "". Quickly improving in the ring despite the hoots of derision aimed at her from her fellow boxers, Diana finds problems with a lack of female opposition, love in the shape of another up and coming amateur and a conflict on the horizon with her father bound to find out sooner or later."
3024,"Together they try to get their players of both races to get along and put on a winning team. But when Coach Boone and Coach Yoast prove that the Titans are a winning team, the issue of race is erased and the true meaning of teamwork is born. The cast list is impressive, Denzel Washington and Will Patton find instant chemistry as the head coaches thrust together by outside influences, with both guys beautifully doing credit to the real life friendship that would be born from the situation. Herman Boone has to bring blacks and whites together for a highschool football team to play with each other. Oscar winner Denzel Washington gives another one of his fine performances as the new head coach of the high school football team, and Will Patton is equally good as the current head coach who is now demoted to assistant coach under Washington."
3080,"First, it is very well made, and artistically shot with some highly memorable scenes, such as the one where Will Smith first appears out of the dark. Another surprising thing about this film is that the kid, J. Michael Moncrief, is fantastic in his part as young Hardy Greaves (kid actors, with the exceptions of Rupert Grint and Haley Joel Osment, tend to have very poor acting skills. Redford is known for this trait, and indeed has directed some of the most beautiful movies ever made (A River Runs Through It, The Milagro Beanfield War, The Horse Whisperer). The thing you have to bear in mind when watching The Legend of Bagger Vance is that sports movies, by their very definition, tend to match the atmosphere of the sport they depict. Basketball movies meanwhile often rely on the street / hip hop connection and are just as loud, but with a slightly more gritty edge to them, provided you completely forget about the atrocious Space Jam."
3049,""" Addressing the status of today's black performers in a number of interviews, Lee has accused gangsta rap of being ` the 21st century minstrel show'. The same is true of TV, where ` about 95% of blacks on television now are working on sit - coms. The gold chains, oversized sport jerseys, and baseball caps worn sideways are clownish and not far removed from the olden days when blacks played buffoons to entertain white people. On the subject of blacks in film, Lee has condemned the use of ` Super Magical Niggers' in the likes of The Green Mile and The Legend of Bagger Vance, men who ` use magic to help white people but can't help themselves . ' But while it fails on many levels, the good ideas remain and allow Lee to explore two main themes â€“ the past degradation of black performers and the position they hold today."
3050,"The animation is great and fun to look at, there's a lot of comedy, interesting characters and rad monsters. Maybe the reason it beats Pokemon (apart from the reasons above) is because Digimon shows a lot more human emotion, rather than just fight fight fight pull Brock away from girls and more fighting and getting shiny badges. The second part is the longest and most enjoyable: it features Tai and Izzy trying to stop a Digimon with a virus that has taken over the internet. There are funny moments, and the fight scenes are cool without being too violent. Except for the previews for several horrible kid movies and an excruciating ten minute Angela Anaconda short, Digimon: The Movie was a great film!"
3051,"The original film is one of the best English thrillers of all time and despite being made nearly thirty years ago still packs a punch. This film features interesting cinematography, with strange forward jump cuts (ripped off from The Limey), odd angles and the use of colour filters. It has great acting, sharp directing, nice car chase scenes, nice action scenes, some great moments, some wonderful music, a simple yet effective storyline that keeps you guessing and wanting to see more. Action - thrillers don't require good acting, but they sure are enhanced by it. The remainder of the supporting cast, including Mickey Rourke, Rachel Leigh Cook, John C. McGinley, Alan Cumming and Michael Caine, each deliver convincing performances, conveying their characters' emotions with amazing quality."
3053,"De Niro and Stiller play off each other brilliantly, and both of them give fine comic performances, with a surprising level of depth for comedy characters. This film is packed with slick gags, hilarious scenes and it has a really fun story; it's a comedy film that you don't want to miss. Most of the funny moments in' Meet the Parents' involve painful scenes with Ben Stiller. Stiller and Wilson have made a lot of films together and for some reason their scenes always work, they at least make you smile. The pressures of making a great first impression can make any man or woman, feel awkward and nervous."
3054,"The climactic sequence, where the protagonists are effectively destroyed by their addictions, seemed to trigger a bout of heavy breathing in the audience. The film leads the audience down a spiral of addiction until the grand finale, which features a montage of graphically intense scenes and images with more edits per second than any film. Director Darren Aronofsky shines in his brilliant direction and style, in this depiction of the downward spiral of the lives of four people, living with their respective addictions. Sarah soon starts having very scary strung - out hallucinations - starting out with subtle things like time woozily slowing down and speeding back up, and when her refrigerator suddenly starts moving on its own, the real nightmare begins. By using a combination of slow and fast motion shots, extreme close - ups and more edits than you can shake a stick at, Aronofsky successfully brings the audience into the world and mind of someone with a drug problem."
3055,"Not real historically accurate on many fronts. TIGERLAND / (2000) *** 1/2 (out of four) By Blake French: Throughout the years audiences have seen and understood war films with every point of view possible, and somehow producers and writers always come up with new and innovative methods of portraying various soldiers on the battlefield. It follows a bunch of recruits through basic training and then Tigerland--an accurate portrayal of Vietnam on American soil, before they're shipped over."
3056,"The film works because the charismatic work of Michael Rispoli, who as Buddy, is a man with a heart of gold. Rispoli gives a heart - felt performance that echoes Jackie Gleason as a beaten upon husband who just wants something better and the rest of the ensemble adds some color to what could have been a retread of' Moonstruck', its distant third cousin in theory. Terrific performances (especially from the lead - Michael Rispoli - who can be over the top at times in other films or just give wonderfully layered performances - like on the Sopranos or his work as a priest in The Third Miracle). Full of real characters with real emotions and real conflicts, the movie moves along at a nice pace with some real twists and surprises along the way. Rookie filmmaker Raymond De Felitta based this semi-autobiographical nostalgic romantic drama set in Staten Island circa 1956 on his beloved and well - intentioned late uncle with Rispoli as a working stiff who dreams of opening his own bar to sing in with no help from his totally unsupportive wife Narducci sending him into the unlikely arms of the unwed Irish mother of a biracial baby (the very pretty Macdonald) who is a tenant in their recently bought household."
3057,"Interlaced with much thought - provoking material and Academy Award worthy performances, "" The Contender "" is one of the best pictures of the year. The information is leaked to the press, while Runyon uses the discussion to bring the subject in the hearings. The movie succeeds with its accurate and involving performances. Gary Oldman is perfect with a sly, cunningly cocky and self - confident performance that fits his character extremely well; there is a very real possbility his work will be remembered come Academy Award time. This is a very thought - provoking story, full of surprising twists and a meaningful message."
3058,"His heroic efforts as an OB / GYN have led his patients to make unreasonable demands on him that make his job a hell. Just as all of this comes apart, he runs into a woman from outside Dr. T's kingdom. It was a very critical condition that academy award voters overlooked her brilliant acting. Altman again is able to get some well - known actors to appear in his movies - Farrah Fawcett, Helen Hunt, Tara Reid, Liv Tyler, Kate Hudson, and Shelley Long are the other female players involved in this one. If you dig seeing that dramatized, Dr. T is fairly unique."
3059,"It has everything to a great movie, acting, cinematography, editing, and of course, writing. The Ladies Man is a funny movie. The movie gets funnier and stranger in the second hour, when anything resembling a plot was apparently tossed out the window. "" The Ladies Man "" character already has enough energy to be in a eighty minute film, but does he have the humor, plot, and charisma capabilities of carrying such precious minutes? Yes it may be goofy and may not seem as funny as many high budget comedies out there, but this movie is truly hilarious if you really watch it."
3060,"Father Lareaux (John Hurt), Deacon John Townsend (Elias Koteas), Father Frank Page (Brian Reddy) and the teacher Maya Larkin (Winona Ryder), who was possessed and exorcised in the past, unsuccessfully try to exorcise the man and Father Lareaux is deeply affected and falls into a coma. Maya brings the Viznik's coded writings and after deciphering it, she concludes that the writer Peter Kelson (Ben Chaplin) might be the Antichrist to be incarnated by Satan. The stylish "" Lost Souls "" is one of the most underrated horror films ever. The cinematography is top - notch; the excellent camera work explores unusual angle; the cast is magnificent; and the film has not aged after sixteen years. The story and direction (by first time director and award winning cinematographer Janusz Kaminski) rachet up the thrills and suspense and arent afraid to offer a downbeat ending."
3070,"Billy Elliott is a moving, uplifting, and often exuberant, drama about motherless young Billie (Jamie Bell) fulfilling his dream of becoming a ballet dancer, in the process overcoming the objections and prejudices of his father and brother (Gary Lewis and Jamie Draven). It is also a piece of magic realism, with political overtones. By setting their near fairy tale in the context of a close - knit mining community, and more specifically against the backdrop of the 1984/5 miners' strike - a defining moment of modern British economic and social history - writer Lee Hall and director Stephen Daldry are able to refer to gender and class issues, without turning their work into a political tract, and without losing focus on the central human drama. Lewis and Draven put gritty realism and passion into their roles of a father and son committed to their community and to the miners' cause. The scenes of violence between strikers and police are presented uncompromisingly and authentically, but with the occasional touch of humour."
3071,"A cute flick sans slapstick, pratfalls, and jokes, "" Bedazzled "" offers lots of outrageous situations, some sentimental moments, and a whiff of philosophy. Bedazzled exudes a positive, good - natured warmth, and is proof that comedy doesn't have to depend on silly sophomoric antics, pratfalls, or foul language. The 1967 original, starring Dudley Moor and Peter Cook and directed by Stanley Donen was a droll dark comedy that bombed when it was first released to theatres but has developed a very strong cult following over the years. in this case a sly, brilliantly cunning, sexy devil who playfully torments Brendan by dooming each of his wishes with unintended, nasty surprises. Someone in Movie Heaven dropped a feather down on Ramis, the director of such good time romps as Ghostbusters and Stripes."
3072,"There are some really wonderful ideas here and in all honestly there are really two or three movies within "" Pay It Forward "". All the performers are right on. Osment is the greatest child actor to ever live, hands down. Spacey is always a guaranteed performance and Hunt has grown as an actress in just the last several years. Trevor is played with an endearing maturity and at times, unstable frustration by uber kid actor Osment."
3076,"These are the kinds of questions the script toys with, and the result is wildly engaging. Book of Shadows is a great horror film, not quite as ambitious as the director set out to convey in his final cut, but tons of fun for horror fans. The performances are top - notch, and the film is peppered with disturbing scenes and images, and some ghoulish scenarios. There are also some great scenes that show a level of cinematography that is not evident in the grainy original. It mentions the original film as a work of fiction, and it is debatable if the BWP2 storyline exists in the same continuum as the first film."
3077,""" Lucky Numbers "" doesn't, for a second, make you feel warm and tingly. They want to see goofy, Jim - Carrey - type comedies that make you laugh out loud, while making you feel all warm and tingly inside. This is a funny movie, though not uproariously so; things happen that you will laugh at in spite of yourself, while at other times there are moments that are genuinely side - splitting hilarious (one in particular, near the end, that involves an eighteen - wheeler). Both these films are good but flawed dark comedies and deserve to be seen and enjoyed. But, he starts to get in debt, and his snowmotor business is loosing because of a warm winter."
3078,"The cult of celebrity and beauty is exposed in the blackest humor by Denys Arcand with the hysterical Stardom. Director Denys Arcand, who previously made the French classic The Decline of the American Empire as well as the religious mockery of Jesus of Montreal, gives an effective documentary feel. The modeling world which Tina inhabits is exposed with stunning cinematography as Arcand strips away the layers of commercialism that relies on selling the notions of youth and physical perfection like Tina Menzel. teaching a 400 - level Yale course in "" Sports and Celebrity Entertainment "" and warning students of Millie - Vanilli versus Celine Dion talent spotting. But as movies such as "" Waiting for Guffman "" and "" Best in Show "" will attest to; you need to care about the characters on screen, even if things they do are ridiculous."
3079,"Some of the satire is actually rather smart, and the girls are game for just about anything. You can nitpick all the dumbness and stupidity of the script, but here's someone (among a surprisingly high number of others) who are happy to defend its silliness. This movie is simply too over the top, and the' funny' moments are quite laboured. Here, it's three gorgeous babes kicking the tar out of everyone. The colors in this movie are vivid and fun to view."
3081,"Also a great production along with a great Heavy Metal soundtrack make this film one of the best movies Adam's ever done. Luckily that does not apply to this film, every aspect of this film is great, from the surprise cameo by "" CHUBS "" (Carl Weathers) to Harvey Keitel's hilarious turn as Papa Satan. There is nothing to not like about this movie, it is virtually non-stop laughs from beginning to end. This was a great film and one of the best films of the year, contrary to what so many others say. The support cast is made up of plenty of well - known faces but few are used well at all and too many of them are embarrassing."
3082,"After a stint trying his hand as a comedian (` Analyze This', ` The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle', ` Meet The Parents'), Robert DeNiro is back to his dramatic roots with an outstanding performance. Brashear is much more complex and grounded, and the issues he faces are life crises, making the part far more challenging. This well - acted story of the end of segregation in the military is told through the true experiences of Carl Brashear. DeNiro is always convincing and believable here, very good performance, Gooding Jr. is not bad, definitely one of his better performances. The performances are quite good - particularly Goodings'."
3083,"The sub plot involving the crews relationship between pentigill who was a last minute choice for the mission is excellent. "" Red Planet "" is a film that has solid special effects, but also a strong story and good characterizations. It allows suspense to be created from the series of crises that spring up on the astronauts and that's a benefit."
3084,"Laura Linney's performance as the somewhat - restrained Sammy is easily her best, and Mark Ruffalo's as Terry is also highly evolved. The beauty of this film is that there are literally hundreds of places for the plot or action to derail and become an emotional sap-fest ripe with over-dramatic exclamations, but it stays right on track, always honest, brutal, and, ultimately, endearing. In one of the many manifestations of the power of the indie flicks during the past ten years, rebellious young Terry Prescott (Mark Ruffalo) comes to visit his sister Samantha (Laura Linney) and her son Rudy (Rory Culkin), upsetting their normal lives. The acting was top - notch, the principles were great and everyone else was cast so perfectly that every second of the film just falls into place. Mark Ruffalo gives a fantastic performance as an Unfamous, Untalented Bob Dylan."
3087,"It builds gradually with an interesting premise leading an impressive and breathtaking highlights, thanks to involving plot is interesting enough to keep the movie going on. His is a performance with a surprising level of humanity, especially in scenes where he's going about his daily life. It is filled with action, twists, turns, edge of your seat suspense and drama that will appeal to all movie fans of every age. 1sound and sharp visuals, this was another entertaining Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle. A good movie for DVD with terrific 5."
3088,"` Bounce' is an utterly winning romantic drama, replete with an intriguing storyline, believable characters and honest emotions. Excellent romantic drama tinged with equal parts tragedy and comedy with Affleck (in one of his best roles to date) as a charming alcoholic ad exec who sobers up after a year of harboring a guilt - plagued secret: - giving his plane ticket to family man Goldwyn en route home only to die in a plane crash killing all aboard â€“ and seeking out the widow to make amends. Laugh and cry formula works and the on - again - off - again real - life relationship between the couple underscores all the emotions on full tilt. A writer, in Chicago for the opening (and sadly, the closing) of one of his plays, Janello has a wife, Abby (Gwyneth Paltrow), and two kids waiting for him at home, and is grateful for Buddy's apparent random act of kindness. And Paltrow is absolutely disarming as Abby; gentle and vulnerable to a fault, winsomely charming, and beautifully played."
3089,"Howard's' How the Grinch Stole Christmas' is a delightful family flick that both adults and children can enjoy (mostly with each other). The little girl in here, "" Cindy Lou Who "" (Taylor Momsen) is really cute and the costumes and hairdos of the little people in here are fun to view. Momsen is OK but really just a ` cute kid' and, while the support cast has quite a few famous faces, they don't make much of an impact under the makeup and the film is left to Carrey to save it - which he happily does. However, it's Christmas and it has a nice message while not totally giving in to syrupy sentiment (thanks again to manic Carrey) and it's just perfect for kids and adults at Christmas time. Carrey is a master at his trade and no one could have played this role to perfection as he did."
3091,"In spite of its problems,' Rugrats in Paris' is fun to watch and brings back fond enough memories of watching the television series as a child and teenager. There are ample parodies of other movies (to make the adults laugh - outright), as well as lots of fun for the little ones. While well written and funny, plus the Reptar was cool, this film is not a masterpiece, it is too short, and some of the secondary characters needed more development. The animation is more fluid and detailed than that in the television series while the backgrounds for Euroreptarland are vibrant and imaginative. In addition to the usual voices used in the Nickelodeon series the addition of Debbie Reynolds, Susan Sarandon, John Lithgow and Casey Kasem make this film version just that much better."
3092,"There were scenes in which it looked like the puppies were in real danger but the magic lies in the fact that, when you read the credits, you realize those scenes were created; no puppy was ever in danger. The best part was the credits at the beginning - they were cute and well done. This film is better than 101 Dalmatians, which in its own right was very good, and both children and adults will enjoy it. The puppies are cute, as always, and some of the laughs are well enjoyable for the kiddies. Enormous fun for both adults and children, this film works on numerous levels: there is everything from car crashes and cake in the face to some very good (yet subtle) jokes for adults."
3093,"Malena is one of those movies that gets stuck in your mind. Malena is a beautiful and deeply touching film. The two leading actors (Monica Bellucci and Giuseppe Sulfaro) are simply excellent at what they are supposed to convey in this movie. "" Malena "" is a film that is blessed by the presence of that amazingly beautiful actress Monica Belucci. A lot of people in this forum have expressed their views in making "" Malena "" a coming of age film."
3094,"Every new role Kate Winslet performs is different from the previous and she excels every time. The restrained emotions and frustration of unfulfilled desires of his character were just performed brilliantly. A baroque and quite entertaining film about the Marquis de Sade (Geoffrey Rush) and the conflicting reactions (disgust, titillation, excitement, abhorrence) his ideas and writings fostered in those exposed to them. Also doing a fine job in this film is the ever - reliable Kate Winslet, and providing the ick factor he brings to every movie he's in is Joaquin Phoenix as a religious man who's disturbed by the naughty thoughts de Sade makes him realize he has. The costumes and production design are a delight and earned Oscar nominations, as did Rush for his performance."
3095,"Like the squares of a comic strip. These are two of the most powerful pieces of any film score around. Yeah, he's no Hermann or Morricone, but the emotional weight and emotive power of his chords and his overall composition are just downright chilling. Other themes of the movie, like how completely different people can always be connected in some way and how everyone has their vulnerabilities and weaknesses are intriguing, yet universal. Certain scenes in the movie are really quite striking and powerful."
3096,"The casting of CTHD is perfect. Here in CTHD, she proves herself as an excellent dramatic actress. The secrete longing for Li and the confusion of Li's true feelings were clearly conveyed by her eyes. What a wonderful talent to steal scenes after scenes from the veterans around her. Peter Pau not only captured the landscapes and the settings, he also managed to capture the fast - as - lightening action wonderfully."
3097,"Better attempts at fantasy film making have been shot on camcorders across the globe in people's back yards. Hundreds of thousands of loyal D&D fans have been waiting for over 25 years for a great, inspiring movie from their hobby. If you want to see a well acted & well made fantasy film watch Lord of the Rings instead. The CGI for the sets was a distant second to Wolfenstein 3D, and anything involving' magic' could've been better accomplished with a handful of colored yarn. The amount of other fantasy films it rips off is incredible, but The Lord of the Rings and Stars Wars seem particularly prevalent for the movie to plunder it's ideas from, and the resulting effect is merely a travesty of those classics."
3098,"Proof of Life might well satisfy those more knowledgeable in real - life military matters. Terry also says he is veteran of the elite British Special Air Service, and again, it is true that a huge proportion of ex-SAS members end up in private security efforts of various kinds. So many military raids in movies (The Dogs of War is a good example) just have the characters march out in the open and fire from the hip, with no seeming plan of movement other than to run around, destroy stuff, and look dramatic. When a film like Proof of Life is based on a true story, there are limits to this. So it's definitely worth seeing, but it's a little slow, and like real life the there is no consistent "" tone "" to the plot twists."
3099,"While mountaineering is one of the most exhilarating of sports it has produced little good fiction, and few good fictional movies, though there have been some excellent documentaries (' The Man who Skied Down Everest', the Imax' Everest' film, for example). Somehow, when it comes to fiction, the clichÃ©s take over, and this film, with some genuinely gorgeous camera - work and impressive stunts, is full of them. For this viewer, it brought back pleasant memories of climbing in the University holidays around the Southern Alps. There is a fair amount of special effects malarky (no - one, not even Temuera Morrison pretending to be Pakistani, would fly an old military helicopter so close to a mountain wall at 21, 000 feet), but there are also some genuinely stirring shots. and movies are meant to entertain."
3108,"Guy Richie's follow up to Lock Stock and Two Smoking barrels is every bit as astonishing as its predecessor. Brad Pitt sheds his movie start personna and preforms impressively as an Irish gypsie. the humour will appeal to all nationalities. Good preformances, fantastic characters, razor sharp diologue, expert direction and camera work and brilliant humour, Snatch will make you laugh more than any other movie this year. Brad Pitt as "" Mickey O'Neil "" is utterly 110% convincing."
3117,"The acting is very good, although, there's only 2 real sources of acting in this film, Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt. His life is forever changed after the plane crashes and he finds himself stranded all alone on an uncharted island. A fascinating, believable, and thought - provoking portrait of a man and his fight to live, with a remarkably ideal performance from Tom Hanks, and steady, effectively leisure direction that allows viewers to accompany this resilient survivor on his emotionally wrenching journey. If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. Cast Away is about love - about the difficulty of finding it in a world obsessed with success, about the freakish accidents that can produce or destroy it, about an ordeal that led one man to re-think what is meaningful in life, and about the need to bring to the pursuit of love the same resourcefulness and courage that enabled the hero to survive on an island for 5 years."
3110,"If you are generally a happy person and can laugh or cry at commercials, then you will enjoy the antics and slapstick of this movie. A fun, light hearted movie, with moments of comic genius. If you're a fan of "" Cheech and Chong "" - style stoner movies, and you're a gen - xer or younger, you probably enjoyed it. They know this movie will never appear in any Top 10 or 50 (except maybe Stupidest Movies Ever), and they're fine with that. MR PIZZACOLI: A trained dolphin could deliver pizza better than you too."
3111,"The Disney suits felt the same way, though were even less kind when it came to communicating that opinion to the creative team. improves upon each viewing, and the voice work is uniformly excellent, from David Spade's hilariously bratty emperor to Patrick Warburton's dim boy - toy Kronk to Eartha Kitt's Yzma (an over-the-top screeching Erte - style villainess with an alleged "" secret lab "" who is also "" scary beyond all reason ""). It's clever, unpretentious, fast - paced, and - like "" Lilo and Stitch "" - you don't feel that the vision of the film was muddled up by the suits. You've often heard the sales pitch, "" adults will love it, too! "" An adventure, a comedy and a drama all in one, "" The Emperor's New Groove "" has everything that was notably absent from DreamWorks' own South American - set cartoon "" The Road to El Dorado "" (charm, interest, no Elton John overdose and so on) and is the funniest movie from the House of Mouse since "" Aladdin . """
3112,"Harden, his co-nominee, is also excellent (although she's stuck uttering lines like, "" You've done it, Pollock. Harris's labor of love serves as an auspicious debut for someone who, at this stage, seems just as skilled behind the camera as he is in front of it. The story is a bit soap operish but if you enjoy art, and especially Pollock's work, you'll find this story fascinating. As Pollock, Ed Harris gives arguably the best performance of his career; he perfectly captures every emotional level of this complex individual, from the manic highs and lows (exacerbated by alcohol consumption) to the neutral moments in between. It's a terrific performance, through which Harden brings Lee to life, physically and emotionally."
3113,"A man suddenly finds himself able to read women's minds and actually know what women want from men. This film starts with a very unique, funny idea, and it does not disappoint in terms of how good it can be executed. Nevertheless, Gibson does a good job and is able to produce many a smile with his feminine antics. On and off the camera, he has an incredible sense of humor, and he probably improvised some featured gags. The supporting cast is full of big stars."
3114,"But he knows that within the limited confines of his environs his skill with the written word means next to nothing in regards to his future, and he sees basketball as the only viable means of doing anything worthwhile with his life. It's clever and effective, and the contrast between the rap at the beginning and the song at the end not only frames the film but underscores the impact of the story, as it succinctly encapsulates the changes in Jamal's life. As far as performances go, Connery makes the most of one of his best roles in years. And it's Connery's superlative performance, through which he conveys the complexities of the character so well, that illuminates the true depth and multi-faceted dimensions of Forrester; it is not only memorable, but worthy of an Oscar. With a manner reminiscent of Cuba Gooding Jr. in ` Boyz N the Hood,' he has a natural acting ability that commands attention, and if his performance here is any indication of his talents (which obviously it must be), then it is safe to say that the cinematic world has certainly just been enriched by his presence."
3115,"' The Gift' is an understated, underrated thriller which succeeds in captivating one's attentions from beginning to end. The film's main strengths are its screenplay, its beautiful mise - en - scene, a strong ensemble cast and a haunting soundtrack (those of you who enjoyed' The Shipping News' will recognise the composer from the lilting score of that film) But perhaps' The Gift' s' main attribute is the presence of the wonderful Cate Blanchett. Cate Blanchett's restrained portrayal of Annie exudes compassion and tenderness, and is integral to the success of the film as a whole. Blanchett, through her unique skill as an actress, manages to make the more fantastical elements of the story not only plausible, but intensely moving. In short,' The Gift' is well worth seeing, primarily for Cate Blanchett, but also for the supporting actors Keanu Reeves (very impressive and effective) Hilary Swank (underused) and the magnificent Giovanni Ribisi - who is both explosive and reticent as Buddy Cole."
3116,"The film has excellent acting from Javier Bardem (and smaller but equally excellent performances from Johnny Depp and Sean Penn), wonderful scenery and, most of all, powerful and moving snippets from the work of a novelist whose poetic powers can inspire and lift above the poverty of life or bring emotional poignancy to the depths. But what really drives it and makes it so compelling, is Bardem's incredible portrayal of Arenas. The cinematography is innovative and excellent, audiences have seen few examples of the photography used in this film. Incredible central performance from Javier Bardem ties the film together and makes you really care what happens. And to top it all off, Julian Schanbel does a perfect job of directing, showing Arenas's life with a beautiful new narrative technique, while at the same time showing the contrast of the Revolution and it's events and the beautiful Cuban country."
3118,"The frequent flier miles and first class upgrades, and huge bonuses are all gone but not missed. Cage slowly learns that he is really a married man with a family and instead of a big time corporate president, he is a tire salesman in his father - in - law's store. There are several hilarious scenes and some very touching ones. Have always been a great admirer of Tea Leoni, (Kate Reynolds), "" The Naked Truth "", '95 TV Series (Nora Wilde), she had a great TV series and was very funny and sexy. Nicolas Cage (Jack Campbell), "" Snake Eyes "", '88 gave an excellent performance as a Wall Street Giant and a simple down to earth Tire Salesman."
3119,"Part of Guilded Age / Edwardian upper - crust behaviour was the semblance of civility under the most trying of circumstances, such as saying "" Thank You "" when you've just been fired or otherwise dissed. One of the brilliant aspects of casting is the Gillian Anderson pick. Instead of a brilliant blonde or smouldering brunette, you have a non-conventional look (short, voluptuos and red - headed) that jolts (and excites) the modern eye, but actually better fit in to the pre-Chanel standard of beauty of that time. At its heart the novel is a morality tale, describing the pitfalls of being beautiful, manipulative and shallow while failing to be cunning and wise. Lavish sets, beautiful backdrops, gorgeous costumes, good acting (with the possible exception of Akroyd), all make this a surreal, if sad, journey for the cognitively aware and patient."
3120,"She's never even worn a dress, much less makeup and accessories, and the results are hilarious as she tries to do her job and be a credible contestant as well. Bullock is finally in her element in this flick which sports a lively screeplay, a clever script with lots of "" call backs "", and a good supporting cast. A must see for Bullock fans and a fun watch for most others. Benjamin Bratt, playing a kind of distant love interest for Bullock's FBI agent cum beauty contestant, is a little to aware of his good looks and doesn't quite relax enough to make him a star. This movie is meant to play off the stereotypes of what the contestants are often like, and it provides for some pretty good fodder."
3122,"Once again, someone in Hollywood dares to create something different. Fargo is gray / white, Lebowski is bright orange, and this movie is a pleasant yellow. It's one of those rare movies these days - it's witty, intelligent and vastly entertaining. The bright pleasant qualities of this movie start right away. It is one of the most plainly enjoyable movies to have come out in recent times, intelligent, well - crafted, clever and superbly acted."
3123,"It's very witty, very original and he has certain trademarks, like quick exchanges of dialogue between actors and repeating of the same sentence of dialogue in a group of lines. There are many interesting, memorable quotes. Not only is it well - performed, but it's well - written (lots of comedies only contain one of those factors). If you want to see great performances and laugh at good, tasteful humor--you can't go wrong! Thrown out of their New Hampshire shooting location (for undisclosed misdeeds), a Hollywood film crew lands in a small Vermont town to finish their movie."
3124,"good angle: it helped to explain the vampires aversion to all things holy and dislike of silver (as in 30 pieces of.) Someone on the creative team of this film has a sweet little visual gag in store. Also conflicted is the wonderful Christopher Plummer, who is so present in the role of Van Helsing that he really sells the premise of the whole re-invention in the film's first few minutes. For levity, Dracula's new brood of followers have a lot of trendy, new - age comments to make on the pluses and minuses of their new, undead status. Plummer works (despite the accent); Omar Epps is having a whale of a time; Justine Wadell is good and Esposito, Ryan and Fitzpatrick make a good team of scary (and sexy) vampires."
3125,"It is the story of a very compassionate man that sees the honest darkness of those around him and must face the consequences of his actions. Finally, Billy Bob did a great job of casting the rest of this film to bring the images and feelings of the time period to light. He is constantly experimenting with genres and styles, and this film shows that he can break traditional boundaries. It was as if they were polar opposites, but yet they were perfectly matched. Even great film makers slip every now and then."
3126,"The fact of JFK's assassination, and especially the highly mysterious circumstances surrounding it, has resulted in a very distinct historical niche being carved around him. Which is why "" Thirteen Days "" is such a treat. The discovery of nuclear fission reactions has forever changed the face of warfare, because there now exists an ultimate solution so terrible it is almost beyond contemplation. America was then, and remains now, the most powerful nation on the planet, and yet a single wrong move could have ended all that, and at the cost of millions of innocent lives. The picture is packed with suspense, drama, historical deeds and is quite entertaining."
3127,"Now, with the release of his latest film, Traffic, Soderbergh stands to earn Oscar nominations for Best Director and Best Picture for both of these movies. Benicio's been an indie stalwart for years, but this film should shoot his stock through the roof. The movie is visually stunning, loved the different filters for the three locations. Zeta - Jones and Del Toro have both received Golden Globe nominations for Best Supporting Actress and Actor in a drama for their roles in this film. Early in the year 2000, director Steven Soderbergh's film, Erin Brokovich, sizzled at the box office (bringing in over $130 million) while receiving critical acclaim."
3128,"Kinski, first strong and bitter gives one of her most tender heartbreaking performances, Wes Bentley, likable and promising becomes petty and meddlesome. It has its flaws certainly - for instance, Wes Bentley's character doesn't really convince - but its positives far outweigh those: it looks great, the performances are excellent, and it's moving without being sentimental. It adds greatly to the film's believability, as well as reminding the viewer that these were people who left their homelands, usually to escape extreme poverty, and started a new life in what was (to the white man) unknown territory; this utter anonymity helps explain the actions of some of the characters in the film. Great credit is also due to the actors, excellent performances all round. The most compelling of these is Dillon, a figure of almost tragic proportions, a man who seizes the chance to make amends for his heinous sin, yet who discovers, all too late, that, for some sins, there can be no redemption."
3129,"E. Elias Merhige's intensely imaginative "" Shadow of the Vampire "" offers an intriguing explanation of the film's creepy hold. Merhige helms this material marvelously, conveying a sense of menace and impending doom that make this a genuine horror film in addition to a clever meditation on the form. The supporting cast does a uniformly fine job, particularly Udo Kier, who invests "" Nosferatu ""'s producer, Albin Grau, with unspoken secrets that exist only behind his haunting eyes. This film, however, is really a showcase for Malkovich and Dafoe, who deliver two knockout performances. Dafoe, buried under a ton of makeup, projects a real character through his fangs and hissing, making Schreck pitiable, powerful, and frightening all at once."
3143,"Writer / director Henry Bromell has fashioned a dark, disturbing tale of a man named Alex (William H. Macy) who seeks the professional help of a therapist played by John Ritter. Alex's problem is a decidedly unique one: it seems that, since he's been a teen, he has served as hit man for his father (Donald Sutherland) whose mysterious, shady ` business' apparently calls for the elimination of certain parties at the request of unknown ` clients . ' Alex is a seemingly good man, devoted to his wife and son, who has somehow found a way to distance himself emotionally and morally from the heinous crimes he commits. But in many ways, Alex is actually a man of strong moral character in certain aspects of his life and he agonizes over taking the initial step towards consummating their relationship, knowing it will harm the wife he loves but no longer feels attracted to. The performances from every member of the cast (right on down to little David Dorfman) are letter perfect."
3154,"That is a thing to treasure, a movie that knows enough what it is about to offer closure, yet leave your mind free to wander over the relationships and lives of the people you have just watched briefly from a distance, and reflect on possible meanings. From that point onwards Harry was always there, remembering word for word a poem that Michele had written while at school, remembering Michele's story written years before. The director Dominik Voll preferred to leave high and dry Harry's origins and it's better this way because the spectator can imagine whatever he wants about him. "" With a friend like Harry "" is Voll's second film in six years but his making is absolutely awesome. One of the first moments of this movie makes inevitably think of "" Shining "" (1980) by Stanley Kubrick and "" Funny Games "" (1997) by Michael Haneke: an aerial shot which follows a car on the highway."
3205,"The constellation of excellent actors and actresses is amazing. Only the character of John Turturro disappoints a little bit, but when Woody Allen appears in scene, there are fantastic ironic dialogs. In view of the fact that the CIA is being the fall guy for the Bush gang's insistence on invading Iraq, you'll find this depiction of the beaurocratic idiocies of' the company' to be truthful AND funny. Who cares if the premise is absurd and the movie is episodic, there's some hilarious material here, and stars like Sigourney Weaver, Woody Allen, John Turturro and others are very funny. In fact, all the cast is absolutely magnificent and it consists of Paul Guilfoyle, John Torturro, Alan Cumming, Ryan Phillippe and the fabulous Anthony LaPaglia as Fidel Castro."
3197,"The main event of the story is the rapture - where all the "" good "" people are simultaneously taken to heaven by Jesus. the cast is solid; however, the screenplay in both movies gives the actors little opportunity to really stretch themselves. There are certainly plenty of Christian materials worthy enough to be made into movies. While leaving out minor details, it includes many of the prominent aspects of the book's apocalyptic nature, giving it an air of realism."
3199,"Third, there is the haunting score by Michael Galasso, which is accompanied by slow motion sequences of, e. g. Chan walking in her elegant dresses, Chan and Chow "" glancing "" at each other as they pass one another on the stairs, and other beautiful scenes which etch themselves into one's memory. The plot even resembles something that Duras could have written: Mr. Chow and Mrs. Su Li - zhen, neighbors in a tenement apartment while both being fairly successful professionals, begin to discover in the most banal of ways that their spouses are cheating on them, and they discover quite naturally, it's with each other. First, the specific period of the film (i. e. 1960's Hong Kong) is faithfully recreated to an astonishing degree of detail. Second, Christopher Doyle's award - winning, breathtakingly beautiful cinematography creates an environment which not only envelopes its two main characters, but seems to ooze with romantic longing in every one of its sumptuous, meticulously composed frame. In the Mood for Love is about the doomed romance between two neighbors ("" Mr. Chow, "" played by Tony Leung and "" Mrs. Chan, "" played by Maggie Cheung), whose spouses are having an illicit affair, as they try "" not to be like them . """
3200,"It's a quiet, understated film that finds beauty and grace in very unlikely places. it is certainly NOT a "" tragi - comic, romantic whodunnit "", despite the IMDb plot summary. The plot is fairly intriguing--Hardass cop Mel Gibson is investigating the mysterious death of a tycoon's prodigal junkie son. The film works because of the engaging oddball characters (especially Peter Stormare as an obsessive Beatles fan and Jimmy Smits as a bizarre Native American "" artist ""), because of the brilliantly surreal, postapocalyptic cinematography, and because the sheer naked unhappiness of the film crawls inside of you and doesn't go away for several days. but it's one of the most touching love scenes ever captured on film."
3214,"Or perhaps it is the film makers' extraordinary ability to draw from the people involved an honesty and openness which is as impressive as it is devastating to watch. The point of both the hearings in the film and of the film itself is to be able to heal by facing the truth. This is a trans - formative film that touches deep and complex emotions. The power of this remarkable film comes from the ability of the families and friends of the victims to forgive. Ms. Hoffman, who was already nominated for a profound and excellent documentary about her mother's decline into Alzheimer's, is one of the finest living documentary makers in this country."
3215,"There are all sorts of references to Hollywood classics and non-film buffs will be driven mad by their film friends digging them in the ribs with an excited ` oh that's from ` Sunset Boulevard', or ` African Queen' ` or wherever. Generally though it is different enough to carry it through the weak spots where the plot suddenly starts to do something of consequence. The support cast are all pretty good and are rewarded with having the side - jokes to make away from the responsibility of carrying the main plot â€“ Mclynn of Father Ted fame is probably the most recognisable face. The spirit of rebellion infects Brendan's mother, who starts to use words you don't expect Irish mothers to use. Those that liked his Barrytown Trilogy (The Commitments, The Snapper, The Van) novels or films, will like this as well."
3255,"Being heavily promoted as "" from the makers of' The Castle' "" may get a few extra punters in the door - particularly here in Australia where the exploits of the Working Dog team are rightly well known and loved; but those expecting "" The Castle 2 "" will be in for a surprise. As is to be expected, the writing here is very sharp - a likeable group of characters are defined very well very quickly, the simple plot flows smoothly, and there is a constant stream of funny (and some downright hilarious) moments. Those looking for a comedy will find many laughs herein. In short, "" The Dish "" is one of those rare movies which will appeal to pretty much everyone. A light hearted and fun romp involving the scientists and the townsfolk, all buoyed by pride over their big dish and involvement with the historical NASA mission, "" The Dish "" relies heavily on the viewers sense of awe and nostalgia as the ""."
3256,"Showing some of the scenes in chronological order (BTW, the use of B&W instead of color to make the time distinction was ingenious) creates suspense which builds as the two timelines converge. The way Leonard tries to remember things in the present and the future, via notes tattoos and photographs, making them an important element within the movie. The film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of Leonard Shelby, beautifully played by Guy Pierce. Perhaps it didn't caught much attention at first but now it is in an important position at the IMDb top 250 and that means that most the people recognize great movies when they see them. Carrie - Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano (both of The Matrix) put in great performances that leave you guessing; simultaneously endearing and revolting."
3263,"The juxtaposition of places and footage makes it interesting, and the soundtrack adds to it, but the movie itself comes off as laughable. That the doc follows the man who lived these experiences decades later as he revisits the primitive locales only further underlines the profound impacts his travels had on his life and makes the contrast even more stark. Tobias makes a compelling subject for study as the experiences he faced in immersing himself in these two tribal societies has left him fundamentally changed. Even so, Schneebaum himself has moved into a kind of higher innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness. Yet Tobias' constant wonder and appreciation for the places he got to know is admirable and a real pleasure to watch."
3266,"And even four years later, Pokemon 3 still delivered the thrills. Loaded with excellent animation, some tense battle scenes (Charizard vs. Entei, anyone?) It contained everything that makes Pokemon great. All Pokemon fans will love it, young & old. Substitute a snow castle for a crystal palace, add in PokÃ©mon and surreal dream manipulation and you are in for an imaginative adventure."
3270,"Inflicting pain (on himself * and * others) seems to be what he is best at and he gets plenty of opportunities to show his stuff. Eric Bana's performance is simply awe inspiring and the supporting characters and performances throughout are believable, convincing and multi-layered. This movie makes you think, and it's more than just good fights and death scenes, it's really artful. Chopper is an amazing piece of filmmaking in nearly every regard and goes beyond the limitations of vernaculars. Within the first few moments Eric Bana establishes Chopper's character in a way that reveals the off kilter charisma that some simply cannot resist."
3271,"One feature of the film that is part and parcel of its roving camera approach is that there is very little in the way of exposition or denouement in any of the narrative threads. Iranian director Jafar Panahi's Golden Lion winner of 2000, "" Dayereh "", is a critical and extremely powerful film about women who suffer from the injustices of the laws of the Islamic Republic. Like Mohsen Makhmalbaf and Abbas Kiarostami before him, Jafar Panahi has succeeded in producing a small, but superb film. This is also a marvellous success for the director Panahi. Panahi did a great job showing the truth."
3281,"Eureka's plot is a simple, its action, dialog and soundtrack is sparse, camera movement is minimal. And in this respect, the movement of Eureka mirrors that of the protagonists, the three traumatised survivors of a bloody bus high - jacking. As may be gathered, this film is very much about the aftermath of tragedy, about how certain experiences may mark one off from the rest of society, and how with silence, stillness and human company, and most importantly, the passing of time, some form of healing may be glimpsed. EUREKA is a movie of epic length, that raises other challenging questions like "" Why is it 3. Eureka (Shinji Aoyama, 2000) (spoilers) Together with "" Gaichu "", this film shows Aoi Miyazaki to be one of the finest child actresses of all time."
3300,"The best remedy for the situation is certainly a matter for debate, but no matter what your political slant or position on labor unions and illegal immigrants, you will most definitely find food for thought herein. The cast, many of whom really are janitors and custodians, are as real as it gets. By treating these characters with respect and making them fully - fleshed out, it made the passion of the organizers for this particular cause more understandable, and not just as sometimes seems the case in some portrayals, a matter of someone who is bored or spoiled or has some sort of guilt - complex trying to find their identity and using do - gooderism as a means to that end. Through coming out from the shadows, and joining the great and messy American experience of organized dissent, you could practically see some of these characters changing into ` Americans' before your eyes, no matter what their official papers might say. And self - righteousness is probably an easy trap to fall into for union organizers when the odds against their victories are so high; they gotta find some reason to continue this hard work!"
3301,"One intellectual in the stranded group suggests the performance of King Lear to keep the morale of the survivors. The story has a breathless beginning with the driver absolutely lost and the despair of the passengers and is raw and disturbing, when the survivors return to a primitive stage of human condition. The performances are outstanding and this Dogma 85 film was released in Brazil on VHS by Cult Films Distributor. That's why Dogme is so fantastic. Dogme gives the actors more freedom to develop their characters (like they do in theater)."
3320,"The director's technique of filming a lot through windows and at wide angles gives it an almost voyeuristic feel, but this doesn't alienate the viewer, instead it gives the feeling you're watching real lives unfold, a kind of privileged' fly on the wall' style, and the' slice - of - life' term often used to describe Yi Yi is appropriate. It sounds like a cliche to say it, but it is one of those movies that has everything: cute kids, family dysfunction, reminisces of decisions made in the past, regret, love, hope, and beauty. What happens is very simple--an extended family is portrayed over several months as they enter relationships and life takes its usual tragic - comic toll. Some viewers will surely find it too dull and slow to withstand, but most viewers (the majority) once you give it a chance, will find the humanity bracing, the honesty of the acting and the writing (also by Lang) alive and well. His middle class family is involved with commerce and careers."
3325,"A lovely cross between Meg Ryan - Tom Hanks fluff and "" Northern Exposure "" quirkiness, "" Big Eden "" insists on keeping it merry and informal, confident in knowing that its casual, natural stance on the whole gay element actually gives it universal appeal. Tim DeKay may be eye candy without a shirt for some, but his character is still grounded in reality and he handles that part quite well. "" Big Eden "" is simple yet elegant. Rounding out the cast is the excellent Nan Martin as the marvelously meddlesome Widow Thayer, who gets some of the movie's biggest laughs. Arye Gross fills in for Meg here as Henry Hart, a former citizen of "" Big Eden "" who many years ago moved to the Big City to' be himself'."
3329,"It is a much more realistic portrayal of what normal people do during abnormal times than is the ubiquitous American approach, i. e., any American in trying circumstances morphs into a super hero, albeit usually softly spoken, understated, and of course morally beyond reproach. He and the ensemble cast play every beat of the story just right (there's even one moment midway through where the audience are maybe allowed to get a bit too far ahead of Polivka's character, but it's remedied by the performances). Just saw this on BBC4 - extraordinary - it's the kind of achievement American (and British) screenwriters should practice for years to emulate. This is immediately followed by another fine piece of acting when Josef steps into the doorframe, sees what's going on (i. e. that David is under the sheets), and goes from shock to fear to panic to decisiveness, suddenly breaking into a manic drunken look and dancing foolishly and singing a' funny' Nazi song. The mix of laugh - out - loud humour, gripping thriller, and finally a well - earned and unsentimental tear - jerker of a last 15 minutes is the zenith of a movie - watching experience."
3349,"Issues of race, age, monogamy, relationships, family, marriage, sexuality, homosexuality and HIV are presented in such a natural way that they do not become "" issues "" as in most other gay films, but only various parts of Felix's experiences that make life interesting. The characters in the film are refreshingly realistic; some have tempers, some are sometimes rude and they don't always say or do the right thing. Overall, this is a beautiful, breezy film that has freed itself from the constricting influence of "" gay culture "" - a film that helps you realize that life really has very few limitations. He is unwitting witness to a street crime and gets beaten up himself; he helps an art student do a drawing; and he helps an elderly lady with her bags of groceries. An attractive young man of Arabian descent He charms everyone, including a man who works for the railroad system."
3350,"And the other actors, in their portrayals of fellow gangsters and their lovers, are also excellent. This is one of the best movies of 2000, and is highly recommended. Ian McShane does a lot to bury his lightweight' Lovejoy' persona with an excellent, menacing performance that contrasts well against Winstone's thin bravado, but the honours here have to go to Kingsley who is simply stunning, turning in a masterclass performance and proving (once again) that he is a top - drawer actor with every aspect of his character (posture; accent; attitude) finally honed and utterly (appallingly) convincing. These more aggressive sections are beautifully contrasted by the' slower' character building sections, which allow Winstone to display his charm to full affect. ` Sexy Beast' provides superb performances, a nasty sense of humor and a fascinating glimpse into the dark side of human nature."
3351,""" The Princess and the Warrior "" upholds the optimistic idea that even when things go bad, life is still worth living, if only to help someone else. Director Tom Tykwer shows again that he can tell stories with heart and soul. The casting is perfect; original in looks and body language, Furmann and Potente grace a modern fairy tale that says, well, something about fate, leaving the past behind, finding what you want right under your nose etc. . It's slow at times, yes, but to the ones with keen eyes it's meditative. A perfect and necessary viewing experience for anyone feeling stuck in the mundane routine of life, thrilling, suspenseful, almost painfully aware of what it feels like to be emotionally and spiritually lost."
3353,"The suspenseful story, IMO often wrongfully compared to David Fincher's' Se7en' because of its seemingly similar thematic elements, is set in the French Alps, in the fictitious towns of Guernon and Sarzac. The plot is based on a novel by Jean - Christophe Grange who, together with director Mathieu Kassovitz, also developed the screenplay. Neither the university officials nor the students prove to be too helpful during the investigation and Niemans soon gets the impression that there is something very suspicious about the whole situation. The acting is simply excellent: Jean Reno portrays Niemans as a surly, reserved but brilliant professional with an attitude that often offends the people around him, even if he does not mean to. Vincent Cassel is Max Kerkerian, a quite lively character, sharp - witted but at times lacking self - control and totally unconventional in his methods (the book even mentions him being a former car - thief)."
3354,"The film and life of Lumumba is a lesson of how badly things can go wrong in a climate of conflicting objectives and numerous parties and forces acting in a volatile setting. They come off used and abused, (best example in the movie when GÃ©nÃ©ral Janssens tells his black troops your government lied to you and it leaves them all in an uproar) they are always being pulled and pushed into supporting this person or another. Others have commented on the evenhandedness with which the film "" Lumumba "" treats the parties concerned: Lumumba - supporters, other Congolese, even Belgians."
3358,0 average makes also clear that most of the people are still filled with tabboos. BAISE - MOI is a rare film that utterly achieves what it sets out to do and it bodes well for debut cinÃ©astes Despentes (author of the sulfurous source novel) and ex-porn star Coralie. The best known examples of course are the film protests in 1968 â€“ a time when everyone was protesting about everything. The reality is that most rape victims are traumatised mentally and emotionally. Few rape victims take on such a masculinised determination to succeed against the odds.
3359,"As Hai does push - ups, lien stretches, her graceful Tai Chi movements beautifully choreographed to the rhythm of The Velvet Underground. Cinematographer Mark Lee Ping - Bin who filmed Flowers of Shanghai and In the Mood for Love washes the scene in a glow of different shades of green as they joke and tell stories about their longing to fry the male anatomy in garlic."
3523,"' Beat' Takeshi was just brilliant in the role of Aniki. It's a sign of a great actor when he can command your attention without really doing anything. In terms of introduction of the characters and their interactions, the story closes in reverse really nicely. The movie is mostly made up of deadpan scenes of bloody violence, occasional dialogue, and quiet medium closeups. Brother is great for fans of crime movies, gangsters, violence overall, Asian cinema, and even action fans, but Takeshi Kitano's style is a strangely deadpan and very personal approach."
3527,"Pane e tulipani or Bread and Tulips is a wonderful Italian movie. She meets some interesting people and in one way or another she always influences their lives. But not only their lives change, her life is influenced by it as well. Ganz is a marvel of understated acting, a perfect companion to the romantic Rosealba. ' ` Bread and Tulips' received several David Di Donatello Awards, the Italian version of the Oscars, for best picture, actor, actress, supporting actor, supporting actress, director, and three others."
3584,"The players do a capable enough job getting attuned to the dramatic possibilities. The cinematic solution is to show the current love in terms of recalled images. Some of those are lovely: the hazy romance of the engaging, photogenic Kirstien Van Pellicom. But the Aussies not only took it on but executed it splendidly and sensitively. The performances of Tingwell, Blake and Norris are outstanding, and the scenes of intimacy are tasteful and beautiful."
3590,"This movie successfully ventures into interesting and largely untested ground. Both Tomei and D'Onofrio turn in excellent performances. In spite of their differences, and the many questions in Ruby's mind, the relationship between these seemingly different characters, are never quite solved, but it's easy to see why she is attracted to a man that clearly loves her. The Sam of Vincent D'Onofrio is also right because he gives the character a whimsical quality that wins Ruby's love. Tovah Feldshuh is seen as Ruby's mother, in a winning performance and Nadia Najani plays Gretchen, the best friend anyone can ask for."
3591,"She's a Barbiesque beauty who's avoiding the advances of a charismatic actor while trying to conceive. A fun frolic through the camp and corny, "" Maybe Baby "" is about 80% comedy with the remaining 20% spread over drama, pathos, romance, contemplations about married life, etc. resulting in a light hearted romp which should play well with more mature married - with - kids types, especially females into English humor, in spite of lukewarm critical reviews. The story involves an infertile couple who go to extremes in an attempt to get pregnant though they are both healthy and individually capable of procreating. The semi-cameo (and slightly camp) performances by Dawn French, Joanna Lumley, Emma Thompson and Rowan Atkinson made for fun entertainment as well. Three ladies are sitting together, transfixed as a handsome young actor seductively recites a poem to them."
3592,"There are just too many characters and he can't focus on them all, the film is essentially a snapshot of their lives over the space of a turbulent few weeks. They are welcomed by the group composed of a new - lesbian Anna (Jessica Liedberg), her "" almost gay "" husband and their children; a gay; and an idealist communist. Eva becomes friend of her neighbor Fredrik, and with the new - arrivals in the commune, lives of the members change. "" Tillsammans "" is a delightful dramatic comedy of this great Swedish director Lukas Moodysson. The story is very human and engaging, with many characters very well - developed that find themselves in a world of freedom and without repression, changing their behaviors and improving as human beings."
3620,"Shackelton is portrayed as the excellent leader that he was, but is not presented as an infallible genius. Keeping them from self destructing and working towards the common mission was an amazing accomplishment. Everyone who is going through troubles and is in a position of leadership can easily spot parallels to their own situation in the movie. Shackelton was an adventurer looking for greatness in perhaps the last great uncharted portion of the earth at that time. The scenery is breathtaking, and you get a real feel for how desperate these mens' circumstances really were."
3606,"Bess Armstrong, makes the most with the small role of Katie, the woman who meets Eddie in the worst possible circumstances, but immediately recognizes this man is honest and decent. First time auteur, and diamond business scion, Daniel Cohen, has taken a similar situation of an aging road warrior (brilliantly subtle Robert Forster) and his apprentice (Donnie Wahlberg, with his brother's smiling charm and with NKOTB far behind) and the women they love and leave, and brought forth the shining humanity. "" Diamond Men "" is a slice - of - life flick about an aging traveling diamond salesman (Forster), his protege (Wahlberg), and their experiences on the road. There are few characters in this terrific movie and it's a joy to follow these two diamond salesmen as they hit the road to make sales. In spite of being a good natured light drama with a heart, "" Diamond Men "" can't escape its amateurish screen play and obvious low budgetness as it wanders through fields of pure corn all the way to its feel good conclusion."
3607,"The Iron Ladies truly delivers on all accounts. Cross-dressing Jung (Chaicharn Nimpulsawasdi), make - up loving soldier Nong (Giorgio Maiocchi) and transsexual cabaret star Pia (Kokkorn Benjathikoon) are the standouts in this hilarious cast of characters who unite together to overcome the adversity they face on a daily basis, and take Thailand by storm. Shiriohana Hongsopon gives probably the best performance as Coach Bee, the glue that holds the often hot - tempered and always effervescent team together. For it's fantastic script, three stars. If you don't mind watching a film with subtitles The Iron Ladies is a great feel - good film."
3609,"At the time of the action, Pablo Escobar's empire has been dismantled and his loyal soldiers are scattered all around the city engaging in a game of death, revenge and petty vendettas. Mr. Jaramillo's take on Fernando keeps him away from the confrontations between his young lovers and what he thinks is right. This film is strong and profound, it should be forced on all news spokesmen with Colombian corpses in the background: ` Lady this is Medellin, not Switzerland'. In a homosexual brothel meets and befriends Alexis (Anderson) a teen at 16 years old and starts a romance with him."
3612,"This documentary is made more effective by snap - shots of the children, archival footage of Nazi Germany during the late 1930's (a veritable sewer of anti-Jewish destruction and propaganda), and in this context, the painfully frightening sound effects of broken glass, trains and the voices of children singing in German, which seem strangely perverted; an unfortunate consequence which Germans should never forgive the Nazi's. One boy, after being placed with a family in England for 6 or 7 years during WWII, finally got the miracle of meeting his parents again after they had somehow come through the war."
3615,"There is clatter and chatter, laughter and fisticuffs. Idle gossip among the clients and smart remarks to the staff about the appropriateness of hanging oil paintings in a restaurant. The cameras constantly switch from dining room to kitchen and kitchen to dining room maintaining a lively feeling of urgency as the trays are carried up the stairs. The wonderful, winsome multi-ethnic ensemble of mostly New York actors--many born in Brooklyn according to the IMDb--who have done a lot of TV work are clearly enjoying making a movie as a coordinated team. The upstairs / downstairs of the kitchen scrambles vs. the dining pleasures and everyone's personal spices are lots of fun."
3717,"For those who love awful movies and wonder who the heck makes this crap then they have a true hero in Morty Fineman, a man ahead of his times."
3745,"This is possibly Svankmajers most accessible feature film, as it follows a simple linear narrative on a parallel to a fairytale discovered by one character. After a few exasperated protests from the skeptical father, she takes it home with her and the couple goes to great lengths to conceal the young root baby from the prying eyes of the neighbours. "" OtesÃ¡nek "" is funny, most of all â€“ part ironic fantasy and part low - key farce, even if there are genuine moments of pathos and horror. But overall, it's an extremely watchable film, with good performances by the three principals, and a delightful black comic energy. He's actually an excellent live - action director as well, which Little Otik (in Czech "" Otesanek, "" "" Greedy Guts, "" the name of an Eastern European fairy tale from which the script is adapted) demonstrates."
3781,"There were just so many moments of geniune warmth and humor. Olympia (Anette StÃ¸velbÃ¦k) is a clumsy clerk of a candy shop, who lives with her sullen father and is in love with Andreas (Anders W. Berthelsen), a young widow priest recently arrived in town. This unconventional love story, with euthanasia, common people, losers in general, Danish persons speaking Italian, is actually a great romance. And Sara Indrio Jensen is superb! The dogme style goes well with this story."
3795,"Well, the drawings are amazing too and the characters have rich personalities. Older teens will love it, but smaller children familiar with the series might find the action too intense, some scenes and animation echoing the works of Akira Kurosawa, particularly "" Ran "". For those who have seen the Escaflowne television series know that it was a beautifully complex shoujou anime with plenty of action, adventure, and romance. Hitomi seems to shift from a depressed school girl on the verge of suicide to a strong supportive heroine without much coaxing or personal experience. Though some ` Escaflowne' fans may be disappointed by how much different the movie is, many people will be happy with the style."
3796,"The film does not progress in linear fashion and there are several shifts of time and perspective to keep the viewer on edge. Winner of five major Genie awards in 2001, Maelstrom is a playfully alive but dramatically intense look at the life a pleasure - seeking 25 - year old boutique executive of (Marie Josee Croze) who runs into an emotional storm following an abortion and a fatal accident that she does not report. No earth shattering epiphanies here, but still a solid tale done up in many colours. The ageless fishes presents it all in a very solemn manner, conterbalancing wonderfully with the superficial and aimless modern world in which the characters live. But there are a lot of great moments."
3800,"This movie sits somewhere between reality and fantasy, for it uses both aspects in a beautiful way, somehow finding a perfect point between the two. A hilarious psychological comedy where 4 Calgary coworkers bet on who can go the longest without going outside. The exaggerated personality degradation and hallucinations are funny and successful at drawing the audience into their warped world. P. S. Oh, and the superhero scenes are just awesome! It has some drugs, occasional sex (sorry, no nude), and a lot of laughs."
3842,"Its genre cannot be classified simply horror, and while there are plenty of great action scenes, the near - perfect pacing allows for quiet moments of conversation between the characters. Its full of great moments, but the best is the climactic finale - absolutely unforgettable. A must - see, right up there with classics of anime such as Studio Ghibli's work. In the distant future it's the year 12, 090 where vampires and the undead who caused terror through the night are falling at a rapid rate, because of a Dunpeal; half - human, half - vampire bounty hunter called D. On this quest he's hired for 20 millions dollars by a father of a young girl who was kidnapped by a powerful vampire who plans to take her with him to the stars. A really compelling and exciting anime piece that delivers all the goods in a marvellous blend."
3899,"David Gordon Green has a pretty simple formula â€“ not a great deal of extraneous camera movement, realistic characters and scenes that are lyrically cut together with beautifully photographed landscapes. At times, the film is reminiscent of Terence Malick's work with the use of narration, beautifully evocative music, and mesmerizing shots of the landscape. The opening scenes in particular have great cinematography. Though at times self - conscious, George Washington brings to mind Terence Malick's Days of Heaven with its voice - over narration, languid, dreamy tone, and gorgeous cinematography. Instead, it puts the context into comedic relief to see 12 year olds discussing love like aging veterans of break - up and loss."
4039,"One of capitalism's favourite pretences, especially when making bogeymen of alternative ideologies, is that is is natural, the obvious orientation for any society, the inevitable result of progress, while all other systems are theoretical, foreign, applied. The ethics of capitalism are figured in architecture, in the way people compartmentalise and miniaturise their lives, the way they treat other humans, the mechanical way they move. The recurrent motif of the film, besides the endless triangles, is of frames - there is not a single composition that doesn't give onto other frames: windows, doorways, corridors, elevators, streets, etc. - like a kaleidoscope, the mere switching on of a light can radically reconfigure these spatial arrangements. Because this way of life is made to seem natural, feeding into the very buildings in, and gestures with, which people live, its collapse is not sparked by an external force, but results in an implosion of the environment, buildings toppling, the ground tilting like a sinking ship, the body, mind and society breaking down, a whole world grinding towards sterility and inertia. The narrative consists of connected, but self - contained vignettes or sketches with a recurring set of characters."
4041,"The performances, particularly that of Isabelle Huppert, are about the only thing to recommend this film. One can even go to the extent of analyzing this by saying that Mika is the black widow and AndrÃ© finds her irresistible. Jeanne meet AndrÃ© and his wife "" Mika "" Muller (Isabelle Huppert) and their son and on the way uncover the fact that there are some secrets in that family as much in her own. When she sees the photo of Lisbeth in the bedroom, she returns to the pianos room where AndrÃ© is and puts her hands on her face exactly the same way Lisbeth did."
4176,"Rich brings his girlfriend Adaline Gunne (the delicious Elizabeth Hurley), who is a fan of Thomas and tries to seduce him, playing erotic games. This is a rather somber, mood piece from Bigelow, whose reputation as a keen director of action movies is only briefly apparent in this subdued thriller. Accompanying her on her quest are her husband, Thomas, a celebrated poet; Rich, his handsome brother whose boat they use to get to the island; and Adaline, the latter's gorgeous girlfriend who also happens to be a devotee of Thomas' literary work and a bit of a ` groupie,' as it turns out, in both tone and temperament, attaching herself rather obviously to the talented young bard, despite the fact that his observant wife is on the boat with them."
4416,"Although all performances are wonderful, a special mention must go to Ole Thestrup who plays local game hunter Alfred. Yes, there are parts of the film which can be quite sad, especially if one can relate in any way to them, but by and large, this is a very funny film that is definitely worth the DVD rental. The characterizations are brilliant and the producers deserve a medal for having the courage to attempt a piece so violent (at times) and so utterly human. "" Blinkende Lygter "" (' blinking lights') is extremely original in its odyssey through several genres; starting off as a gangster movie, passing close by a road movie (until the car breaks down), and then completely shifting pace and content in a very surprising and humorous way. His reaction to an offer of firearms in exchange for the life of his cow is priceless."
4577,"Apart from a few montages (comprised of photos taken by one of the film's many peripheral characters), almost every scene is composed in one long, carefully orchestrated shot. Throughout the film, complex social issues such as xenophobia, vagrancy, and familial strife are explored; however the film's effectiveness lies in its ability to portray the sense of homelessness often described as an inevitability of today's consumerist, globalist culture. In this Haneke's opus, there's neither the uppercut of "" Benny's video "" (1992), nor the icy violence of "" Funny Games "" (1997) but through an accurate study of these different journeys, a quiet, impressive of rigor making, the director offers a disillusioned and black vision of this society. "" Unknown Code: Incomplete Tales of Several Journeys (Code inconnu: RÃ©cit incomplet de divers voyages) "" is a fascinating exploration of communication, using all the elements of film to create a trompe l'oeil of sight, sound and character interactions. Or he plays ironic tricks â€“ having deaf kids do emotional charades or perform in a marching drum band or creating ambiguity about a door entry code to reinforce a theme of restless homelessness."
4651,"Filled with incredible action sequences, mind blowing stunts, and interesting characters, Seunlau ngaklau is up there on the same level with Matrix, without appearing at all artificial or contrived. Plus, it's directed by Tsui Hark - who has done excellent work with The Legend Of Zu and other such movies. Watching Time and Tide is akin to being in a taxicab with a driver, who knows what his final destination is but has no idea how to get there, drives around really fast and somehow makes it to the end--this is not to be said as an insult, but a testament to his skill. Hong Kong filmakers are great experimenters with perspective. So basically look for the action scenes and good performances by Tse, Wu Bai, Lo, and Liu."
4661,"The teens act and talk like REAL PEOPLE, and the honesty about sex, drugs and puberty is rarely seen in contemporary movies, horror or otherwise. A welcome change from the usual generic American offerings, this Canadian take on moody teens and the horrors of growing up has a laid - back, low - budget feel to it. The monster looks a bit plastic - y but the film is really about the sisters, and both roles are admirably filled by two capable but very different young starlets. Perkins is compelling as the awkward, introverted class nerd, and Isabelle magnificent as the slightly scary, sexy, ex-nerd who turns into a real man - eater. Together they share a fascination for bloody re-enactments of death, and their scenes together are outstanding - if you're not too squeamish."
4765,"Adults and children alike read comics by the droves, and sometimes pops up a strange, not - too - well - hidden undercurrent of pedophilia. From a frustrated and humiliated teacher; to students killing each other over seemingly unimportant squabbles; to the overly - cutesy, peppy training video that perfectly mimics nearly any show on NHK these days--this film subtly and brilliantly comments on half - a-dozen issues that weigh heavily on the minds of Japanese people today. From the opening scene with the stunning use of visual and audio techniques, when the winner of last years game is presented to the press, to the taunting instruction video in how to play Battle Royale properly, the movie seems to take a bite at every aspect of the Japanese and perhaps even the western culture. Kitano's presentation rises well over the other actors mainly because of the talent that he has attained over the years of cinema and theatre, his other movie roles include the renowned ` Hana - Bi' and ` Brother' which he directed himself. Sure, these weapons are also on the streets and in some parts of the world they are even in the hands of children as young as five years - old but the videogame set up creates a comfortable experience with such weapons."
4904,"Eminem is entertaining (though redundant), so fans might want fast forward to his segments, should they find the movie lying in a gutter somewhere (a likely situation). After a while he would have had a good 30 minutes of comments by rappers, some very famous, about the' hip hop witch', and he figured that knocking together some half plot and releasing the' star studded' film would mean instant success. You know how some movies you can watch and it makes you feel good? The other rappers are no better, for people who are or were' scared to death by the witch' they seem to find the whole thing remarkably funny, they laugh while describing their' horrible near death experiences'. On the upside, it does have a great many R&B artists."
4988,"This, in the context of Matt's indefensible behavior; he consistently deceives the 100 girls, gaining their trust under false pretenses, breaking into their rooms and violating their privacy in various and sundry other ways. There are a lot of clichÃ©s in this film, but some of the bits in it are funny and sometimes downright interesting (while others really horrible)."
5068,"In its defense, however, it contained very high production values, lavish production design, a stellar cast, and much incredible visual imagery that sticks in the mind. The special effects are for the most part CGI and bluescreen and are very effective for the money spent. The calibre of the cast in the first film was so high that they pose a hard mount for any followers to climb. Alec Newman is fairly new to the screen and was a bit old, and not self - absorbed enough, to play Paul as well as Kyle Maclachlan did in 1984, but he has developing charisma and his performance at times radiates Muad' Dib's complexity. The nicest thing, for a fan of the book, is to see so many of the great scenes of the novel finally brought to the screen that could not be included in the two - hour film."
5093,"His original goal in making the film was to fund its denizens' move out of the tunnel. As for the content of the film, it's an incredibly compassionate look into the lives of a few of the many homeless people who lived under New York City in abandoned railway tunnels for decades. The men (and one woman) of this film speak of a life lived autonomous from societal intervention. They are lost souls - shadow people moving through an ethereal, timeless landscape."
5222,"It's a story of two nice people who are getting married to significant others, but who find their soul mates in one another. Olivia d'Abo and Michael Rigoli were fun to watch, even if d'Abo's British accent did creep into her supposed Bronx speech. There is simmering chemistry between the two leads; the film is most alive when they share a scene - lots! Jim Larson's comments about it being a "" sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths "" were dead on. The locales are nice, the characters are likable and goodlooking and the supporting actors are pretty good."
5261,"The story then divides into a bunch of individual tales about the people on the Metro platform, with each tale in one small way moving the girl closer to meeting her intended. A lot of hilarious and unexpected belly - laughs. When a butterfly beats its' wings on one side of the Pacific it creates a tidal wave on the other side. A very funny charmer with the gorgeous Audrey Tautou who has all of the delightful screen persona of that other unforgettable Audrey. A really nice and enertaining 93 minutes."
5308,"The film is ambitious in making a statement about the struggle for African Americans to not only gain a place in the entertainment industry, but to be able to produce quality shows without network tampering. Touching performances and an intriguing subject matter make for a fine film that Mr. Bythewood should be extremely proud to proclaim his first. All the actors in this movie, even the ones with only a brief amount of screentime, give strong performances. So tragic how the network execs keep saying it is her show and the numbers are good. The lead (who doesn't give a damn about Semaj's "" name or flavour) was also very sympathetic."
5670,"The look of the film is great, with dynamic camera work and beautifully framed scenes. The editing and pace are wonderful, and the music choices are ideal. Hopefully, this film will find greater distribution, and encourage it's filmmakers to make more movies. The whole journey through so many different countries and passing beside so many different people and cultures was really interesting and refreshing, as were all the characters in the movie. Its competitors where among other excellent films "" Love is a bitch "", "" Girl on the bridge "", "" Girl of your dreams "", "" Her eyes "", "" Mifunes song ""."
5672,"The performances are all top - notch, especially Scott Cohen as Wolf, Ed O'Neill as Relish the Troll King and Rutger Hauer as the Huntsman. The guest stars get to hog the limelight as well. There are a couple of hairy moments (the trial in Little Lamb Village) but overall, you will love this. In this movie there were so many great things that not only brought up childhood memories but it also brought back an imagination to people all over the world. The places where they shot the movie like Austria and england were beautiful scenic areas."
5673,"This movie's greatest assets lies in ace animations and some rather entertaining slapstick. "" A Goofy Movie "", a 1995 animated flick, was the first full - length movie for Goofy, one of Disney's famous cartoon characters, and it was released over sixty years after the character was first introduced. An Extremely Goofy Movie takes place Four or five years after the original and involves Goofy's son Max going off to collage and freedom. Shortly put, this is good clean entertainment for kids as well as parents and teens. The gammas are all about winning at any cost and not above cheating to accomplish that."
5677,"If you are gay, lesbian, or simply sympathetic to the lives and struggles of gays and lesbians, you must watch this film. The extra material added to the interviews is perfectly balanced to put the interviews in their historical and personal context, without unduly expanding the context to overshadow what the (very few) survivors had to tell. It is the story of gays and although briefly, lesbians, during the early Pre-WWII years and also during the war. In this respect, Epstein and Friedman should be largely commended for bringing this subject to the attention of the world, and telling these powerful personal stories before the last survivors die. This documentary centers on six emotional accounts of the most elderly and frail survivors of the concentration camps who, up until now, have repressed their stories."
5687,"is about change: grandma is still firmly rooted in the old ways, dad keeps up appearances but turns out more flexible than you thought and Roro is, for all intents and purposes, just as much a modern Swede as a Lebanese. It shows that love cannot be "" arranged "" or planned, it is born once the two right people meet and there is no need for help from another parties. It took 30 days to shoot the film, and technically the film is very great as there are many different techniques used by the director and the story is also very interesting, and genuinely funny, not some stupid slapstick comedy. On the contrary of Hollywoodian romances, the characters are common people, without fancy cars, expensive cellular and high positions, therefore absolutely believable. Yasmin and Roro agree to pretend that they are going to get married to relieve the pressure of their families, leading them to a great confusion."
5678,"New' evidence' has been discovered, and perhaps the real killer still walks the streets, and it's clear who Berlinger and Sinofsky believes it to be. Harrowing, provocatively - intense and emotionally - charged documentary about the ever so fascinating but disturbing Robin Hood Hills murders case. The three people behind the website are shown at numerous points in the film accepting collect calls from prison from Damien Echols and holding a live, somewhat informal chat through their website. In one scene he goes as far as setting up fake graves for Baldwin, Echols, and Misskelley Jr. and proceeds to douse the graves with lighter fluid before striking a match and incinerating it all. All have grown up a great deal in the 4 years since the last film, and are sad and articulate reminders of how horrifying it can be that people never given the benefit of a fair trial are allowed to sit and rot in prison."
5679,"Even without the controversial subject of the cocklear implant this is a great study in generations as it is the old story of parents either wanting their kids (adult kids) wanting them to either be like them or to have it better than they had it. She is content to take from the Deaf world as an interpreter, but she is also willing to insult it when her own child is born deaf. The film was interesting, but it did not come close to looking at many of the important issues of the Deaf World and CI."
5681,"If you're not the type to concern yourself with sensible details and neat story lines, you may just enjoy the sheer weirdness of Uzumaki. Uzumaki is an entertaining film for any horror fan. A very quirky little film that follows Kirie a cute school girl in a small town in Japan where strange things keep happening, spirals appear in strange places and people take on obsessions with spirals which eventually drive them to their deaths. The film progresses really well from normal life to abnormal phenomena (giant snails and crazy people) to the truly supernatural (walking dead). "" Uzumaki "" is wonderfully photographed and the use of colors is top - notch."
5682,"It also works very well as a moment of character growth for Quinn (Who finally shows that she isn't so shallow as the others think) and Mr. DeMartino, who has the chance to recover his lost love for teaching. Others should have a lot of fun. Daria opens up so far as relationships, but by far the best point is Jane's convictions of who she is and the fact that no one is going to change her mind. This TV movie from the fourth season takes a standard gambit in teen movies - the summer vacation - and turns it into a hilarious and sensitive tale that (unlike "" Is It College Yet? Being perhaps one of the best teen animated series on television and the only program on MTV that deserves attention of anyone with a bit of intelligence is hard enough but Daria continues to impress its viewers with the release of the first original movie "" Is It Fall Yet? """
5685,"Fusing a Hollywood - style' who - dunnit' with an intellectually poignant essay on Korean geopolitics,' Joint Security Area' (' JSA') offered a surprisingly moving twist to an otherwise engaging film. ' JSA' perceptively explored a modern day Korean psyche - that heartfelt desire for kinship and unity between the people of both Koreas. Chan - wook Park's most politically - charged film tackles the very volatile tension that exists between the North and South Koreans. In the beginning of the picture, both sides have a skewed view of one another, seeing each through the lens of their political temperament - the border between the two thus is interpreted as a wall that filters and jades each one's perspective. The characters are richly drawn and dynamic to reflect this - each are humans, with their own unique demeanor, and that their national identity is nothing more than a facade."
5688,"O Auto de Compadecida is a funny film, in more ways than one. "" O Auto da Compadecida "" figures as the best Brazilian comedy of all times, not only for the jokes itself but for the social and economical context that it shows! "" O Auto da Compadecida "" is definitely a very good movie, with talented actors and unexpected plot. If you are still not convinced that this is just one of the best movies ever made, remember that the only Brazilian actress ever nominated to an Oscar is priceless as the Compadecida. That's one of the most funny scenes, he has to be solved in a trial, so that he can goes to Haven."
5689,"The movie finishes on a note, like most anime's do, which leaves you hanging. Although the actors do their best to bring out as much emotion from the characters, the flat dialogue falls squarely on the shoulders of the writers. It has exceedingly smooth animation combined with highly detailed artwork, appealing character designs (a far cry from the cutesy big eyed girls in most anime) and awesome fight choreography. All 48 fricking minutes of its short, well made, coolness. Alas, somebody forgot that what makes a good anime is not just the animation but the story as well, the main thing that distinguishes anime from most other forms of animation."
5873,"Sadako, haunted by frightening visions of ghosts and bloody omens of the future, is a tense and silent girl with an ethereal beauty. This is a strong entry in the Ringu series, more of a psychological drama than anything else. The acting is first rate, especially from Yukie Nakama who gives a subtle performance as Sadako, and everyone else is on form. One of the most underrated horror movies of recent years, mainly because it can seem confusing at first glance, and because very few questions are actually answered. Yukie Nakamo does a wonderful job of portraying the tragic final days of Sadako's attempt at a normal life."
6133,"Leprechaun 'N the Hood is a great movie. Writer Doug Hall had a message he wanted to convey, and thankfully he came into contact with a director the caliber of Rob Spera to help him bring it to the masses. Spera was able to relay Hall's vision in a manner that was both entertaining and touching. The movie alone beats anything Robin Williams, Jim Carrey, Adam Sandler, or Chris Rock have ever done. Several years later, Mack is relishing in his success as a rap - producer thanks to the magical flute, although he also decided to keep the immobile Leprechaun in his living room for safety reasons."
6856,"But only a honest film and this fact is not a error of director or actors, fruit of clichÃ©s but element of special dross. At 3 hrs (vs the uncut 4), it's just right - not much lost, & a whole lot better than the 2 hr versions. Watch him in the last few moments of his Prince's life as he gently rocks Hamlet in his arms. There are bits of action unique to this production that will make you catch your breath."
6876,"Nuremburg goes beyond showing him as the faceless Nazi monster; as a proud soldier and pilot (he was head of the Luftwaffe during WW2, and in WW1, had been a decorated pilot himself), and a man capable of humor and kindness. Also historically correct is the way in which Goering initially made the prosecutors, representing the allied forces, look like idiots, while he endeared himself to everyone in the room with his witty remarks. The friendship between Goering and the American soldier "" Tex "" is also completely true, and the movie insinuates one of the two most popular explanations for how Goering got the cyanide ampule into his cell, despite the fact that it and he were searched regularly. The Soviet prosecutors were also competent and did a good job. An example was the arrival of a Russian government member, who at a meeting with the judges proposed a toast to the' speedy death of all the defendants'."
6992,"Another remarkable Herzog doc, about Juliane Koepcke, the 17 year - old sole survivor of a 1971 plane crash in the Peruvian jungle. The film contains the usual enigmatic Herzogian touches like his poetic narration and strange detours. An upbeat glimmer of innocence in this story of someone facing the abyss and emerging through the other side, haunted forever but still alive. Amazing, hypnotic film who's subject haunted Herzog for decades - he was in the airport at the time the plane took off during his time making Aguirre. But Herzog's midas touch (read: embellishment) transformed those shot footage into a re-enactment of the woman's "" dream sequence' in the final take of Wings of Hope."
7003,"All the music is by Little Richard, so it rocks a tight lipsync on every song. The movie covers his early childhood, carrys thru the formative years in music, the wild success and Richard's throwing it all away to praise the Lord. The best scenes are Richard getting jilted by Lucille and writing a song about it and the strip to bikini shorts while performing, to make the point about not having a decent place to change. It's starts out with Richard's child hood, his infatuation with dressing up in his mother's clothes, his father giving him beatings and the influence of the church. Leon was fantastic as always, this time playing Little Richard in his early years."
7410,"The beauty of the movie is that Danila is not played by Arnold, Vin Diesel or Tom Cruise. America is definitely portrayed from Danila's eyes. In response to Danila's statement to the police, an American (non-Russian speaking) cop hears Danila use the word "" negr . "" Danila's friend is killed for having requested an influential Russian "" banker "" to intervene on American brother's behalf. The Russian and intelligent viewers will understand, also, that Danila comes back from a war."
8348,"It's a good parody of a lot of this bad teenage horror movies. Both have unique sense of humor, it just a shame that SIYKWIDLFtT will only be seen by a few and sadly be wrongly branded as a rip - off just because of circumstance and bad timining. Those movies are just for a thrill and this one is just for fun. which made it a laugh - a-minute ride. The obvious slapstick gags sometimes overshadow the more humourous background references, some of which actually give this film second viewing possibilities."
8534,"A big budget film its not, but based on the circumstances, they did a good job. The kids are actually decent actors and, at times, out - act the adults. T. J. (Grady Hutt) is the optimistic one and tries to get his brother to straighten up so they can have a home. The movie is made better by her tough love portrayal--especially the scenes with the kids."
