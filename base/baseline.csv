4892,"Oh, and it needs to be said: The elephants are awesome. portrait of Thai XVI century, it is a beautiful jewelery, really impressive for each its part. Apparently, Chatrichalerm Yukol, the writer and director is a member of the sprawling Thai royal family (as is SF / Horror writer S. P. Somtow). a testimony of charming potential of South Asian cinema to give a different product by Bollywood. This is a beautiful epic film set in historical Thailand during a turbulent period about 1526AD into the 1530's."
3213,"It works on so many levels. Heidi Klum also makes a special appearance, and sports some outrageous hairdos and costumes. The family is brought back together when the Hair Dressing Championships come to their home town, and Phil, Shelley, Sandra and Brian pool their resources to beat their rivals. The reunion of two childhood friends, Brian and Christina, who rediscover each other as attractive adults of the opposite sex. Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable romp, with some affecting performances."
4887,"Tadanobu Asano is brilliant as Kakihara. There are no subtleties, no off camera goings on; it is all there for the audience to see, in full detail! The acting is surprisingly good - Nao Omori and Tadanobu Asano are impressive as Ichi and Kakihara. In 2001 Japanesse cult director Takashi Miike created one of the most unique and controversial movies ever to grace the screen. But by the final "" act "", there are some very interesting revelations about characters and their relationships to one another."
3994,"A sweet smart little gem which belongs in the collection of every cinema connosuire "" There are truths there to make a revolution. Ian Holm is fantastic as both Napoleon and Lenormand. Ian Holm plays Napoleon and is perfect, as are all his co-stars. He has filled France with widows and orphans!"
3522,"John Cusack and Catherine Zeta - Jones play Eddie Thomas and Gwen Harrison, two movie stars who have been tremendously successful working together and who have worked their way into the heart of the American public. The movie industry inside jokes and details surrounding press junkets are great in the beginning of the movie. The supporting cast is dynamite, Seth Green, Hank Azaria, and Alan Arkin all have memorable and entertaining parts. There are some really funny scenes, but thats about it. Written and produced by Billy Crystal' America's Sweethearts' is a good giggle, and has some fine performances from Cusack, Crystal, Roberts and Jones (Although Catherine Zeta Jones's performance as a press hungry b*tch, is maybe a little too believable)."
3352,"This is a brilliantly funny movie, with some unforgettable moments - particularly the "" testing department "" sequence in the condom factory. The final scene with his ex-wife is powerful. All the pieces fit together so intricately and well and so few liberties were taken of normal human reactions--almost everything was within comfortable bonds of believability. The acting of Auteil, Depardieu and Rocherfort above all is very amusing and good. The story is amusing, the cast are perfect, particularly Gerard Depardieu's hilarious, touching, crazy mixed up macho / gay guy."
3582,"And the fine Greco - Italian supporting cast bring de Berniere's sundrenched world of Cepholonia dazzlingly alive. It's possible to sing and be happy, have good feelings, to love and to be loved in a War time! Working with Madden, the choices for locations on the Greek island of Kefallonia are superb and the visual images that come from photographing these majestic locations in varying light are lush and beautiful. Isn't it just a "" love story "" made up in Hollywood show's standards? Overall, the film takes a satisfying circular route from start to finish, inducing a range of emotions as it progresses."
3837,"Warm fuzzy feelings all the way! The colors were exquisite, the music and dancing delightful and the people gorgeous. As the days pass, family joys and family secrets are revealed. Very refreshing as there are no super stars, no blood, no perfect special effects, no sex. Only a smidgen of a coincidence in the last moments of a too neat happy ending for a very sympathetic character mars the story, but understandably the audience cheers at the end."
3581,"That said, this is still a disturbing, powerful film with scenes which will stay with you for a long time. Movies like this are rare, but making a come - back. However, everything is so well - crafted and executed in this picture, from the writing, cinematography and acting to the use of sound and digital film, that it's a moot point. Session 9 is a welcome return to the type of film whose horror relies not on cheap - thrill multi-decibel glissandos, jump - cuts and viscera (although it has its share of that), but on strong interplay between characters, and the gradual realisation that the worst things you can imagine are not "" out there "", but inside your own mind. While many (including the filmmakers) will find comparisons to Don't Look Now, The Shining, and even a nod to The Changeling, Session 9 still stands on its own as a most effective, brooding experience of dread--and that's a good thing!"
3580,"Their scenes together are funny and poignant at the same time. All in all, a versatile and funny film that is optimistic without nearing sappiness. The acting is exceptional, especially on the part of Cillian Murphy. The dialogues between them are very well written, as are the ones between Jonathan and Rachel (the also good Tricia Vessey). The relationship between him and Dr. Figure gives room for some very witty and at times profound observations."
3212,"The leads, Dunst and Foster, are solid. Kirsten Dunst headlines it, and rightly so. It has more than enough funny moments, and there's a good sense of fun overall. Anyway, it's pleasant, occasionally inventive within the rigid confines of the genre, and has a few big laughs in it. That being said; Get Over It is worth watching if you're after 90 minutes of entertainment."
4008,"Elizabeth is a stray pooch - collecting film actress teetering on the edge of dwindling starletdom. Holofcener has produced a genuinely lovely film; one that portends amazing things yet to come. Chaplin's genius was founded on this blend of emotions. The performances are neat and unshowy, with Catherine Keener reliable as ever as (another) wayward hard - ass, Mulroney playing the roguish fool and Jake Gyllenhaal practising for the role he plays in The Good Girl. Nicole Holofcener's small output prevents making any kind of assumption as yet, but in "" Lovely and Amazing "" she displays remarkable ability in dealing with the pain people (mostly female) experience in grappling with the issue of self esteem."
3579,"That's largely because of the beautiful performances. Tilda Swinton, seen opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in 1999's The Beach, leads the cast with a powerhouse performance. In retrospect, Visnjic does a good job with what he is given to work with. Nevertheless, a compelling script and convincing performances from all the actors make this worth seeing. Isolated by snow - covered mountain tops, ponderosa pines, and upper class wood homes, this is the perfect backdrop for The Deep End."
3588,"Ghosts of Mars fits the bill perfectly. They make one single movie over and over again, reaching outstanding levels of accomplishment in style and coherence. Mars has fascinated humans for years. But if you like great b - movies, go see this movie. As in Hawks, the individuals work as a group, defined by codes of professional skill in a strictly masculine environment."
4902,"It's a mixture of late 50's pompousness and innocence with modern perspective and grace. In short, it is an incredibly accurate and funny send - up of 50's drive - in movies. There are at least two or three very, very funny parts. 10/10 rating Lost Skeleton of Cadavra is a remarkable little film that recreates the look and feel of old low - budget black and white sci fi films, but it has a refreshing spirit all its own that is smart and silly at the same time. Lack of subtlety was a hallmark of such films, and the makers here get it just right."
3797,"The performances and set designs are going to be over the top. The use of body language is tremendous, the light setting perfect, everything well timed and perfectly captured by the camera. Its scope, its reach, its magnitude and its message are truly incredible even by today's standards of film - making. This is one of the most perfect movies of all time, and it deserves anything it can get. This must be one of the greatest movies of all time."
3578,"It becomes like picking up and studying a finely crafted object; it suddenly hits you: hey, there're no seams here, no rough joints; its finish is wonderfully even. The leads are attractive, there's a very strong supporting cast (Doris Roberts, Sasha Alexander, Christina Ricci and Lisa Kudrow in a great cameo) and it's all well - done. Besides, Eli loved Planet Of The Apes memorabilia and that's a nice change from the usual cliched obsessions. The acting is evenly engaging, with cameo appearances by well known actors. It is not as goofy as "" The Opposite of Sex "" (written by this film's Executive Producer, Don Roos), but it has a lot of great laughs."
3577,"The film gets spectacular shoot em' up, thrills, exciting horse pursuits; it's entertaining, although nothing new but displays an ordinary pace and with no originality. Contemporary - style Western with acceptable performances and professional direction by Les Mayfield who creates some good action scenes. The latest iteration of the story is "" American Outlaws "", a red - blooded B - style shoot - 'em - up that offers little in the way of historical accuracy and even less in the way of storytelling elegance, but does serve up plenty of action and lots of fun. There are also some nice performances from the mostly young cast. The film's period accoutrements are all present and accounted for, the costumes and guns appropriately impressive, the cinematography by Russell Boyd all vibrant browns and golds."
4016,"There are some good moments but your definitely left thinking more could have been done. This movie is watchable and enjoyable, thanks to the attractiveness of its stars and Stamp's old - pro performance. All of these ups and downs are presented on a plate, as in a delicious "" tasting meal "" one can savor at a chef - driven restaurant. In real life happy endings to episodes of mounting distrust, approaching paranoia, are few. Director / writer / co-star Yvan Attal is actually married to co-star Charlotte Gainsbourg, an effervescent and shimmering bilingual (French / English) beauty."
4021,"If this was Julio Medem's vision, then it was brilliant. Medem understands all this very well, and his depiction of it is remarkable. This is one of the better structured movies ever put to screen. The camera - work and colors are really great and create a very unique atmosphere for the movie. It helps to make "" LucÃ­a y el sexo "" an even bigger and more enjoyable movie to watch, visually."
3576,"It's one of the most clever films of the year. The characters and backgrounds are allowed to look and move in ways that are downright refreshingly bizarre. Directing a wildly amusing script by Marc Hyman, the Farrelly bothers are really on to something here. Chris Rock and Laurence Fishburne give a great performance with their voices. The Farrley Brothers have done it again - and made a solid B + stand out comedy."
3575,"They both have great redeeming qualities that pretty much balance the scale. The gags are as intelligent as they are crude, and delivered with exquisite timing. The laughs are still there, and there are some genuinely funny moments. And the one female from the original who actually has a major role here, Alysson Hannigan as Michelle, also does a great job. The writing is way above par for movies in this genre, and the cast is both lovely to look at more than capable in their deliveries and actions."
5800,"If you can get your hands on it, watch it! So real, that it's hard to watch at times. Let's start with the positive aspects: The movie is very real, plain and simple shot to make its point. Katharina SchÃ¼ttler in her small role is as good as always. The effects of the voices are great if you own a Dolby surround receiver with 5."
3565,"Luckily, in his move to mainstream American filmmaking, Chan has been able to find behind - the - scenes talent good enough to match his own. Zhang Ziyi is a perfect complement to this couple. Carter is funny at being loud talking, and Lee is good at all his stunts. Like the previous film, this first of what will undoubtedly be a long line of lucrative sequels combines sardonic humor with eye - popping martial arts action sequences to entertaining effect. However, that is certainly a minor quibble about a film that, for the most part, provides plenty of laughs, some kick - ass performances and action sequences that, as per usual for a Chan film, will, quite literally, make your jaw drop."
3564,"A fun story - if entirely unoriginal - about an awkward and unpopular 15 year old San Francisco girl (Anne Hathaway) who discovers out of the blue that she is the heir to the throne of the small, fictional European principality of Genovia, and has to deal with all the adjustments that requires. You're doing a wonderful job and doing what you love and don't let anyone tell you different. Julie is an actress that could act well on any characters. This movie could have come off as cheezy but thanks to the director and skilled actors it proved to be a real treat. She didn't miss a beat in her portrayal of Queen Clarisse, and Hector Elizondo handled the role of Joseph - Mia's driver and bodyguard - with great style."
3563,"Ms. Jolie is definitely an attractive woman by conventional standards! The cinematography was absolutely stunning, the filming locations were impeccable for beautiful scenery and spots, and the graphic love scenes. With beautiful cinematography, wonderful costumery, the plot is rivalled only by Hitchock's Vertigo. As stated above, the sex scenes are among the best ever filmed. * out of **** Ah, the erotic thriller, a genre that now mostly exists in the form of straight - to - video or made - for - cable TV releases."
3585,This is definitely worth the 90 minutes it takes to watch it. It just has a twisted - wholesome 80s sense about it. This movie was so much better than a lot of other comedies. It adds amusing scenes with naive love. When watching movies late at night this one is a funny one to check out.
4033,"There are so many scenes that will hit home. It is one of the best performances of the decade. There are a ton of complex' steadicam' scenes. The film builds around this couple and the explosive crescendo that seems imminent from the opening scenes. Its succession of slick, fast - talking, emotional roller coaster scenes is a beautiful thing to watch."
3269,"Posey is fun and somehow manages to be daft but still effective in the role. Sure, it was campy, but it garnered genuine and consistent laughs from the audience. The three leads are all pretty good â€“ delivering the silly mood but also being in on the joke and into it. Josie and the Pussycats is lively and funny at points. The laughs are infectious while the sweetness - versus - evil plot is guaranteed to provide a venue to help you forget your worries and make you smile, smile, smile."
3529,"It has an excellent cast, including: Janeane Garofalo, David Hyde Pierce, Michael Showalter, Paul Rudd, Chris Melloni, Amy Poehler and Michael Ian Black. If you enjoy "" Monty Python "" style sketch humor or were a fan of "" The State "" (many of the players are employed here) or "" Kids in the Hall, "" then this is the ticket for you. This is also a must see for people who appreciate Janeane Garafalo's comic timing and Molly Shannon's bizarre brand of humor. Fans of the State, the most brilliant sketch comedy show of the past 187 years, will go absolutely crazy over this. A goofy, nostalgic spoof of the early 80's."
3355,"The technical aspects are very well done indeed, and the music is good. Kids will love it, adults might. Laurence Guterman does well directing, better than he did in the dreadful Son of the Mask four years later. Cats and Dogs is more than puppets meet Muppets; it is more than that, even though just as entertaining, it has progressed to greater levels. With an intelligent and comical script, good sets and capable staff, such as Tobey Maguire, Alec Baldwin, Jon Lovitz, Michael Clark Duncan, Susan Sarandon and the great cinema legend Charlton Heston in the limelight, some very good special effects and plenty of spills and action, you really cannot go wrong."
3261,"Luckily, the copious laughs made up for the extreme crudeness. Better yet, one of the most disgusting moments in the history of motion pictures. "" Tomcats "" is not the best of the gross - out comedies, but it delivers. If you liked Porky's, Revenge of the Nerds and the Naked Gun, you'll love this. Great simple love storyline, Classic dirty sick humour For fans of Teen Comedy movies such as Not another Teen Movie and Theres Something About Mary."
3356,"Luc Besson's screenplay isn't exactly creative, but given the genre, it's pretty darn good. As Jessica and Liu go up against cunning and ruthless adversaries, Liu makes a promise to Jessica that could compromise his career, even his life. But despite its few formulaic shortcomings, Kiss of the Dragon still delivers. The use of no wires is also a very nice touch. At times the dialogue is a bit heavy and there are a few moments where the film is a bit talky for a bit long without any of it coming to a great deal but mostly it is pretty enjoyable."
4040,"Maybe so, but it's Audiard's vision that makes the picture interesting. He uses a lot of tight close - ups, dark lighting, and fast cuts between scenes that are as rapid and unceremonious as BenoÃ®t Jacquot's in the 1998 ` School of Flesh' (` L'Ã‰cole de la Chair'). In French with easy to read subtitles and good translation. It is pleasing to note that the usual thriller plot contrivances are kept to a minimum here, and the surprises really are surprises. Jacques Audiard has crafted a unique character - driven crime movie with a fresh visual style and a compulsively watchable story."
3526,"( In this respect the apes are very human indeed). The original Planet of the Apes was a product of its time. , and the apes are indeed, in some respects, better than man. The make - up of the apes is magnificent, and the sets and backgrounds are beautiful too. In fact, compared to Mars Attacks, this is a serious movie."
3324,"Happy Madison productions has done it again. This was just plain funny and very entertaining throughout the goofy 83 minutes. Everything about the animals is hilarious too. With all the animal parts in his body Marvin gets very energized and leaves all his weakness behind, which them leads him to become a cop and a famous one at that. Rob Schneider is absolutely one of the best comedians out there."
4047,"The script, word for word, and moment for moment, is as perfectly judged as one of Martha's dishes. Director / writer Sandra Nettelbeck deserves praise for bringing this joyous piece to the screen. As in similar movies, just after the mid-point, when characters are well developed and things go nicely, conflicts occur. Obviously, she can cook, judging by the full houses and the good vibes she generates among the diners. Lina comes to the restaurant kitchen in the evenings, becoming a darling there, while Mario becomes a family friend and Lina's buddy, and the three look just like a family."
3613,"They welcome their new guests into a world of wealth, glamour, and fun. The characters are reasonably well - written, none of them come off as one - dimensional stereotypes, even though some of them, in all honesty, more or less are. Stellan's character was completely chilling, and he played it so effectively. THE GLASS HOUSE / (2001) *** (out of four) By Blake French: "" The Glass House "" takes place in a beautiful, luxurious glass mansion complete with swimming pools, expensive artwork, high - tech security systems, and just about everything else. The performances are part of what is effective with this movie."
3392,"It works well, especially if you like Asian movies. The characters were distinct, like - able, and voiced very well (even if the digital mouths don't quite match up most of the time). For a movie based on a video game, Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within was very good. It cuts corners on film - making, but its uniqueness makes up for it. The detail level of vehicles and scenery is superb, you can even see dust falling as the light streams in a window, this gives you an idea of how detailed it can be."
3639,"But Brautigan clearly has a special quality about him: he can sense things and see things that are not readily apparent to most others. He looks like the young Elijah Wood, with the same angelic blue eyes, and he's truly captivating. The kids - Anton Yelchin and Mika Bororem - are good, especially Yelchin, who has a far bigger role. So let's all rent / buy this wonderful film, and boost that IMDb score. Hopkins is great as usual, as is the boy, Anton Yelchin and the latter has a great career ahead of him."
3357,"Definitely a movie to watch if you want some good amusing immature fun with over the top acting and great gags. It's just a good rated R movie with spoofs for all tastes; of course, if you are not easily offended. So for those who are into sex jokes and scatological humor, you will be amused. This Scary Movie took on the films like The Exorcist (hilarious scene by the way), Poltergeist, The Haunting, Mission Impossible, Charlie's Angels, and What lies beneath. Tori Spelling, yeah, she's a bit scary, but for some reason she still gets her equal share of laughs."
4052,"This film is just the third work of the director, Ryosuke Hashiguchi, who continues to shoot marvelous films, which, certainly, have something to do with homosexuality quite casually, and most importantly, quite naturally. "" Hush "" is a dramedy out of Japan which swirls around a handful of young adults including a couple of gay men and a female who wants to have a baby by one of them. Nice performances and a nice soothing sound track (with just a little Japanese twist). THere are some really sweet scenes between the two main characters, and showing how they know each other well. Hashiguchi's film is also touching as he explores the many road blocks encountered in contemporary society by a lonely gay couple wishing to start a family (child adoption is not an option)."
3805,"But the sun really does shine, and quite a lot of the time, in all four - alright, three - and - one - half - seasons. "" Phonce "" is brilliantly played by Andy Jones. Great Acting, Direction, Casting, Plot, Script, and Cinemetography. He does a kind of "" loaves and fishes "" miracle with the material at hand, making a near - banquet out of a box - lunch. Small stories weave together with comfortable twists and turns while the rugged Newfoundland coast is always pounding away in the background."
4053,"These two climaxes occur so close together that maximum impact is definitely achieved. It's also one of those typically French films where everyone is beautiful and the drama proceeds by the subtlest of inflexion. This isn't a criticism; the same could be said of some of Bergman's great films. But, likes some of Bergman's films, its intensity can be overwhelming. with special kudos to Michael Bouquet and Charles Berling, the leads."
3395,"All characters involved are made believable and they all have their contribution to the story and none are lost within the film, and therefore, they all manage to stand out from the others. Brad Renfro is top - notch in all his performances, here is no exception. No question that these teenagers get what comes to them in the end, and the build - up to that moment is quite intense. Some of the best insights are in the portrayals of the parents. Very real and compelling portrayal of a murder involving a group of teens growing up in suburban Florida."
4064,"Smart script and excellent thriller overall. Zoe Saldana is gorgeous as always and a very good actress. In fact, in comparison with most rap - movies (ex: anything by Master P, or Dame Dash) this is Oscar worthy (in comparison, of course). Rap and hip - hop provide more than background music, they're central to the theme. From begining to end, this cause - and - effect thriller will hold you onto the edge of your seat and let go of you with a sharp blast to the frontal head."
5696,"At one point, the suicides evolve from their initial spirit of a unifying pact to a fad to be indiscriminately mimicked, whether one does it alone or not. It is significant that Sono shows many suicide victims with interlocked hands, achieving a kind of emotional / spiritual / "" kamic "" unity before taking the plunge. In terms of sheer spectacle, surrealism and the impact of its scenes, Suicide Club is simply an amazing, groundbreaking film. By the end you will wonder what the hell just happened, and you will be on the right road to understanding as long as you're willing to throw away the notion of an action - driven movie and allow the thematically constructed characters and powerful scenes to permeate your psyche and lead to reflection on the influences in teen's lives that give meaning to and strip meaning away from life. For example, in the late 20th / Early 21st Century, and especially in 2001, the year before Suicide Club was released, a big news story in Japan (and elsewhere, including BBC and CNN reports) was their relatively high suicide rate."
3306,"The special effects and battle scenes were great! Kenneth M. Taylor is a legendary hero of Pearl Harbor. Watch Jon Voigt recreate Peter Sellars' unforgettable character Dr. Strangelove. Waste of talent: Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Alec Baldwin, and Jennifer Garner are given relatively minor roles in the film. Each aircraft's handling qualities, e. g., speed, max altitude, rate of climb, rate of dive, turning, etc., are different."
3211,"The action scenes are very well done too. Herzfeld constructs "" Fifteen Minutes "" with complexity and thought. It has some excellent writing and some top - notch acting performances. In many respects, it suffers horribly from being predictable, although there were instances where it strayed sharply from the "" rules "" of formulaic movies. Robert De Niro gives another suave hotshot performance; it is coming to the point where his talent is more effective in shtick comedies like "" Analyzed This . """
3210,"But the film's brilliant craftsmanship wouldn't be nearly as effective without the power of the fine cast's performances, particularly Brooke Smith; her riveting performance makes Dawn the emotional center of SERIES 7: THE CONTENDERS. This sharp, smart, exhilarating thriller works on so many levels, and it's got one of the niftiest twist endings in ages, too! The champ is Dawn Lagarto (Brooke Smith of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS), a pregnant, troubled but essentially decent drifter. Trapped in the program for the past two seasons, Dawn's reluctantly willed herself into becoming a frighteningly efficient killing machine to keep herself and her unborn baby alive. Set in the near future, SERIES 7 is cleverly constructed as a marathon of seventh - season episodes of "" The Contenders, "" a hit reality show in which contestants are selected via state lotteries and given guns with which they're expected to hunt down and kill their fellow contestants (although they're free to use their own weapons and be inventive)."
4071,"The performances are as nuanced and natural as the direction. This quietly compelling entry from French director Claude Miller was strangely marketed to American international cinema enthusiasts as an edge of your seat thriller. "" Histoire "" means story and, as with the English word, implies all story's synonyms. Deftly, director Claude Miller and his excellent cast turn out a fairly fast - paced set of scenes of the lives of interconnected people faced with a crescendo of escalating trouble. Luck Mervil is new to acting and did a great job."
3305,"And the performances are absolutely incredible, particularly Nicole Kidman's. Visually it is superb, an indulgent feast for the eyes with every breathtaking, artistic scene. The music, the sets, the choreography - all of it is awe - inspiring. The cinematography (by Donald McAlpine) and art direction (by Ann - Marie Beauchamp and Ian Gracie) are brilliant, as well as the production design (by Catherine Martin) and the sets (by Brigitte Broch). The elegant sets, eventful style, and powerful choreography scream modern day, post-pop-culture."
4085,"This movie is amazing: just released on DVD in Brazil, it is certainly one of the best films of the year. Tense, powerful, having a wonderful screenplay and outstanding direction and performances, it is another great example of how the absolute power corrupts. Beibtreu is good once he gets past the stage where he is making trouble for the sake of it â€“ this is necessary to speed the descent into cruelty but it was laid on a bit thick at the start. It's amazing that good foreign films blow the socks off of most Hollywood garbage any day of the week. A journalist infiltrates in the team looking for a great matter."
5693,"Thoroughly entertaining, and suitable for all ages. With the Tadano High's summer festival coming very soon, every club from the school is preparing a special event on their own. They have a few disasters before actually getting to the synchro performance, you watch the friendships build and good things finally happening for the misfits. in fact, there are many funny moments standing out from a positive and upbeat background. To be able to make people laugh from one's belly and in so many continuous fractions of a minute is a gift."
5692,"It left no questions unanswered, and it concluded all the subtle hints that the earlier parts gave. And everything that they encounter throughout the film magically comes together in the end, and it's truly heartwarming. Jeon Ji - Hyun's acting in the film was very superior. It was the Best Asian Film at the 22nd Annual Hong Kong Film Awards. Jeon Ji - Hyun's acting versatility added to the second half's strong impact on the viewers."
3342,"The voice - overs were also great. This is a positive , 10 out of 10 review, from someone who was blown away by this film. Numerous other characters appear, take up the few minutes of screentime, then disappear. Infact the visual presentation of the film as a whole owes a lot to anime, much more so than any previous Disney outing. It is written in stone that Disney animations simply ~ must ~ be musicals."
4089,"Herzog is going for a more realistic response to the complexities of what is going on around him. While parts of the picture are heavy - handed and obvious, it has a refreshing, unsentimental neutrality about it's subject matter, and it's mise - en - scene pleasures are many. These are powerful scenes in a movie that could've been even more powerful. Invincible could use a major reworking. A worthy film in the Herzog repertoire and interesting enough even for non-enthusiasts."
3593,""" OK, "" She continues, "" and a person who speaks 2 languages? "" She zings a question: "" What do you call a person who speaks several languages? "" The acting was just perfect from everyone. Ang Lee's characters just seemed more genuine, the food more mouthwatering, & the story more believable. The rest of the actors are perfect choices, and make each of the characters they play another part of this charming film."
4091,"The sounds perfectly match the on screen actions and objects. Kamaji can be seen as a scary, daunting figure at the beginning, but soon he seamlessly changes into a humble, wise figure. ' Spirited Away's imperfect, but detailed world is far more fascinating than the perfected blandest of Disney's latest offerings. It has been another inspiring movie from Haiyo Miazaki that is above all his best yet. His thunderous action music hits the viewers on the chest like a hammer."
5684,"All the actos put in superb performances, transporting the viewer back to those troubled times. Ferch's performance as the swimming champion and former prisoner Harry Melchoir is outstanding. Despite working, no doubt, under the same constraints as his opposite numbers, he shows as much determination as any of the other diggers, and perhaps even more courage. There were others that contributed to making Roland Suso Richter's film the superlative treat that it was. What makes The Tunnel such compelling viewing is not it's high production values and suspenseful story, although it has both in oodles, but the very fact that it is a true story."
3209,"Therefore, do See Spot and share it with others. But, all in all, this movie will result in some big smiles for its viewers. The California setting, the costumes, the camera work, and the lively script / direction add up to fun. There are lots of laughs and lots of woofs. This was a very pleasant surprise; a very good comedy filled with a lot of laughs and - more surprise - not much raunch and profanity."
5683,"Thank you for a wonderful 2 hrs and 9 mins. The baseball scenes are quite realistic. In Barry Pepper, who plays Roger Maris, and Thomas Jane, as Mickey Mantle, Crystal found two actors absolutely perfect for their respective roles. The middle infield combination of Bobby Richardson and Tony Kubek seemed to be turning double - plays on an almost alarming routine basis, becoming the best at what they did. Mantle even moved in with Maris during the season."
5680,"Stemming from this, it's easy to see that the performances are quite good. The sets are excellent, the locations are splendid, and the whole' feel' of the movie is very realistic. Under the guises of the subtexts, as well as on a more visceral surface level, the film is a great success. It builds on the shocks and twists and is very smart and sees the story from many perspectives. All the cast give good performances and Thora Birch is outstanding."
5686,"This is a chilling dramatisation of the meeting that sealed the fate of millions of Jews. This excellent co-production by HBO and BBC is based on real - life deeds and previously shot in i984 a German film by Heinz Schirk. The Jews capable of work will be brought these areas for road building, in which task undoubtedly a large number will fall through natural diminution. There are a number of moments of exceptional power in the movie - one is where Kritzinger realises the truth, another is where Heidrich makes it clear to Shtukhard that he will be victimised if he does not cooperate. Adding more details along with the well developed on the movie, the deeds were happened of the following manner: The meeting took place in the Berlin suburb of Grossen - Wannsee, where the decision was made to adopt the Final Solution, the contemplated extermination of Jews."
3525,"The costumes are amazing and the sets rock. It is an inspired performance, with riveting songs. The film's musical numbers are brilliantly crafted and cross several different genres. The amazing acting, outrageous costumes, and fabulous wigs make it a cult classic. Equal parts musical, mockumentary, and drama, the film pleases on all levels."
3608,"He's one of the best to pop up in the last few years. This is a great little film about consequences. It's one of the best films of the 21st century. The performances are remarkably natural and extraordinary, the cinematography is top - notch, the script is both hilarious and heartbreaking, and the whole film has such a strong sense of intensity and ferocity that it's really difficult to stop watching it once you start. This film explores the soft underbelly of middle class Long Island, as well as the consequences that are borne as a result."
5340,"There are two kinds of people who will enjoy' Musa'. Like Zhang Yimou's SHANGHAI TRIAD, practically every frame is beautifully composed and rendered, and could easily hang on a gallery wall somewhere. The production design is incredible, the locations stunning, the special effects groundbreaking (the gore). Sound effects in the battles are excellent. They made good use of that figure, with sometimes disturbing, but very well done fight scenes and in general, beautiful cinematography."
4601,"Chiyoko is amazing at any age or time; her determination, spirit, and energy are infectiously admirable. The movie seamlessly integrates dramatic moments, with light humor and stunning visuals. This one asks questions, has fun moments, and really touching ones. The fusion of reality and fiction is truly remarkable, and Satoshi Kon distinguishes himself from conventional dogmas in that aspect. Some of these flashbacks at least in their thematic references recur more than once, and variations between them become clever plot devices that lend meaningful depth of time and space to the film."
3643,"A good time, take the kids. Solid kid performances and lots of fun moments definitely make this one worth taking the kids to. Amusing for adults, a blast and a half for pre-puberty members of the family, Max Keeble is just good junior high fun. This movie had a lot of laughs for a younger audience, and was entertaining. In fact, the movie deals wisely with a lot of values: friendship, parenthood, school finances."
5320,"Thankfully it is available on DVD. It's a breath of fresh air because it makes some strong statements about morality and forgiveness, and is written beautifully. also filled with philosophical questions and ruminations). This should be a "" must see "" in school history classes. The film begins rather slowly (and overly - sentimental) but becomes an incredible story with great acting and characters, powerful philosophy and imagery."
3524,"The overall production is excellent (the brightness and colors in the photography, costumes and sets is stunning). But thats a mark of a good movie. Movies like this are seldom and Hollywood tends to make it's films unnecessarily spectacular these days. Thora Birch gives her most confident performance to date, and Scarlett Johansson is superbly laconic as Enid's icy side - kick. But the people who have remained true to their values (like Steve Buscemi's Seymour, in a performance that should have been at least nominated for an Academy Award), are portrayed as leading equally vacuous lives."
5232,"The beauty of the locations is just breathless (at several thousands miles of altitude! ) Recognized as a Khenpo (a title of tibetan scholastic mastery), some further and higher Initiation will be bestowed on him by the Highest Rimpocheh nearby. There are some passages of the film that just tastes like a short documentary. Very rarely one can find such a well balanced movie with a full commitment from the whole staff: Director (Nalin Pan), all the Actors & the total Crew. , soul - stirring landscapes and above all masterly written and directed by Pan Nalin - whoever he maybe."
6049,"It was definitely really sweet to see those scenes. Thumbs UP and four solid stars! But the most interesting were the dialogs. Norman Jewison directed, & he always gets the best out of him performers. Quaid and Kinnear were excellent listeners and responded to each other in the same way as Page."
3304,"Mike Myers is witty and brilliant as the voice of Shrek. But that's not the core of the story - the core of this story is the friendship between Shrek and Donkey, which works in a funny goofball, but touching and unique way. Eddie Murphy being employed as a wisecracking donkey was a casting dream and plays well against the more plain Shrek, voiced by Mike Myers. You name it, it gets an affectionate pie in the face at some point in "" Shrek "". The amazing cast of Shrek, including Eddie Murphy and Mike Myers does a great job of living up to their comedic expectations."
4118,"It has some really sweet and touching moments since it is the introduction of the lovable, fresh Pokemon Celebi. As in the preceding three Pokemon movies, the story centers on the loveable' Pikachu'. A young boy tries to save the pokemon and it takes him somewhere. The original gang consisting of Ash, Pikachu, Misty and Brock travel to a forest were legendary PokÃ©mon are said to exist. The animation was beautiful, although there were a couple parts that did not look good."
3587,"Mewes was f-ing hilarious, when he f-ing say the f-ing f - word every f-ing word. As the Bluntman and Chronic movies premieres, someone says, ` Well, it was better than Mallrats. This is mostly down to a fantastic supporting cast of some great comedic performers. There were many pot - shots of American movies. This guy is for real, by far and away he has put in the best performance of all his five film appearances as "" Jay "" He carries the picture and is side splittingly funny."
3208,"The performances keep the romance alive; clearly Pitt and Roberts are the right choices for the parts. It's a movie that never pretends to be anything other than what it is, which is pure entertainment. To create a film and feature two of Hollywood's biggest stars was a good idea. The characters are well drawn and the dialogue is clever and witty (` You â€˜ Forrest Gumped' your way through this .' ) Pitt and Roberts were a good match, and James Gandolfini really was the best part of this movie."
4986,"This is a perfect example of the greatness of DVDs. Definitely one of the best WW - II movies or series out there. These representatives of "" The Greatest Generation "" did themselves and this nation proud. Spielberg and Hanks really did a great job on this miniseries! Also of special interest is David Schwimmer as Capt. Herbert Sobel."
4122,", it's very funny and it features Samuel L. Jackson in a kilt. Energetically directed by Yu, with flamboyant performances by Carlyle, Ifans et al. 51st State is difficult not to enjoy. This movie is pure entertainment and has some very, very funny moments. It manages to stay quirky enough to keep entertaining and you shouldn't feel as if you completely wasted the last 92 minutes of your life. In fact in some places it `s like a live action cartoon, but the greatest problem is the cast going completely over the top."
4995,"Jonathan M. Woodward delivers a powerful performance as another hospital worker more interesting in numbers than people. There is plenty of irony, wry humor, and understated insight; and yet the film, stark as it is, is abundantly human and, in places, even sweet. This film is a veritable showcase for the incredible talent of Emma Thompson, who gives a performance that is so remarkable there are not enough superlatives to do it justice. As Vivian Bearing, Thompson is absolutely mesmerizing--you simply cannot take your eyes off of her for even a moment. It also comprises a tour - de-force performance by Emma Thompson, an actor whose performances are almost always extraordinary--so the fact that this one stands out says a lot."
3838,"The editing is nigh on perfect throughout the film. Wonderfully funny, awe - inspiring feature on the pioneers of turntablism. An immensely enjoyable soundtrack as well and not just talking heads, but lots of music, old school footage, parties, break dancing, you name it. It covers almost all the important aspects of the only element of hip - hop which has been there from the very start. The sound editing is also very good, with some nice sweeping sounds being used to help with transitions."
4125,"David Arquette proves himself to be not merely the idiot bastard son of the Arquette family with a powerful performance; Harvey Kietel and Steve Buscemi are brilliant as always. No punches pulled in this one. Good cast with Harvey Keitel, Mira Sorvino, Steve Buscemi and an impressive performance for a change by David Arquette. The acting work of David Arquette, Harry Keitel and Steve Buscemi is excellent. In conclusion, the play / film contains dialogue and scenes that are memorable."
3605,"Everything from acting to cinematography was solid. He captures the scenes with an intense urgency, and a raw, unmistakable energy. Jennifer Aniston had a great supporting role, and looked lovely as ever. The performances were great, as was the music, and the main characters were likeable. A lot of the early scenes were funny and entertaining."
3812,"The scenes are quick and engaging. The cinematography very much captures Pa., as well as the sets. Hilarious and disturbing Scotland, Pa. is a joy! You can set them in the 18th century or a hundred years in the future and the characters are still real and powerful. The direction, acting, locations and deadly earnest commitment to the lunacy make it an entertaining movie for anyone to watch."
3204,"As is true with many things in life, Nelson goes from one extreme to the other. Keanu does a good performance with Nelson, creating a believable image of a single focused Ad Executive. San Francisco is an interesting backdrop - the positive aspects of it are emphasized, and it becomes another character in the film. Charlize Theron and Keanu Reeves look good together; Keanu is not playing a superficial action role, so the focus is not on him. There's a good deal of loose ends in this story that were either not clearly explained or not explained at all."
5071,", Nancy Sterngood (Charlotte Stewart), Miguel (Tony Genaro), Melvin Plug (Robert Jayne) and, of course, good old Burt, loaded to the nines with firepower. There's loads of energy and self - referential humor and the locations have a more dark / sophisticated look to them than in the previous 2 films. It's clear the film - makers were having a lot of fun with their story & one can well see that they had their heart set in the right place. The effects were just as good, it had two major characters returning, and the script was a lot of fun and had a few suprises. The movie isn't anything great, but it's got some cool stuff in it."
3262,"In fact, it succeeds almost on the strength of its performances alone. some of the roles were prettied up for Hollywoodland, Marta was more tragic and mute than she needed to be, Jamie Lee far too soignee and elegant. The writer here moved into new territory for him, a maturity reflecting an understanding of his own limits. Actually, Osnard is James Bond minus loyalty and with his self - confidence, decadence and sexism turned up a couple of notches. It is a treat for those who love international political intrigue and who may have traveled or lived in such places."
3799,"Todd Solondz just happens to be vastly more perceptive and talented than most. Here, many facets are explored, the characters are complex, the drama intricate - and the tension builds, right below the drab suburban surface. The Paul Giamatti character was a hilarious reflection of Solondz himself. The second story, "" Non-fiction "", is clearly stronger, and told with much more passion from the writer / director. A controversial, worthy, and very entertaining film that stretches your ability to make moral judgements within a convincingly coherent framework."
4590,"However, it was kind of neat to "" meet "" some of the key players and hear them personally give their observations and viewpoints. The majority of people have moved on from the desktop to the tablets and mobile phones. This documentary is a very concise but excellent guide for the uninitiated into a world usually the arcane preserve of specialists most adept at talking to each other. Several of those interviewed pursue their open source values almost as a creed, the commitment to computers taking the place of more traditional dogma. Anyone interested in a major intellectual counterpoint to the dominance of both Microsoft and the role of law in insuring proprietary benefits for innovators should see "" Revolution OS "": no manual required."
3203,"Rock is hilarious at times and so are some of the others. There are a number of guinely funny moments in "" Down to Earth . "" The best that Mr. Keyes can come up with is ruthless, white , 60 - year old tycoon Charles Wellington. Incredibly, Rock served double - duty as the film's executive producer and one of its four scribes. While he is slightly funnier here than in CB4, he isn't as good as he could've been."
3328,"For example, two couples are played by actors who are married to each other in real life (Kline and Cates, the Golds; and Hickey and Posey, the Adams). It is worth watching if you have followed the careers of these two. It embraced many universal points of conflict in relationships--be it with a spouse, a neighbor, a boss, a co-worker--and allowed you, as a viewer, to watch all of the varying (and often hilarious) perspectives. Rounding out the exceptional cast are Jane Adams (Clair), John Benjamin Hickey (Jerry), Parker Posey (Judy), Jennifer Beals (Gina), Matt Malloy (Sanford) and Owen Kline and Greta Kline (Kevin and Phoebe's real life children, as Jack and Evie Gold). egos, yet each presented within their own unique perspectives and contexts."
3202,"Jack Black and R. Lee Ermey are hilarious, as always. Amanda Peet was wickedly funny, and all three male stars were equally crass and deliciously low - down. 1 out of 10--half being for Detmer and the other half because it wasn't as bad as Here One Earth. Amanda Peet has a great resume of smaller films such as Body Shots, Playing By Heart, Whipped and She's The One. Jack Black and Steve Zahn are two of the best comedic actors in the business today."
3798,"Jasmine Trinca as the sister, like the others, is appealing and real. This witty moment sums up the films often sardonic style. What surprises is that Moretti's movie achieves real emotional authenticity precisely because if its light Italian touch. He appears to be a happy man, happily married and a father of two well behaved teenagers. And the sister, played by Jasmine Trinca, is also an endearing character."
5896,"The scenes which one finds to be most exciting are the scenes one finds to be the shortest. In the end, the zany characters and moments of excitement do not cut it and leave something lacking. Some of the situations and conversations are fairly amusing. The adventures of these guys are bound to entertain you even though, or more likely because they are adventures on a tragically small scale. The directors, Rebella and Stoll, made another film a few years later, Whisky, that it was more polished and mature, and dealt with the hopelessness not of the youth of Uruguay but of its middle aged people."
5145,"And, seeing the great Jean Stapleton (of Edith Bunker fame) utter the sentence "" You look like sh*t "" to Frank Whaley was priceless! It would be a fine date movie for 20 or 30 - somethings. eeks out marginal success with some fresh ideas and an easy buy - in owing to the averageness of the characters. Anabeth was great as the "" best friend "". the cast is so appealing that it's flaws don't really matter much."
3201,"Obviously, though SOTL focused mainly on Starling's character, Hannibal focuses on, well, Hannibal. It is beautifully filmed by a talented director and crew, and features lovely Italian location scenes which contrast with the grim plot. He was reduced from the center of a rich world in Manhunter to a human camera (). The Academy Award winning thriller earned ubiquitous critical acclaim, therefore a continuation is nearly incapable of living up to its standards. Hopkins was getting a bit old to play Hannibal, mid-60s by now, but to his credit he did handle himself remarkably well, and moved with the grace of a younger man."
3198,"This is the perfect blend of 80's and 90's horror. You get the style, cinematography, and good acting of 90's films and the stalking - slasher madness of an 80's flick. Lots of tense moments when he appears. While Valentine's Day is no masterpiece, it's a very good horror / thriller film that seems strongly prone to misconceptions. It isn't just some silly average horror movie, it's got class and a certain kind of edge that separates it from others made around this time."
3207,"The acting is good, Kevin Costner's bad guy is great, it's well filmed with a lot of excellent cinematography, combined with absolutely perfect use of the soundtrack from minor audio cues right through to the explosions. This film is funny (Jon Lovitz), sweet (David Kaye), and has more action than you could ever ask for in a heist film. Although it breaks little new ground in its already overworked genre, the film does emerge as an efficient crime drama thanks to a gallery of interesting characters, some impressive performances and Demian Lichtenstein's flashy directorial style. For action films this is great, a few slow parts, and the action scene at the end got a little predictable, with the high kill counts, but rebounds with a great ending. Stay at the end of this film for they have a bonus with the credits, an Elvis video and a funny out take from the film."
3196,"for one thing, it has quite a few laughs. there are some very witty scenes. The models: Shalom, Sara, Ivana, & Tomiko play it way over the top and it works. Monica Potter is adorable, Freddie Prinze Jr. is generically handsome and Head Over Heels at least makes consistent attempts at being funny. That must have been a proud day for the motion picture ratings board."
3206,"Then there's Downtown, which you must admit, looks good. It seems to be geared to get a reaction - every pore in the first forty minutes is explored for it surreal quality - creatures of another world abound. The cast was excellent with two bravura performances by Brendan Fraser and Chris Kattan. Mr. Fraser does an amazing job playing not only one but two roles of extreme eyeball pleasure. there are many images and icons from popular culture that are transposed here with great comedic and nightmarish effect."
3152,"Nice shots of Portugal, Holland, France etc, a great performance by Diaz and. Ecceleston, though a very good actor, his role seems to lack something. The performances are all good especially by Brewster and Diaz. Jordana Brewster is seen as the older Phoebe and makes a wonderful contribution to the film. Part of the narrative focuses on Pheobe's realization that her father was not a sainted, thwarted artist, but an ordinary man."
3151,"The scenes, in general, are handled in a sweet - natured fashion without becoming nauseatingly sentimental. Just watching the previews, you pretty much have a good idea what's going to happen in the end. True, "" The Wedding Planner "" does have its share of cinematic conceits. The characters are likable and charming, and you get quite engrossed in them. Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McCoughnahey are equally good and have a fine chemistry."
3150,"The point: cheese is good, though overindulgence could cause health problems. What worked: In a word: CUTE! Mena Suvari made a really good Kansas. Mena Suvari (late of both ` American Beauty' and ` American ` Pie') is a study in contrasts as the girl that ` was born in prison. Her partial sweet / tough looks, made her seem the perfect casting decision."
3268,"It's a fast - moving hour - and - a-half. It is consistently hilarious, has dozens of quoteable lines (stuff that you say to people in your daily routine) and has an overall feel good vibe to it. Which of course, leads to this movie's moral: Good things come to good people. It's a lot of laughs and fun for plebes at heart. He goes through life having all these setbacks - but he still maintains his positive outlook."
3267,"Her mannerisms, her weight, her enthusiasm and cutesy style are a wonder to behold. And there's a darling "" home movie "" sequence during the closing credits purporting to recall Bridget at four and Mark Darcy at eight, that retrospectively and adorably frames the movie. She's beautiful (as beautiful as RenÃ©e Zellweger has ever been on screen), honest and kind - hearted. Although set in England, the theme and feelings of single people everywhere were universal. The movie, like the book, has the most hilarious lines and moments, and each of the actors portrayed their characters so well you couldn't imagine anyone else in that part."
3144,"This is one the most unusually absorbing movies of the new year. The Pledge is a. good movie. Gone is the trademark uber - performance. The stark edge and superior direction give the movie an authentic feel and emotional vigor. This film's soundtrack contains enthralling, refreshing, and captivating instrumental tones."
3142,"Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas give real performances they do not come off as "" cardboard "" characters but as real human beings. It takes you to a place which actually exists and it takes real issues head on. The writing is cringe - worthy in many, many spots. IN A NUTSHELL: It's good to see a teen film that deals with more issues than just prom dates, and it will make you think, but it's not deep enough to be more than just a "" dance "" movie in the same vain as "" Centre Stage "" and "" Dirty Dancing "", culminating in long dance routine by Stiles, and when the routine is over, everything is resolved. The lower class Chicago area shows how dangerous things can be."
3265,"The sets, costumes and music all work perfectly. The wardrobes, makeup and hair styles appear authentic and impressive. The scenes with Pablo Escobar are especially amusing. The film moves seamlessly from George's adolescence to adulthood through a number of locations and vividly captures the essence of that decadent era. "" Blow "" is one of the best movies of the year."
3141,"A great buddy movie, with great performances and production values, thoroughly entertaining, and very, very, funny. Jones' performance in Replacements is proof positive of his talent. There are flaws, there are clichÃ©s and there is an extremely happy ending. It has humor, action, a little drama, and with all those emus. It also has some pretty decent action sequences and some quirky moments."
3140,"The server which Synapse is being distributed from seems to be very effective, taking millions of hits within hours. His uncanny Bill Gates like character will leave true computer geeks rolling in the aisles. Tim Robbins and Ryan Philippe both give good performances, and nobody seems out of place talking about technology. Good things aside, AntiTrust had its share of problems. It's fantastic to have a fantasy in which an evil Bill Gates actually gets whats coming to him."
3303,"An intense viewing of the film affords the viewer to appreciate the opening shots, the alley shots, and the corridor shots that evoke feelings. Though unevenly woven, the film has several sequences that show Mandoki has fine capabilities. Sharon's private and public lives are well developed and intriguing. Luis Mandoki has a certain knack with directing love stories that disclose their plot at the perfect moment. She's equally as good as he, but she conveys her different wounds in a different way."
3521,"Thankfully Part III is much, much better. Jurassic Park III had a spectacular sense of adventure. In his place is Spinosaurus, aka "" The one with the fin . "" The dinosaurs were better than ever and the more than competent cast, led by the always excellent Sam Neil, did a terrific job of bringing the various characters to life. *** SPOILERS *** 1) A plane crash usually causes a great deal of injury."
8653,"Unless he decides there's a project out there worthy of his talents The Last Brickmaker In America is the last time Sidney Poitier was seen on the big screen or small. Compared to the usual "" grind 'em out "" television long - form projects, there is a lot of texture and attention to detail: cast performances, production design, cinematography, and even if the casting and direction of the background players. A wonderful drama with great performances and serious subject matter. a thoughtfully written, performed, and photographed Movie of the Week, which took full advantage of rustic rural and suburban locations in and near Charlotte, NC. Ok, the story ain't the most rivetting, but it's nicely told without outrageous effects."
3619,"Burns, Dawson, Tucci, Murphy, Klumholtz, and Graham all have meaty roles here and each of their stories are well - presented and attention - grabbing. In doing so, Burns shows his brilliance for a balanced dissection, for he presents differing viewpoints in the course of the flick. Add on a nice NYC setting, some terrific costumes and some great production values and you have a fine looking film as well. A good film, refreshingly real, but without the big important moments (transformation, change, when characters learn something, etc.) it is ultimately forgettable. ` Sidewalks of New York' is one of the best films of the year!"
3264,""" Along Came a Spider "" was a wonderful book and the character of Gary Soneji was compared to a spider. To make sure you are getting your moneys worth, the writers have thrown in a ` Guaranteed Surprise Ending "". Probably the best acting is turned in by easy on the eye Ms. Potter. Mr. Wincott is also very, very good. ALONG CAME A SPIDER / (2001) ** (out of four) By Blake French: In 1997, a big year for serial killer movies, Gary Fleder's "" Kiss the Girls "" enriched the genre with a sense of splendid atmosphere, mystery and intrigue."
3618,"This performance is working on so many levels it's astonishing. So with what happens to him here, he gets one of the best comeuppances ever seen on the big screen. What a superb film, Denzel Washington at his superb best. Denzel Washington is a great example in this film of the arrogance of power. At the end of they day they're "" Just people and they always were "" (Ethan Hawk in a making of Traning day interview)."
7840,"A nice touch on the DVDs is that when a piece of music is playing then pressing the "" info "" button on the DVD or its handset, brings up a screen about the music being played, e. g. title of music, who wrote it, who is playing, when was it recorded, etc. . Louis Jordan is singled out in "" Jazz "" as someone who led black audiences awa y from jazz, yet his music developed directly from the swing music of the 30's and early 40's. Towards the end, especially when they begin to talk of the 50's and 60's, the whole program begins to have the taint of academia all over it. Once jazz had been firmly defined as an improvised music emphasizing certain kinds of instruments and instrumental combinations, there developed a tendency among jazz musicians to draw almost exclusively from earlier jazz styles, often the "" purer "" styles of recent vintage. Herbie Hancock, who is a pillar of Jazz and probably the most important Jazz - man of the last 30 years, was barely mentioned as a part of Miles Davis' group."
4228,"So though this is a low budget fantasy, everything is communicated efficiently. He's also breathtakingly prolific, having completed around twenty projects since this, which was released only three years ago (! ) Those three movies alone prove he is the most exciting and innovative director working today, but' Visitor Q' takes him to a whole new level. But, instead of falling into a dogma - like movie, Miike pushes the plot to its most unacceptable extremities, sometimes flirting with the fantastic genre. Takashi's version exaggerates the degree and manner in which this family is broken, but his stylistic exaggerations are uncomfortably acceptable."
3680,"It has some great performances, good direction, brilliant writing and will very likely keep you glued to the screen. As the events unfold with clever twists, it becomes an intense human drama and a thrilling experience for the audience. The riveting conversations that evolve from somewhat sneeringly nostalgic to downright inhospitable fluidly move the film more actively than any number of action - packed popcorn flicks out there. This movie is filled with layers just like it's characters (Ethan Hawk is incredibly funny b - t - w) and the ending adds a superb twist. While its only setting is inside a motel room, the written word by Stephen Belber transforms this into a thrilling drama about past lives and future consequences."
3655,"It's one of the year's most fun surprises. If you appreciate deeper levels of subtlety and are prepared to suspend hard - nosed reality for the duration, you will love this one. As aforementioned, Blanchett is perfect as the love interest. The movie is beautifully filmed in interesting places and there are even a few classy automobiles around. Well, Blanchett perfectly completes the trio of actors, and has a great chemistry with the 2 male leads."
3302,"com is still an interesting look at a brief but fascinating time in these peoples lives and proves enjoyable. The film is fitfully compelling, and Tom and Kaleil are interesting enough figures to make this story watchable. It is an uncompromising real life look, and it is up to the viewer to decipher; sometimes this works sometimes not. The most compelling part is the coorelation between their relationship eroding as does the company. The docu relies on the screen - filling charisma and intelligence of Kaleil Tuzman, CEO of the start - up company guarantees to drive the narrative."
3846,"The ending makes perfect sense in light of everything that's gone before. It certainly has moments that fit those adjectives, but then there are scenes of great power that really impress. The film is quiet, ponderous, and sensitive (so is the brilliant score by Tindersticks). In the other scenes of violence, Denis's wise discerning between the appropriate placement or absence of music asserts a very moving outcome. The two much talked about cannibalism scenes occur pretty late in the film and are worthy of the fuss - they are stunning."
3642,"To start off, the story in itself is very nicely written and manages to avoid clichÃ©s. An intense action / horror / thriller directed by John Dahl that stars Steve Zahn (Stuart Little 2, Sahara), Paul Walker (2 Fast 2 Furious, Into the Blue), and Leelee Sobieski (The Glass House, Eyes Wide Shut). The lovely Leelee Sobieski is perfect as Walker's head - strong girlfriend. Joy Ride is a helluva movie. But once Lewis and Fuller pick up Lewis' girlfriend (Leelee Sobieski), things start right up again with increased intensity, and the realization that this isn't just any trucker."
3299,"The cast is superior (observe Bettany's mastering of his craft), as they are believable and likable. After you get past the first one or two scenes, everything really grows on you. The makers of "" A Knight's Tale "" set out to entertain, and did so dutifully. Anyway, even though it's a bit long at 132 minutes, it's still entertaining most of the way, with some of the funniest bits at the beginning. The main characters are nicely varied with distinct personalities."
4249,"The DVD transfer is sharp, too, and has good sound. He belongs to a new bred of creators with a sharp eye for detail and cinematic style. Leonardo Sbaraglia is Argentina's gift to Spain. As the case goes though, if you are on the ride and you accept the risks taken - you will enjoy this film very much so. Max Von Sydow brings his royal presence as Samuel, the master player of the game that pits him against all the others that dare come close to him."
3604,"There are certainly some good fights going on in this picture. The movie had incredible stunts and great fights. The fight scenes are very well done, and the pacing keeps the viewer interested. He then grows up and trains himself to be the best fighter, to become a hero and stop what happened to his parents from happening again. The opening swordfight in the resturaunt is the best in the movie."
3640,"But it's incredibly funny, especially the DVD. Out of all the Stiller / Wilson collaborations this is definitely the funniest. The movie does no less and as a result, has received some very negative patron reviews. Directed by and starring Ben Stiller, Zoolander is a very funny movie, if you know what to expect. Jerry Stiller, like Wilson, always manages to find humor in every role he plays, and in Zoolander this remains especially true."
3280,"He did a good job as Ardeth. His screen appeal rivals Macauley Culkin at his best. Oded Fehr is wonderful as Ardeth Bay. Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, and Arnold Vosloo were very well chosen for their roles. The pymies were so amazing, and the Anubis warriors were excellent as well."
3638,"But all this is skillfully handled, with just enough tweaks to the familiar formulas to make it feel fresh. Though Brittany Murphy is a standout, the story is over-the-top - and when you can see everything coming, it's as suspenseful as watching paint dry. The DVD extras are among the best, if you enjoy aspects of film - making. Famke Janssen is good as his wife. The whole movie pretty well follows typical Hollywood thriller formulas, but it is pretty entertaining anyway, especially since the story is told in a way that you don't really know what is going on until the very end."
3875,"This was a rare film in the romantic comedy genre which didn't follow the tired old formulas. The first few minutes of "" Kissing Jessica Stein "" are pretty routine. Tovah Feldshuh was brilliant and touching as the Jewish mother with a true understanding of her daughter. In fact, New York itself was a character in this film, providing both opportunities and barriers to the relationships among the characters. Yet it still has a classic feel to it (great music and a beautiful aesthetic)."
3876,"All these films have a real breath of fresh air that is palpable. This is an amazing film by Lieven Debrauwer. It was extremely well acted, especially by Dora van der Groen as Pauline. The colors of the sets are interesting in conjunction with the character development. Both of the protagonists' roles, played by Dora van der Groen and the now deceased Ann Petersen, are impressive."
3877,"With hopes, with wishes, with thoughts. Some of them were so articulate and insightful than many of the adults, such as the president. To say that this film is a must see is an understatement; it should be mandatory for all Palestinians and Jews to see it together. One of the best documentaries of the year and one that is a good one to give you an explanatory introduction to the conflict. Goldberg astonishingly brings the Israeli twins Yarko and Daniel to spend a day with their Palestinian neighbor Faraj."
4270,"The entire cast lends excellent support, with many outstanding scenes, and no disappointments. Supporting castes are excellent, with a special mention of Danny denzongpa, who acts his part to perfection. Well, Whatever :""Asoka""is a very beautiful film, with a great cinematography, scenarios and clothes. the emotional parts are fantastic with poetic cinematography. This film should be given its due in that its better than most Indian movies of the day - way better."
3644,"and perfectly cast with John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale. And the fact that Cusack makes Jonathan so believable, and someone with whom you can identify, has more than a lot to do with it. And that's the magic of the movies. If you like good chemistry between the likeable Cusack and Beckinsale in a magical setting. Cusack is so likable, and manages to convey the bedevilment of his situation with such facility, that the viewer is unequivocally drawn in from the beginning."
3327,"And the set - pieces are also very impressive, if slightly over the top. And that fashion is highly cinematic, with all sorts of post-matrix still pans and small object tracking. The action scenes are good, sometimes very exciting. There are enough special effects and stunts intermixed with a fairly compelling narrative (it is not confusing if you just pay attention) to make the film more than worthwhile. This was a decent action movie with a strong cast with the likes of John Travolta, Don Cheadle, Halle Berry, and Hugh Jackman."
3825,"These guys really know how to make you laugh your ass off, and the fact that they manage to keep the straightest faces imaginable while doing it is priceless. Super Troopers combines solid physical comedy with surprisingly solid comedy writing. The outtakes and behind the scenes features are probably fantastic! Regardless, there is nothing wrong with the plot and if you appreciate / comprehend the jokes the movie flows just fine. There are great performances from all of the characters including the stoners, cops, and troopers."
3279,"' The difference is that although the studio has sliced and diced this, there are still some funny bits. What went on behind the scenes was funny & screwball in itself, and most of all, it was not even scripted at all. Beatty's timing is great: he has the ability to coordinate his movements with his comic reactions. But there are some signs here of a potentially successful project. Very appealing segments like the exuberant Kinski announcing her pregnancy."
4569,"Great performances here in this blend of comedy and high flying soccer action. Shoalin Soccer is the perfect movie for that purpose. In the little "" relief "" spots it's as dramatic as it's supposed to be, and the rest, it's big, big, BIG laughs all the way. That's right, it gets a million billion stars. The special effects are great, all the performances are great, and the movie doesn't take itself at all seriously."
3396,"There is great chemistry between Adebimpe and Verbeke. While the beginning and end stick pretty closely to the conventions of the genre, the events in between manage to take some very interesting turns. From the opening scenes it was apparent that this film had a nicely comic tone to it that was amusing. Similarly the film feels very episodic â€“ the scenes don't flow into each other but feel more like they are very distinct and separate events. This is one of many amusing scenes that deal with the theme of language differences."
3397,"Ricky is Vince Vaughn's character, and he's like a force of nature. Definitely go seee it - a great follow up to Swingers. Jon Favreau's' proper' follow - up to 96's' Swingers' see's him as part of a double - act with Vince Vaughn. Still, Vaughn, Combs, and Love provide enough good moments that the picture is worth checking out at least once. The dialogue and chemistry between Favreau and Vaughn, though, is still at it's comedic best."
3657,"Transferring this to' Mulholland Dr.' it means innocence is one of the most important conditions to watch and appreciate it. All these elements are richly at work in' Mulholland Drive ,' making for a riveting, hair - raising, and highly satisfying film experience â€“ especially if one does not become overly obsessed with trying to make all the plot pieces fit into a logical, mystery - unraveling whole. In short, "" Mulholland Dr. "" is a brilliant piece of film - making and it is brilliant due to its unique aspects and the fact that it is what one thinks it is. It's also worth noting, for viewers who'll primarily be interested in it or who enjoy it just as much as other aspects, that Mulholland Drive has a quite steamy lesbian scene. This may well have been the unacknowledged Best Picture of 2001 among major American releases."
3904,"She is unpredictable and that's one of her major instruments of self - assertion. In the much - discussed toilet scene, Haneke's camera brings you so close to the action that all you can do is squirm. Erika is a highly intelligent, perfectionistic, ambitious and driven woman, who has single - mindedly and relentlessly identified her whole self with her work and achievement. Bravo, Michael Haneke and Isabelle Huppert for a brilliant movie and an equally brilliant and tense performance! She promises to send him a letter of instruction for further pleasurable exchanges."
3658,"As the film wears on it plateaus and becomes somewhat muddled by unnecessary quirky characters and an side plot about Brook's past in an apparent attempt to jerk the last tear and keep feel good moments coming. Leelee Sobieski has another great performance in the role of a disturbed and rebellious teenager, needy of love and care, who changes her behavior when she meets her soul - mate friend in a middle - age man. LeeLee Sobieski is a real talent. Director Christine Lahti, who won an Oscar for best short film, "" Lieberman in Love, "" concentrates on the flowering friendship between a Goth girl who needs a friend and a job and a 49 year - old haberdasher who has jettisoned everyone in order to live out his life painlessly for everyone. Being accepted as you are and for who you are is the basis for all honest and lasting relationships."
3659,"Arquette gives a brilliant performance as does Cheedle and Stoltz. great performances, great speculative story, and excellent music and all around authentic feel. Outstanding performances, well written, everything comes together in a powerful yet disturbingly emotional manner. One of the favorites at the Sedona Film festival. Filled with wonderful performances (why isn't Kim Dickens a star yet? )"
3667,"But, as Hollywood standards go, it's better than average. All the performances are strong, fitting together into an ensemble piece, with Depp being as much a chameleon as ever as Abberline, and Robbie Coltrane equally strong as his colleague Godfrey. This produced a wonderful atmosphere, creating murder scenes that were much more terrifying and shocking (and very gruesome). Johnny Depp's performance (as the detective Abberline), as always, was hugely enjoyable to watch. OK, so Heather Graham was impossibly glamorous, but movies with big budgets need a little bit of star appeal."
3668,"The Last Castle is about honor to one's self and honor among soldiers, even if they are prisoners. The performances are splendid all around. A former film critic, Lurie has emerged in the last few years as a maker of old - fashioned "" good movies well made "". Robert Redford takes a character who is admittedly rather sketchily written and, through sheer force of his charisma and personality, turns him into someone quirky and specific. Redford gives a modest, self - effacing performance--he's so noble he's like visiting royalty; Gandolfini plays his Colonel like an offended child, affecting a soft but precise, lispy voice, giving the one - dimensional role some unexpected subtext."
4300,"Combined, the movie becomes an exuberant and hilarious revenge story with uncompromising edge, providing also a constant study of values in modern life. The interplay between Noemi and Mme. Vidal, also played earnestly by Catherine Frot, is one of the best combinations of wits in a film. The viewers will laugh at the right time, enjoy the humour but importantly at the same time, they will not miss the underlying irony of things. And Malika / Noemie (Rachida Brakni), a beautiful, extremely intelligent prostitute of Algerian descent. Actors Vincent Lindon and Catherine Frot are wonderful, as usual, but it's newcomer Rachida Brakni who is stunning from first to last."
3617,"Ms. Carey knew, or should have known. 35 : 1 frame are a dime a dozen. This kind of story has been done before, with such real - life examples as the Jacksons providing source material for one excellent miniseries of the theme. As she crosses the paths of more people, eventually said people twig to the fact that she can vocalise with the best of them. If only the movie had contained more cringe - worthy gems like those!"
5903,"The production values are very high, great acting, direction, cinematography, script, music, everything is top notch. The raw human emotions are amazing. On the whole, another brilliant Korean flick, of which there are many coming into mainstream cinemas in the UK now. while it is violent, confrontational, and decidedly dark, it bristles with underlying emotion and shows life without the rose coloured glasses. Yes, this is a love story of sorts and yes they do fall in love in a way that is debased and seemingly fated."
3669,"Steve Zahn is easily the high - point of this film. This will undoubtedly be Drew Barrymoe's greatest performances. No dreams whatever, all she lived was true life. Based on the life of Beverly Donoforio, and the book with the same title, this movie was phenomenal. Although it may take place in the 1960s - 80s, it's still very true to life, and understandable."
3905,"All this while laughing heartily at Tracy Morgan and Allen Payne, Debbie DeSouza, Erika Alexander, Kadeem Hardison, etc. . The characters are colorful, and how it starts w / one character's 30th, and ends a year later on her 31st, was very well - done, as it wrapped IT ALL UP VERY NICELY! It's a great movie to watch with friends and to watch on a Friday night. Pretty much 50% of Tracey Morgan's lines are good one - liners! This movie is absolutely hilarious and provides a in - dept view of the emotional and personal crisis that everyone experiences as they grow older."
3260,"Out of four stars, Spy Kids definitely scores a three. Floop is after a brain prototype that Gregorio created years ago. Daryl Sabara was so cute playing Juni and should go far as well. Surprisingly fun to watch, even for adults and worth a look. But his other human henchmen Minion (played dastardly well by Tony Shalhoub) has other plans."
4633,"The first half sets the scene beautifully, explaining what Lagaan is, introducing the characters and gradually pulling the audience into this period and place, literally taking the viewer into Champaner through cinematography which highlights the locales and sets which establish the standard of living. that of the officer Captain Russel (played by Paul Blackthorne) is notable. The setting in the Gujrati village and country was beautiful. The opening scenes are more congruent to joining a conversation midway, as from the moment you are thrust into 1893's India, you gain footing and a sense of atmosphere, feeling at ease as the camera pans across its setting for the movie, drifting into the journey that will hold your attention for the duration of the film. Some of the songs and dances were breathtaking and emotionally charged."
3670,"He is in an on - going lucid dream that takes him to odd, but fascinating encounters with people and places. Every time you see it again, the concepts saturate your nervous system with reinforcing patterns that will later "" echo "" in your dynamics in synergistic ways. See it from a seat that's within the first ten rows of the theater; immerse yourself. This movie can be enjoyed on many levels, and also a whole spectrum of interpretations can be drawn from it, watch it and see what it makes you feel. This film, if seen by someone who has DEEPLY considered the mysteries of life, will thoroughly delight."
3671,"And that's the magic of the movies. Life is comprised of infinite possibilities; some known, others a mystery and destined to remain so. This is a unique individual, and Spacey brings him to life with care and the ability to share those moments that are particularly revealing, which adds to the believability of the character and the credibility of the story itself. There are moments which are extremely funny, parts that remind of a true thriller and others which reminds of high - class drama. Bridges makes an excellent doctor (you * want * to tell him what's on your mind) and Spacey's expressions and gestures are perfect in the role."
3672,It has an innocent quality that is not found in many films anymore. On The Line is a sweet and innocent movie for little girls or those who love cute little romances. Fans of light - hearted romantic films would be savvy to seek out this little sleeper. It actually had a decent story line and great supporting actors in it! No foul language whatsoever and it is soooo rare to find a PG movie that isn't targeting young kids / families (for those sensitive to this or can appreciate this element).
3673,"Jump cuts and abrupt scene changes only carry so far. No glasses or special optical device handed out at the theater this time. It is a complete retelling of the story with great action, special fx, acting and a few laughs thrown in as well as some references to the original. He was the master of gimmicks and chills in his day. This was very nearly an excellent film with a solid cast and very good effects."
3674,"Finally, the performances in this film are exquisite. This is, in part, due to the impeccable performances by each and every member of the cast. Somehow this pastiche works, largely on the strength of good performances. The talent in this film is top notch and even Gyllenhall is just amazing. Regardless of anything, sincere thought and expression went in to the making of Donnie Darko."
3913,"A few minutes in, a funny things started to happen. Cattaneo has but together a superb supporting cast especially in Tim Spall and Christopher Plummer who both do superb turns. Some good acting (espcially by Timothy Spall) leads this film well on it's way to the thumbs up. Although a bit slow at times, patient viewers will find themselves rewarded. It was probably made to capitalize on the well - deserved success of the "" Full Monty "": both films have a lot in common; proles / prisoners setting a show up."
6922,"This impressive documentary covers most of Stanley Kubrick's work, through the recollections of major figures in the film industry that, somehow, came into contact with this legendary director. Hearing Allen's first impressions of 2001 is refreshing (he didn't like it at first), whilst Scorsese's reaction to Paths of Glory is a perfect tribute to that picture's power ("" It was so honest, it was shocking! "" ) But remembering him through his work and the people who appeared in his movies is the most appropriate way to make a chronicle of his eventful life. Directors like Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Alex Cox, and Woody Allen all share their impressions of Kubrick's cinematic mastery; while actors like Malcolm McDowell, Sir Peter Ustinov, Jack Nicholson, and Matthew Modine share their impressions of working so closely with the man. Beginning with LOLITA in 1962, and continuing right up to the last film, EYES WIDE SHUT, in 1999, Kubrick chose material and subject matter that most other directors would never have thought of touching with a barge pole."
3919,"Technically, it's well done and it has some scenes that will have you at the edge of your seats. The acting in this movie is great but if there is any drawback it is that some parts are very powerful and may disturb some people. A couple of plot twists and an eerie finale makes for your moneys worth. It's a solid story with some great twists at the end, several of them, all believable, all fun, and best of all, obscured well enough to make them true twists. This is a very dark and intriguing horror type thriller based on the idea of religious murders."
3675,"And it's one of the subtle perspectives that makes this film so effective. Their vulnerabilities are in the open and they deal with each other as best they can. You Will Truly be left with a feeling of Supreme satisfaction and Dazzlement at how the film played out before your eyes. California Cinematic Dreamin' aside, the people here are real. Thomas does a good job of indicating the complexities of her character, dipping beneath the surface to make what could have been a one - note character alive and interesting."
3346,"All the things that are possible to comment objectively on (if anything ever is) are handled expertly. Jude Law is excellent, and so to is Frances O'Conner. Absolutely perfect acting by all players. Part one, as one reviewer noted, feels like a cross between E. T. and The Shining, an odd, but very effective combination. One of the greatest movies of all time."
3676,"The support is very good â€“ Badalucco, Shalhoub, Polito are all very good. Fortunately these' faces' they collected can also act, everyone does incredibly well here. McDormand is good and Gandolfini gets another good role and does well. it has some very interesting twists, and it holds your interest and entertains you for the entire run - time of about 1 hour and 45 minutes. "" The Man That Wasn't There "" is best viewed as a wicked cinematic joke, and in that regard, it succeeds, in (Sam) spades."
4642,"Malgorzata Foremniak (Ash) is a true discovery. And it is strangely wonderful in all respects: story, theme, characters, style, cinematography. Those which are in - your - face (like the rendered vehicles) are done nicely. Beautiful Dreamer was about the boundary between dream and reality, Patlabor 1 about the relationship between mankind and machinery and Patlabor 2 about war in general. Take a quiet place, wind down from the hassle of your day and let yourself sink into illusions which might even show the occasional glint of YOUR reality."
3921,"Once a powerful force in a young Hollywood, Thomas Ince (Cary Elwes )--who had formed Triangle Films with D. W. Griffith and Mack Sennett, and later founded Paramount Studios with Adolph Zukor--has fallen on hard times. It's one of the subtle, underlying nuances that Herrmann brings to his portrayal, which is altogether convincing and believable. The film is highlighted by a number of excellent and memorable performances, beginning with Herrmann as Hearst. Obsession, combined with jealousy, was the impetus for an incident that occurred in November of 1924, aboard the yacht of media mogul William Randolph Hearst, and which in the years since has become the stuff of Hollywood legend and lore. The story has many versions, but the ` whisper told most often ,' is the one recounted in ` The Cat's Meow ,' directed by Peter Bogdanovich, a dramatization of what may or may not have happened during that extended weekend birthday - party cruise in honor of pioneer film director, Thomas Ince, which included an eclectic guest list of the rich, famous and powerful."
3922,"There are many different kinds of movies. There are several nice film tricks. There are other more universal moments here. Human Nature is funny, original, and has a message to give to the viewers. Rhys Ifans is absolutely wonderful in his portayal of the apotheosis of the destructive nature of language on human emotion."
6850,"For more insanity, please visit comeuppancereviews. Rooker also looks a great deal younger and in better shape than in THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS or THE BONE COLLECTOR, playing a more youthfully - minded loner as opposed to a tired old sheriff or something. For a van Damme movie the action is very rare and except maybe two scenes not very spectacular. Where this obsession comes from is never explained and this contributes to a lot of the weird aspects of the film. To say the least, it is an interesting performance but it also produces some laughs especially because of the way Rooker treats him."
3677,"Steve Buscemi's cameo was the best part of the movie. Buscemi is great as always, but enough to save this movie. The acting, story everything about this movie has been done before. He gives a convincing performance, capturing the motivations of his character effectively with all the conflict one would expect from a kid in his situation. A relatively good child actor who convincingly plays a stressed, frightened teen boy seems the perfect choice, with his convicingly frightened facial expressions."
3678,"There's a colorful Metropolis, filled with houses, buildings, businesses, cars and everything that makes a city run smoothly along with a population of colorful creatures. The realism of the characters' movements & feelings is perfect. Here's the bonus: if they DO like it, it will (unlike "" Shrek "") actually have a beneficial effect. "" Monsters, Inc. "" is entertainment at its bests. ` Monsters, Inc.' is the best animated feature this year and one of the greatest of all time."
3804,"To sum it up, it has an unusual plot, great acting, and ideas below the surface. Nicole Kidman gives a really good performance (worthy of a better film) but Ben Chaplin is just OK. Other times the actors and especially Nicole Kidman give this comedy quite expertly a dramatic slant. The story is engaging and it doesn't take long before the chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin grabs your attention. Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman co-star, and are very good as are Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz as Kidman's Russian cohorts."
4367,"The performances here are first - rate, too. All of the pieces came together with a genuine and sincere feel for the period and the people. The household is filled with people going about their lives in an elegant way. All the actors are superb, with Juliane Kohler as Jettel proving a particular standout. For Jettel is clearly the most interesting and complex character in the movie."
3589,"The best performances were given by supporting cast members. Along comes Jessica Biel and he is head over heels in love. Fans of Prinze and Biel will enjoy seeing them look sexy for an hour and three quarters. The summer on the Cape is full of babes and booze just like the film shows. Biel and Prinze interact like marble statues, nice to look at but no chemistry whatever."
3679,"The good Li uses motions from the Hong Kong era that are genuine. It isn't entirely devoid of those annoyances, but is much better than most. There are many universes, you look quite similar in everyone and your all connected by a wave of energy. As for the special effects, some of them are really cool, a mixing of bullet time, and slow motion with normal speed, very cool to watch in places. One is a national hero in China where he has a dozen quite good films to his credit."
3935,"Yes, what Musedom he provides for the piss - elegant poetry of her young being. A literary style, namely poetry, make this energetic and non-linear movie a real joy to take in; the mixing of sounds and dialogues or monologues also follow a poetic and jazz - like bee - bop approach. What makes them interesting and what they have in common is that they can't stand the modern world, their perspective on life and the belief that happiness is in simple things. The characters presented are very real and yet also seems like phrases in a continually changing musical piece. It has moments of brilliance but it is in dire need of plot structure."
3681,"The' tricked - ya tricked - ya tricked - ya' type endings are about as creative as a dream - sequence ending. Where twists and double crosses are best is when they are unexpected and surprising. The performances were all great - however the writing talents were not well suited for actors of this caliber. Overall it has good qualities, but the one driving force it needed was a much better story. All Rebecca Pidgeon says is these crafty responses and she engages no real conversation."
3682,"It even beats out "" There's Something About Mary "". It can be done - just look at the classics! See it for Gwyneth if anything, she is very cute in it. The story is solid, with no boring lulls. A lot of this is due to Gwyneth Paltrow, who actually gives one of her best performances."
3586,"As for the rest of the cast, Dan Aykroyd is decent in a small yet significant role, as well as Charlize Theron and Elizabeth Berkeley. Here's an entertaining crime story set in 1939 with nice atmosphere and colors and the normal Woody Allen wacky humor. The ensemble cast all delivered credible performances. Dan Akroyd, David Ogden - Stiers, Wallace Shawn and John Schuck are all veteran comedians who know their trade so the movie offers a lot of quality yuks. Comedy set in 1940 about an insurance investigator (Woody Allen) locking horns with an efficiency expert (Helen Hunt) while a string of suspicious jewel robberies are going on."
3684,"funny scences with Slim - shady, Shaq. For some good giggles, check this one out. All in all The wash is a great Comedy that's laid back and filled with cameos by Ludicrous, Xzibit, Pierre, Kurupt, Shaq, Pauly Shore, and Tommy Chong. Sometimes it's laugh out loud, other times it's so quiet in the theater after a bad joke you can actually hear crickets chirp. the jokes are there, so "" the wash "" is definitely a funny movie."
3685,"A remarkable achievement, this IS the magic of the movies. The cast is outstanding, the special effects delightful, everything most believable. Some aspects of the story are fleshed out on screen and the additions are delightful, completely in keeping with the flavour of the world. Particularly notable performances by Emma Watson and Alan Rickman. An instant classic in every sense of the word, this is truly a film for the ages."
3393,"A fun if totally unbelievable flick that plays like a college version of CLUELESS at times. It's a film that's worth seeing many times over, and that's the magic of the movies. And, for the viewer, right out of the gate this is someone you want to see succeed in her quest, because her triumph--whatever it may be or however it comes out--is going to be one you share right along with her. In the end, not only does "" Legally Blonde "" come off very funny, but also very witty, good - natured and sweet: One of the most pleasant surprises of 2001, indeed. They have very different qualities and this is exploited to the full in their on - screen rivalry."
3686,"The performances are excellent all around. He's VERY pleasing to the eyes. A palette of familiar faces rounds out the cast and all performers do well. He's gorgeous and affecting and is bound to go places if he can avoid type - casting after this. This is not Boogie Nights (it lacks the complexity of that one) but it is nicely done, a little bit funny and engaging."
3936,"A smart flick for smart minds. Final feature film with a full music score composed by John Barry, his music is fascinating likeness to "" Dancing with wolves "" and a lot of hits during his long career thirty years ago. Here he has a decent screenplay from Tom Stoppard, assured direction from Michael Apsted, and three fine performances by British actors. Perhaps crucial historical events, always ambiguous and open to conflicting interpretations, are not the best material for nice and sentimental movies? It is a great pleasure to watch the actors who, unlike others who always play the same role â€“ themselves â€“ can incarnate so many different characters!"
3937,"The end is brilliant and is reminiscent of the other Friday the 13th movies. This was an absolutely fantastic entry, one of the more enjoyable and exciting entries in the series. Jason X is an entertaining blend of horror, sci - fi and comedy, though the film doesn't go very far in any of the three categories alone. This is not The Exorcist, it's not The Omen, it's even a very long way away from the original Friday The 13th, but as director James Isaac has said, "" it's just fun . "" The best part of this is the extremely high - impact action scenes, which generate the best times here."
8479,"Kirsten Storms (Zenon Carr) is even better in this sequel than the first movie, though she still gave a fantastic performance in the first one. The Zequel is in the good tradition of the previous film and good family entertainment from The Magic Kingdom. New and exciting things include ZAP - PADs, which are updated versions of the Communicator, Zenon's new wardrobe, and more insight into the Space - Stay. However, both movies in the series are excellent major! The first Zenon movie was hilariously kitschy."
3939,"Ramps, downgrades, low sweeping curves while interacting with the cement waves beneath their feet. And as with so many such successful, youth - driven revolutions, this one was invented by savvy journalism. They were part of the times and places that was the L. A. beach scene. The topic is one that interests: kids making up something that has no purpose other than being a vehicle for style - and it carrying that meme of style to millions, perhaps hundreds of millions, of kids. It's a great documentary in the way that it is put together, though Stacey Peralta always knew how to do this even when producing the Bones Brigade mini movies / skate demos like "" Ban This "" and "" Search for Animal Chin . """
3687,"He is hilarious as the method actor in search of ways to interpret the real life detective in the movies. Novocaine is a suspense thriller, as well as an extremely funny movie. Sure some of the plot twists are a little implausible, but it's well - acted, told from an unusual point of view and a lot of fun. The most remarkable scenes are those of the great Kevin Bacon as an actor tailing David Keith in preparation for an upcoming police film. Steve Martin is believable as a dentist who sees his life spiraling out of control after a series of cascading lies sets him up as a murder suspect."
3278,"layers and the progress of story work perfectly together and the rhythm flow smoothly. Liv Tyler is amazing, captivating and luscious, and everyone else is dead - on right for their parts. This one will satisfy your urges for the strangeness that is One Night at McCool's. All three of these narratives of obsession are told simultaneously, and all are amusing. Liv Tyler is divine, Matt Dillon's performance amusing and Paul Reiser and John Goodman are just as fantastic as always when they're really giving their best."
3688,"Worth watching if you're in the mood for seeing something stupid but not boring. Without giving anything away, there's a contrived dance scene that arises well into the movie. The reactions and mannerisms of the medieval people are stretched at best, and Lawrence's reactions aren't quite how you'd expect a normal person to act, were he thrown back in time. This was tolerable at best but his best jokes were racial ones. Tom Wilkinson has done some amazing films during his career, but apparently was looking to buy a new car with this film."
8535,"Even here and with laughs galore! Lots of hand held cameras and naturally lit bar and restaurant scenes. with there cowboy hats and perfect everything. The best thing about this movie is that its title is numerical, so it shows up among the first DVDs on Blockbuster's "" New Releases "" wall. he is funny, sweet and yeas sexy."
3689,"Spy Game will probably never be considered among the best spy movies to come out of Hollywood, however, it is a really entertaining movie with quite a few surprises. Every decision, most plot points, and a lot of what would normally be called "" meaningful looks "" are written on Muir's face for a split second, then they're gone. You almost get a sense that if you were to meet him in the street, you'd get someone named Nathan Muir playing the part of Robert Redford - the transformation is that complete. You get a feeling this is pretty close to how the CIA really operates, a place with fantastic technology at its disposal but who's ultimate effectiveness is determined by the fallible people who run the missions and take the chances. SPY GAME / (2001) *** (out of four) Tony Scott is known for his big budget, fast - paced, action - packed extravaganzas."
3690,"With many developments along the way that shock, move, and thrill. Ten stars for this hauntingly lovely epic. The acting is superb, from the children as well as the adults. The metaphors he uses (the bomb, the pool, the contents of the jars) are rich and creative. Guillermo del Toro has made a masterpiece with "" The Devils Backbone . """
3691,"the raw emotional power imbued into the scenes with Wilkinson and Spacek are Oscar - worthy. The valuable and rare thing here is that the story works against the most common plot at the movies today: the revenge plot. Although it is a searing and unflinching look at nearly unspeakable grief, it is poignant and thoughtful and even has scenes of humor if you are ready for it. All the actors and acting are excellent, with a particularly subtle and brilliant portrayal by Tom Wilkinson as Dr. Fowler. Excellent performances turned in by Spacek, Wilkinson, Tomei, as well as all the supporting players."
3345,"But F&F is all muscle and sheer bravado. It has several intensely dramatic scenes, some of the most incredible car chase scenes, and some deeply esoteric verbal exchanges fraught with emotion. Accompanied by a rocking soundtrack, the action sequences are put together by flawless editing and elaborate stunts, effectively creating a maddening adrenaline rush in any viewer. The acting is great as well, as usual Vin Diesel gives a brilliant performance, as Dominic Toretto. The movie features strong acting, as the actors work well together and compliment each other's performances."
3716,"All this and more in one of the greatest movies of all time. The characters were solid, and director John Moore emphisised the war - torn cities of Bosnia quite well (which was one of the highlights of the film). Owen Wilson, did a good job at portraying a character way out of his comfort zone, and Vladimir Mashkov was chilling as a Serbian sniper. The rest of the world mocks America because of movies like this."
4415,"The colors are beautiful and the sound is good. An extraordinary film, great landscapes, great birds. From ultra-light planes to hot air balloons, to hang gliders the camera operators managed to capture what must be the most amazing shots of flying ever filmed. The colors and the backgrounds behind the different species are photographed with such an eye to detail that one wonders the miracle of the technology behind it. It's surprising that this documentary has been shown in art houses to grown ups, mainly."
4817,"Yet, in the modern world these works of art endure in photos and videos. Andy Goldsworthy has managed to create an amalgam of all of these aspects of his life that looks like it works very well, and is nourishing for him and those around him. This cinematic production directed by Thomas Riedelsheimer with the beautiful and appropriately haunting music by Fred Frith is not to be missed. His strings of leaves, or hair, or wool, or his wreathes of sticks, or ice, or his piles of rocks in cone shapes, or circles, or spirals, or lines, are done over and over, and the film focuses constantly on Goldsworthy working on piece after similar piece. He's gentle with nature; his pieces are generally meant to collapse and fade back into the environment from whence they came."
3326,"The chemistry between the leads is fantastic. Of course, Orlando Jones is the funniest in the bunch. This movie makes no pretensions--it's a simple, fun summer movie full of special effects. Special effects--the alien creatures--rocks. "" Evolution, "" starring David Duchovny, Orlando Jones, Seann William Scott and Julianne Moore, is a terrific fun summer romp."
3718,"It's worth a rental, especially if you are a fan of x-rated films or Jeremy himself. This movie is a funny, behind - the - scenes peek into the business. As an actor who has appeared in over 1 , 500 x-rated films in his lifetime, Ron Jeremy has achieved cult status. If you aren't interested in porn at all you may still find something worthwhile here because Ron's life is pretty interesting, just in terms of how successful he's been in his transition from porn to Hollywood (nabbing some roles in major films, including Trey Parker's "" Orgazmo ""). Twenty years after he made his adult film debut Ron Jeremy is still a porn star, only these days he is a chunky, sloppy one who commands a following largely due to his unlikely appearance and quasi-comic persona and who continues the career thanks to that near - inhuman control."
3719,"However, everything is put together perfectly. It will live forever as the epitome of cool for years to come. The extra features on the DVD really explain it all. The result is a great, fun, fast paced film that moves so fast at some parts that if you blink, you'll miss it. Well, he has certainly found it with this property, which sails along smoothly like a well - oiled machine, with no angst - filled messages or heavy - handed themes to gum up the works."
3720,"The last scenes come as magical and "" one of a kind "" as the ones in "" The Children of Heaven "". Majid Majidi has the ability to make every frame and every shot beautiful and enigmatic. The technical aspects are simple like an achievement. The story is in some scenes humorous, in others moving. See how just the closeness of their arms and hands to each other evoke such passionate feelings and the way they dig deep into each others eyes is wonderful."
3721,"THE BUSINESS OF STRANGERS looks good and has solid performances. "" The Business of Strangers "" is a stylish piece of work, but it's a bit fraudulent. Viewers should become very edgy as this sequence of mean - spirited events transpires with the never remote possibility of dire consequences ensuing. This man, who, up until he is taken advantage of, appears to be a cordial and sympathetic businessman, is cruelly victimized for no real reason, yet he doesn't seem to suffer anything more than a little bit of confusion. Incidentally, Channing is a Harvard graduate who is perhaps best known for her performance as Betty Rizzo in Grease (1978) playing a teenager when she was 32 - years - old!"
4429,"he's perfect in it, so is Zooey, she's absolutely beautiful in her character. Then you add the ward Doctor, Don Cheadie, he's just, amazing in this. Put in the cinematic dustbin since its screening at Sundance in 2001, Jordan Melamed's Manic is deserving of an audience. Without a doubt one of the best scenes was a spontaneous mosh pit that erupted around the playing of a cassette of the Deftones. Zooey Descchanel yet again proves herself the best young actress around in a demanding role and as mentioned, Don Cheadle near steals the film and provides a much needed strong central foundation in an otherwise dramatically and thematically uncertain script."
3259,"Prepare for lots of laughs and romance when you see it. Someone Like You had so much promise. There are no surprises, some smiles and chuckles, and you'll feel good because the characters are basically nice folks. There is also a sparkling performance by Marisa Tomei as Jane's best friend. When you put it all into perspective, you realize that ` Someone Like You' is actually a real treat."
3722,"One of the best choices the Academy ever made! Danis Tanovic wrote and directed a debut that easily is one of the best films since the new Millennium. There were a lot of scenes which are funny, and all the viewers laughed and clapped for the witty statements. This is such a sad story with plenty of extremely touching scenes. No Man's Land & another Bosnian co-production, Saviour, both stand as two of the best films on the subject of war made in the past decade."
3723,"Anyone with a serious interest in urban America in the '70s should see it. Technically behind the scenes: film editor David Tedeschi - the exquisite seamless Black and White scenes immediately followed by color scenes and continuously in and out of color and B / W - it's amazing! As you watch this film, keep you eye on Bratt's honest moments. Along with the selection of lively Latin songs and the film score by Kip Hanrahan, Claudio Chea's cinematography, no doubt, adds to this ensemble piece of work. Director Leon Ichaso ("" Hendrix "") does a great job with the direction, including many standout flashback sequences."
3258,"After arranging an appointment with vick vetors valdean reveals that jo and gilly are siblings! But it still has that Farrelly vibe, since J. B. Rogers worked as the A. D. in their previous works. Valdean jo's mother played by hilarious actress sally field is too busy focusing on jo's ex boyfriend jacks money and does her best to break the two lovers apart. Fans who like her best during her Gidget / Flying Nun years will be just as surprised as those who praise her for Sybil, Norma Rae, Places in the Heart, and similar TV - Movies & tear - jerkers. Anyway, this movie has a lot of sleaze, a lot of heart, and a lot of surprises."
3727,"Not a lot of movies create their own sort of universe. A simple smile on the old's man face, a close - up of AmÃ©lie's hand letting the copied key slide into her pocket and the heart beat as a background sound would have done the same without disturbing the atmosphere. In this world, Paris actually, Audrey Tautou is the perfect inhabitant. Right in the beginning when AmÃ©lie's mother is introduced, the picture is balanced symbolizing her pursuit for correctness and cleanliness. a 21 - year - old AmÃ©lie fan who can enjoy the little things in life again"
3257,"It's entertaining, there's some laughs and some nice moments, and it's easy on the eyes. Overall, a good way to spend a couple hours at the movies. Lee has an especially engaging screen presence, and some of the most memorable moments of the film are in the scenes he shares with Hewitt. Plus looking at Jennifer love Hewitt in a series of brightly coloured micro dresses is fabulous. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sigourney Weaver deliver performances that are both sexy and funny."
3728,"To top it off, the scene is still funny even if you haven't seen either targets. "" Breakfast Club, "" "" Sixteen Candles, "" "" Pretty In Pink, "" etc. "" Not Another Teen Movie "" is absolutely hilarious. It has surprisingly good plot cohesion while still making fun of a variety of teen movies. Name one other movie that manages to make fun of over 12 teen movies at the same time and maintain plot cohesion. Not Another Teen Movie makes fun of movies from the 80's to the 90's and is very clever."
3254,"His action scenes are always fun to watch. Semi-interesting characters, a few plot twists here and there, steady, interesting action, flashy directing, decent performances, plenty of cool explosions, exciting car chases, and numerous excellent violent death scenes. DMX delivers the most engaging performance in Exit Wounds. But Seagal's action scenes have a sense of originality and flare. Wow, what a change of pace for a man who makes ecological statement thrillers."
3729,"Crowe's other musical selections, such as The Beach Boys, Josh Rouse, Spiritualized, Sigur Ros, the Monkees, etcetera etcetera, are also perfect fits for the film (Crowe has an ear for great music). Particularly, "" Njosnavelin "" by Sigur Ros, which is an amazing song. It mixes and matches different elements and genres. This film is one of Tom Cruise's finest films. He takes things for granted and it comes around full swing in this great movie with a superb twist."
3730,"Altogether, a brilliant film, concise, humurous, terribly sad--and enhanced by four brilliant performances. It has three very good actors and one truly great complex one (Winslet). The co-screenwriter did some multidimensional work in the past. There are definitely flashes and similarities between the four actors who play the two characters flawlessly. "" Iris - "" You must get some new vests."
3969,"This is an extreme version of a dynamic which is at play amongst many Jews and non-Jews today. Like "" American History X, "" this movie contains disturbing scenes where the protagonist articulately expresses his bigoted ideas. Daniel Balint is a promising new right wing extremist who, with his radical ideas and eloquence, wins over the minds of a small group of neo-Nazis. Ryan Gosling who plays Daniel is a frightening good actor, who almost manages to persuade the audience of his anti-semitic views. His intimate knowledge of Jewish beliefs and practices looks strange to his fellow skinheads, to say the least."
4450,"The writing is crisp and intelligent, the sub-plots funny and well - defined and the acting uniformly excellent, with Tony LoBianco's "" Don Patrizzi "" an understated stand - out. This visit scenario is but one way in which this film shows and old dog some very funny new tricks. What a breath of fresh air it is to see a movie that goes back to the basics of classic comedy rather than pandering to the current vogue of substituting posing and attitude for genuine humor. The first time you watch it, you'll enjoy the punchlines and situations The second time you'll appreciate the clever story and plot. This is meant to be fun and lighthearted (its not the Sopranos) and it delivers."
3731,"Afghan and Indian music was distributed secretly at great risk during the Taliban reign. The above song btw is is called Sri Satya Sai Suprbhatham and probably almost every Hindu in India would have heard this song! Aadhaaya Divya Kusumaani Manoharaani Sreepaada Poojana Vidhim Bhavadanghri Mooley Karthum Mahothsukathayaa Pravishanti Bhakthaah Sri Sathya Sai Bhagawan Thava Suprabhatham (Meaning: Bringing holy flowers with captivating colors and fragrance, for worshipping Thy Lotus Feet, in the form as prescribed by the scriptures, Thy devotees are coming in, with great yearning and enthusiasm. The legacy of Hafiz, Rumi & other great Persian poets flavors the vivid poetics of Makhmalbaf's cinematography, dialog, and plot structure. Through a series of vignettes, the movie succeeds beautifully in revealing insights that are both fascinating and harrowing."
3277,"While it's not nearly as good as those three flicks, it certainly is an interesting and occasionally intriguing picture. Well casted horror film offers realistic performances, nice atmosphere, good editing, well chosen soundtrack, some interesting twists to vampire folklore, and one of the sexiest casts to appear in a horror film in quite some time. Cardone persuasively makes the point that the allegedly "" lost "" and hopeless Generation X has a latent capacity to amount to something; all they need is the right stimulus to spark them into action. In this road movie, he encounters quirky characters in the deserts, canyons and plains of the Southwest. Writer / director J. S. ("" The Slayer, "" "" Shadowzone "") Cardone elicits sound performances from the entire cast (veteran late, great character actress Carrie Snodgress in particular contributes a lively last reel cameo as a feisty old battle axe), keeps the unflagging pace fast 'n' furious throughout, and, most importantly, delivers the unapologetically lowdown sleazy goods with a winning dearth of pretense and a hugely satisfying surplus of rip - snorting panache."
3732,"For others, it's subtle and personal. The classic' mystery' thread was really only the setting for the several different relationships and couples featured in the film. This sincere, uncompromising picture places the lack of communication at the center of family problems. "" Lantana "" investigates real people who deal with real situations and encounter real consequences. Those qualities make the characters absorbing."
3743,"He's on the verge of making 1st - rate films, has an actress girlfriend, and is respected by all. By the end of this movie you will love the movies, love America, and love Jim Carrey. His efforts in The Majestic are simply amazing. It is to be enjoyed by anyone. He is content to live surrounded by people who admire him, Luke's girlfriend Adele, and work in the Majestic movie theater, unaware that he has both another life and a government agency waiting to catch up to him."
3733,"Anderson favors primary colors, and characters that are identifiable by very distinct appearances. The Royal Tenenbaums is an altogether thrilling experience. This is brilliant film on every level, a delight for the senses and for the mind. The Tenenbaums are a wealthy New York family of eccentric genuises, headed by Angelica Huston. Along with Pallana's inspired creation, comes Anderson's strongest hand - background players."
3739,"Especially notable was Mike Epps who portrayed Babypowder the Pimp. Unless you smoked a lot of "" grass "" back in the 70's. The supporting cast is terrific as well, including the clueless Fred Willard and uptight Obba Babatunde. This film is far funnier than the last two "" Friday "" films combined (Yes, let's just compare it to other pothead comedies). How High is just what Amercia needed in this year, a funny flick that doesn't take itself seriously."
3614,"In spite of its rather predictable set up Hardball is remarkably effective. But Hardball was strong cinematic fare and well worth a look. Cabrini - Green is now under redevolopment in what's a bold mixed income experiment, incorporating low / no - income citizens into what an area that was always surrounded by prime real estate. The young, unknown boys give outstanding performances which are matched by a moving performance by Keanu Reeves. New York Times and local reviewers aside--way aside, this movie is definitely worth a look."
4458,"Adrien Brody is outstanding in this one, and Charlotte Ayanna is also good. It's fun to watch the now famous Adrien Brody interact with the warm and pretty Charlotte Ayanna, the great Jon Seda of Homicide, and that Tarantino - revived 70's icon Pam Grier. Brody, however, makes up the slack in the script with every shot of his wonderfully expressive eyes. Brody carries this film, and the lovely Charlotte Ayanna is unfortunately not given nearly as much to work with. Despite the dismal reviews this little known movie received, this movie is a true gem."
3253,""" War of the Rats "" was a powerful, moving dramatization of Zaitsev and the Soviet snipers who fought at Stalingrad, as well as the Germans who opposed them. More important is the masterful manner of speech of the actors - Bob Hoskins' gutteral exultations as Ukrainian potato farmer Nikita Krushchev; Joseph Fiennes' pompous and proud intonations as the political officer; Jude Law's common man for the peasant turned soldier; Ed Harris with the clipped and crisp tones of a German officer. The love affair between Zaitsev and the female soldier Tania (Weisz) does not add to the suspense, but is forgivable. Writer / Director Jean - Jacques Annaud, writer Alain Goddard, and cinematographer Robert Fraisse treat the subject matter with great care towards authenticity and entertainment value. It is easily superior to the likes of Platoon, the equal of more esoteric war films such as Three Kings, and it is miles above the likes of Saving Private Ryan and Pearl Harbour."
4464,"During the film, during the featurette included at the end of the DVD - it's amazing. More often than not, it's simply cloudy and ill - defined values. The warmth of scenes in the family's church were well juxtaposed with the sterile wood paneled cortroom. As such, McGuiness is a likeable and honest guide, his interviews are scattered throughout him working the court and he makes interesting observations. For those interested in race relations in the United States, and the actual workings of law enforcement and the legal process, it's well worth your time and effort to find this documentary."
3740,"Speaking of kids, the nerdy - looking fat kid obviously was the funniest in here. Whilst it may not have the adult humour of other animations (mainly the greatest animation of them all, "" Shrek ""), it does still have the occasional funny joke that will make people of all ages laugh. Jimmy is no exception, tossing in the mandatory kiddie fare with some sharp references and unique character play. Carl, Jimmy's best friend is a llama - loving dunce while Sheen is "" Ultra-Lord "" obsessed - an EXCELLENT parody on the fan boy generation. Wait a tick, Isn't Steve Oddekerk the guy who played the chosen one in the hilarious Kung Pow: enter the fist."
3741,"Some of their scenes together are the best in the movie. That all said, it is a charming movie that could have been a blockbuster hit the likes of Sleepless but is not. great if you have nothing else to do and like chick - flicks. Those not hung up with identifying finer points of historical inaccuracy, go ahead and enjoy the movie. He is so charming and charismatic that you can hardly resist falling head over heels for him!"
3742,"Hobbiton is cute and very whimsical. The unspoiled New Zealand locales are spectacular, providing a variety of environments to represent the different settings on the characters' journey. You could tell from the first glimpse that Frodo was special; Wood's pale, sharp features contrast sharply with the more ruddy, robust look of the rest of the hobbits. The assault of the riders at Weathertop is another great example, and it captures that feeling of danger, density and atmosphere that are the main characteristics of the tale. It is the second part of this great trilogy and there are more climatic scenes."
3744,"And yes, this does have some very, very touching moments. At any rate, it's certainly one of the best movies of the year. There are some truly shocking moments in A Beautiful Mind. Added to that the stellar performances of Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris and Adam Goldberg, and this made for the' perfect' movie. This movie provided a brilliant (pardon the pun) insight into many aspects of a genius at work."
3276,"This is definitely one of Sly's better movies. it has a great plot, good action scenes and a kick ass soundtrack. The movie's tagline, "" Welcome to the human race, "" does a nice job of encompassing all that this film discusses. But overall it is quite entertaining with the racing scenes and the variety of locations they go to. She's been great in other movies like Bound and especially The Insider."
3344,"If you like these kind of movies, then its funny. This is fun for the whole family adults and children will enjoy it. While this little film won't change your life, it's a decent film that won't insult your intelligence and will give you a few good laughs. Yes, it's full of jokes based on body fluids (both gaseous and liquid), but even those can be funny. Its amazing how well they can train bears, some of the stunts are incredible."
3754,"In fact the boxing scenes in this film, are of the finest quality. They're in the same part of the ring when they throw those punches. The story to this film was interesting, as it had many fascinating facets to it. Will Smith is outstanding as Ali, vocally and visually, Jon Voight is a unbelievably convincing Howard Cosell, and Mario Van Peebles is subtle and moving as Malcom X. But the "" Loud mouth "" CHAMPs witty and "" punchy "" remarks in his real life along, with his big blows inside the ring, will keep you glued for more."
4515,"that that is pretty darn well. Sorimachi is properly dour and brooding, almost phlegmatic. Simon Yam is Inspector Lee of Interpol who leads a team going after both of the killers and who (literally in one case) are always just a step behind them. He is played by Japanese actor Takashi Sorimachi, another good choice in casting. Its haunting theme weave in well with the scenes, and made them alive."
3755,"When talking about war movies, there are many great ones that immediately spring to mind. It's an astonishing achievement that puts you right in the middle of the hellish horror faced by U. S. soldiers in Somalia in 1993. Technically, this movie is an amazing feat that gives the viewer one of the most realistic impressions of what it would feel like to be in the middle of a war, which makes the atrocities of the event seem all the more real. And you'd better believe there will be subsequent viewings, because Ridley Scott has created one of cinema's all - time great pieces of eye candy here. Since this based on true incident let's pay respect to those who sacrificed their lives and salute those who have lived another day to fight."
3757,"It is in these changes, however, where Altman charms his audiences in a new way. Despite its intricacies and confusing moments, there is so much more to Gosford Park that makes it interesting and enchanting. Robert Altman's long, fragmented and very hit - or - miss career reaches another of his periodic highs with this clever and beautifully realised dissection of the English class system and skit on the classic Agatha Christie whonunnit. Throughout the film Altman visually shows the audience the contrast between social classes through his various shots, lighting techniques, and camera filters. Novello oustays his welcome, amongst the gentry, but the servants cant get enough."
3758,"Pfeiffer perfectly executes a complex character who has to undergo a number of far reaching transformations and even a breakdown of sorts. He lives in Santa Monica and works at Starbucks. Wiest, Richard Schiff, Laura Dern and others also turn in very complex performances that convey characters with deep, multifaceted histories, despite their relatively little screen time. Sams friends, very well played by Brad Silverman, Joseph Rosenberg, Stanley DeSantis and Doug Hutchinson are very important support characters. All of the major cast members give one of the best performances of their careers, and many of these actors have had a number of artistic triumphs on their rÃ©sumÃ©s."
3759,"This is of course also thanks to excellent performances. He makes you a part of this world in which Hank, Leticia and the others live--there's no standing on the sidelines with this one. This truly is SOLID filmaking that takes real chances with provocative subject matter. Every aspect of Thorton's and Berry's performances is the result of very savvy Direction and attention to dramatic detail. It's a terrific performance, delivered with nuance and restraint, and it should have earned him an Oscar nomination, as it was clearly one of the best performances of the year."
3343,"The film is similar to the posterior: Â¨ the cradle of the life Â¨, it has a likeness chum (Daniel Craig - Gerard Butler), equal performers (Noah Taylor and Chris Barrie) with gorgeous as well as spectacular scenarios. To her credit, she went to extreme lengths to get herself physically - fit for the role. Audio-wise, this is a one of the better DVDs you will ever hear, with excellent use of the surround speakers. Nice scenery, a sharp picture and low profanity also are pluses. Her acting, stunts (which she did most of herself), and her wonderful diction with a British accent, were a true delight."
3273,"Although it has some geniuinely funny scenes (especially the ones featuring Rip Torn) many scenes exist purely for their shock value. Other "" gross - out "" comedies present their vulgarities with the sober convention, creating a pornographic aura that is shameful instead of funny. The film's brilliant re-invention of comic film - making technique creates an intellectual framework that invites an oppositional reading to some of the vulgar content on screen. And there's the wonderful little boy who spends the whole movie getting accidentally brutalized, hit by cars and running into airplane propellers, always with much blood and flying viscera. Freddy Got Fingered may not be the "" laughiest "" picture of the year, but it is surely the most original."
3766,Le Pacte des Loups is a fairly impressive movie. Gans' use of Kwok gives the movie a well presented quality throughout. The two leads are fantastic and share a chemistry reminiscent of the relationship between Butch and Sundance. The cinematography combined with the editing makes for some truly fantastic scenes. Some movies become great because they have that one moment that will forever live on in your memory; Moments that are undoubtedly awesome.
3768,"Almost every shot holds a fascination, intimates meanings, symbolism; the ineffable is almost made manifest. But that stunning ending changed everything and called into question all that came before it. The film moves slow and it has little dialogue, as is Tsai's style, but it is incredibly beautiful in its composition, editing, everything. and decides to set all his watches (he sells them on the street) to Paris time, and then all the clocks in his house, and then all the clocks he can find. In one celebrated scene, the girl meets Jean - Pierre Leud, who played the lead role in "" Les Quatre - Cents Coups "", in a Paris cemetery."
3978,"Matthew McConaughey's depiction of Troy is good. The ties between these disparate stories are wondrously woven, and the sudden eye - opening twists are amazing. 13 Conversations is intelligent, moving, and beautiful. Ms. Sprecher shows an insight that is rare in the young directors starting in the business today. The lawyer Troy (Matthew McConaughey), the actuary Gene (Alan Arkin), the physical science professor Walker (John Turturro) and the housecleaner Beatrice (Clea DuVall) have their lives connected through some sort of event."
3777,"The special effects here are pretty good as well. The special effects were 1st rate, locations, cinematography, acting, all very, very good. It's the kind of stuff great "" Twilight Zone "" episodes were made of. D'Onofrio makes a fabulous driven investigator. Sinise is excellent, Stowe is pretty and sensual as usual and D'Onofrio is over the top, as usual."
3272,"The sequel (Dundee II) was very good and that should have been the end of it. The movie didn't fare well, maybe because the humor dominated instead of a balanced mix of it with drama, humor and romance as the other two films emphasized. this is a good oldfashioned movie without any big special effects. Despite that this sequel had enough funny moments and jokes, including one very surprising cameo appearance. It's fun to let go and get in on the silliness of the jokes."
6586,"The photography is just extraordinary; all the colors on screen are amazing. This movie has great cinematography and music score, and an awesome and impressive performance of Selton Mello. Lavoura Arcaica is indeed a very beautiful and unusual film. All the actors' performances are great. The scenes are very well built and the director truly owns this movie."
3595,"It definitely highlights the theme of' Everything comes full Circle ,' which the Title' O ,' implies. Martin Sheen, John Heard, Rain Phoenix and Elden Henson, are the most prominent figures in the cast. Quite correctly, the film is aimed at a teenage audience, with a smorgasboard of hot young talent. Good thing Lions Gate bought it and released it. Phifer is remarkable in his role, but Hartnett steals the show in a performance that he's never outdone."
3836,"The commentary by the two Bobs alone makes it worthwhile. Like the original (The Longest Yard), it was made to entertain the audience, not to provoke some deep introspective thought on the existence of God. Of course the story isn't anything new (like most sports flicks) but the humour brings out the charm. Substituting Gridiron for Soccer, director Barry Skolnick, along with his roll call of British "" faces "", is only aiming for one market. While also putting in scene stealing shifts of note are Jamie Sives, Vas Blackwood and Omid Djalili."
3594,"Salva's imagery, however, is always striking. Especially good is Salva's patience in developing his sibling protagonists, their dialogue and reading good enough to establish what most genre work can't even dream of--plausible characters. Definitely Salva's finest work up - to - date, leaving his poor debut feature "" Powder "" far behind. The creature itself is also a good presence even if it does lose a little bit of its creepiness when the wings come out. It's creepy, it's silly, and, if you can get over yourselves for a minute, lots of fun."
3583,"It's one of the best popcorn comedies of 2001. Out and out laughs, a great time at the movies. Jon Lovitz was excellent in this film, along with Mr. Bean (or Rowan Atkinson as he is called by non-Mr. He was the only good reason to watch Seinfeld. "" Rat Race "" also contains a terrific cast and provides enough laughs to be worthy of at least one viewing."
3347,"( Especially one monologue by Mr Rhames--phenomenal, Sir! ) He takes her to the room and proceeds to give her funnylinguis. Tyrese and Snoop Dogg were the most convincing of characters in this movie. Baby Boy, the sequel - cum - remake of Singleton's last great feat Boyz 'N' the Hood, returns to the same neighborhoood 10 years later to look at new people in the hood, very personally at that, and it is fascinating. She is given to fits of rage for the most simplest things and never talks to Jody with respect period."
3989,"Unbelievable scenes with wonderful photography and chilling (no pun intended) moments. Vast landscapes of snow and ice are contrasted with the confines of the igloo and tent. It is a beautiful story based on an Inuit legend that exists on many different levels and subplots, etc. . Much of the movies' strength comes the sheer originality of the culture. Where survival in a lethal environment is moment to moment, social rules broken have immediate consequences not only for individuals but for the whole community, which usually consisted of no more than a dozen or so related individuals."
3348,Finally --- the DVD is also great. It is really far better than most teen movies. A definate thumbs up for a night's rental. Dunst is already familiar to film audiences--making great strides at a very young age with Vampire--but this could arguably be her finest turn. Now this sounds fairly ho hum but is brought successfully to the screen by very strong acting performances from both Dunst and Hernandez and also by Bruce Davison who plays Nicole's Dad Tom.
3641,"It has moments of supreme slapstick humor as well as hilarious dialog. The plot is basically just a way to get all of the sports in and the funny scenes are put in along the way. Yeah, the storyline is a little cheesy, but how many clean films like this are there anymore with this much fun action. It has some very funny scenes (playing spoons) and some great shots of extreme sports. They had good, not to mention FINE actors."
3394,"And ` The Score' is certainly very entertaining on its own terms. ` The Score' is a fun, stylish return to the ` Rififi ,' ` Topkapi' school of crime drama. Overall a really good film that will leave audiences with their jaws on the floor. The score is a big one: a 16th century royal scepter worth $30 million dollars. Set in Canada, there were great shots of Montreal in this film, and a sharp DVD picture to show off the city."
3793,"Nonetheless, it's interesting, has good visuals and decent sound and some genuine creepy moments. Rather, in the space of 90 minutes he has somehow managed to travel 400 miles to Point Pleasant, West Virginia. The effects of the occurrences on the small town of Point Pleasant are well explored, as many different aspects and accounts are introduced. The Mothman Prophecies is a solid thriller. The use of sound is most effective as well, with all sorts of bizarre noises being heard, including the odd screeching noise that the Mothman was said to have made in some of the real accounts."
4095,"It ranks up there with "" The Other Side of Heaven "" and "" Roots and Wings . "" The quality is better than most LDS films to date. It made you feel like change is possible and you can accomplish anything with God's help. "" Charly "" is a top - notch film for the LDS genre. "", but then he accepts God's' wise decision' and becomes such a much better mormon than before and a "" break into tears sign "" for the audience appears."
5893,"A must see for anyone between the ages of 20 - 40. The cast was inspiring and a fun look at where some of them were just 4 years ago and how far they have come. It has so many truths and is hilarious. The film is smart and thoughtful, giving a variety of perspectives on the subject matter. It is a romantic comedy that all ages can relate to."
4596,"The characters are very good representations of the youth of the late 90's. It is in fact a very good 80's style, Splatter, B - movie. The hunting squirrels joke is a perfect example. Another thing that has been trashed by many reviews is the strange sense of humor the film has. The movie stars Rider Strong (from Boy Meets World), Jordan Ladd (Broken Lizard Club Dread), Cierina Vincent (whose "" spolier "" featured in two steamy sex scenes one of which is good and another is okay at first then it gets weird."
4599,"She sounds fabulous, and she has beautiful eyes. The special features on the DVD are fun. The funniest bits are more understated than they are in the bigger - budget comedies with the in - your - face â€“ appeal to the broadest possible audience stuff. "" Dummy "" is a fine example of not compromising, in order to harvest the biggest - possible box - office receipts. Farmiga is charming, especially considering the impossibility of her job."
3803,"Devon Sawa did also a pretty good job. Of course it's dumb, but who cares, you'll get a few laughs and feel like you did something worthwhile for two hours. Scenes that should have been fun turned out to be off - putting & incredibly juvenile. These two upstage Sawa and Schwartzman easily. It also helps that they are included in the films funnier scenes."
4620,"The voice, the hair, the mannerisms are all perfect. The biggest asset the film has is its performances. BUBBA HOTEP is a magnificent blending of many different styles and genres. ' Bubba' succeeds where others have failed. Coscarelli and cinematographer Adam Janeiro easily capture a nice dreamlike atmosphere in the retirement home and grounds, with the fantastic hallways especially standing out."
4621,"Demonlover makes skillful use of extreme close - ups and intense sound. Demonlover is in many ways an interesting movie. Same industrial' cool' spaces, same underacted performances (Nielsen is brilliant) and all in all a plot that goes off track near the end. It's a far more subtle and nuanced movie than the kind of head trip movies that kids go for these days ("" Requiem for a Dream, "" bleh! ) Admittedly, DEMONLOVER makes a sharp left narrative turn at the halfway point that's going to confound viewers who are intrigued by the straightforward (and extremely absorbing) high - stakes opening."
4622,"Aided by voice - overs and a montage of black and white images, this has a feel of historic truth, a sense of actuality about it. This film's outstanding achievement is the sense it conveys that despite the ubiquity of television, mobile phones and the English language, this is still a big, poor and very beautiful world. Acting is naturalistic: there are some brilliant cameo shots - and Winterbottom has achieved a Herculean task; the film comes across as a real, hands - on documentary that is unscripted, and where events unfold before one's eyes. It is certainly more vivid an disturbing than most road movies, whether you are talking about "" Stagecoach "" or even "" Thelma and Louise "" - this is gripping stuff indeed, and a good companion to the recent Afghan film "" Osama . "" The effort is commendable but the outcome is at best an average effort at highlighting the problem of refugees."
4623,"YOSSI & JAGGER (Yossi VeJager) Aspect ratio : 1. Ohad Knoller and Yehuda Levi give good performances as Yossi and Jagger. Hook up with someone in Europe and make a great movie there. Y&J is a so heartbreakingly beautiful. There's still much to admire, and any reservations are dispelled by the central romance, depicted with disarming frankness and performed with relish by Knoller and Levi."
4630,"Throughout ÃŠtre et avoir there are moments that are tremendously moving, which pop up instantly without warning. There are wonderful moments of the humanity of young children and pre-adolescents. It captures the changing of seasons in particular to moving effect. You realize he's just a boy â€“ full of possibilities. And yet - if ever a film deserves patience in overcoming its initial longeurs, this is it."
7508,"Basically it is nothing more than a handful slapstick jokes packed into slightly over 3 minutes. He is proud of it until things go awfully wrong. His dialogue consists of murmurs and sounds of pondering, highlighting Sully's perplexed bewilderment. Now the thing with a Pixar short is that it has to aim for the jugular in its first attempt. The plot is a simple one, featuring merry mishaps of Mike and Scully while working with the technologically advanced car."
7400,"The makers must have thought that Home Alone 3 was going to be as big a success. Kevin is still 9 more than 10 years later. The first 2 Home Alone films were very successful in the early 90s. The original Kevin hurled bricks and he laid complex systems of traps involving fire, electricity, and sharp objects. The first 2 (and a bit of the 3rd) movies also benefited from a very strong musical score that elevated them far beyond a typical family comedy."
6044,"It is very nice to see the boys so full of life even in their weak situation. Characters are well built and played. It was fun before Kata came, when boys were having fun. The real star here is Yusa, the crazy guy. This movie which has also had some success at festivals around the world is evidence that Finland can produce international quality movies."
3809,"Well, some stunts are really impressive. Frankie Muniz, Paul Giamatti, and especially Amanda Bynes all provide excellent performances. It's a well - written story with some very important messages. In fact, the best parts of the film occur near the beginning when Jason and his adventures stay connected to the real world. And, third, like any good fantasy for children, it puts the kids in a position of power over the adult world."
3810,"For this , 54 year old Arnie still has impressive biceps, and things do heat up a bit at the end. That he can travel on someone else's pass is also amazing. If that is not the most unbelievable plot you can imagine, then there are some twists and turns that are even more incredible. "" Collateral Damage "" touches on the subject briefly - enough to humanize the terrorist leader, even! Still, the movie IS entertaining (apart from a few minutes of boredom and confusion in the Columbia part) and, surprisingly, well - acted."
3811,"John McTiernan, director of such classics as' The Predator' and' Die Hard' has managed to make a movie, that is in one word, poor. This movie will depress anyone who loves movies. But what is really incredible, even in a terrible movie, is that, in spite of the enormous technological improvements, the scenes of the game, and related special effects, are by far less spectacular, exciting, violent than those of the 1975 "" Rollerball "". In the self - centered and hedonistic 70's, isn't it amazing the true gist of the original film is the attempt to keep a famous player from becoming bigger than the game he plays?"
3821,"She was always perfect while the people who surrounded her had prominent flaws. You're much better off using that money to see a better film currently in theatres. The funny thing is, the film has absolutely no redeeming features at all. Most of the situations and dialog are silly, and there are many close - range shots of a pretty, smiling Britney. Compared to good young actresses, Britney is fairly amateurish."
3822,"Both performances are intense and emotional. Such are the subtle layers to the storyline. Collin Farrell displays a good deal of screen charisma as Lt. Hart. A lot of what is uttered during the "" court - room "" sequences has great relevance in all facets of life - IF you care to listen. It's a well produced film with fine cinematography of stark snowy scenes from Alar Kivilo (who also did "" Frequency "" with director Hoblit); score to this war film was complemented (unexpectedly) by British composer Rachel Portman; and performances by a talented cast."
4701,"Perhaps because it was extremely tight - with no needless scenes. He captures that period between childhood and adulthood with just the right mix of emotions. Ruane has a simpler role but works OK it in, likewise Fulton, Abercromby and others all turn in natural performances. It's moments of levity are welcome, but few. The performances are stellar throughout, only the mother's character is weak."
4702,"James Marsden, Gary Oldman, Christopher Lloyd, and Amy Smart all turn in stellar performances. It is full of surprises and features an excellent Gary Oldman and an hilarious Chris Cooper. The actors did a great job and Chris Cooper was hysterical. The journey carries him through a mystical potpourri of different people, places, and adventures. As it is, director Bob Gale makes the best of things and it's a reflection on how strong the story is that he can get away with it on a measly budget."
4704,"Snappy editing and a well - timed score heighten the horrors that pack nanchuka punches to the guts. The Eye tells a good story and tells it well, with strong characters and genuine scares. The performances are all wonderful, and the feelings of loss, alienation, fear and determination are genuine and powerful. The Eye is an original and innovative film and yet it is also a perfect mixture of plot points and elements drawn from such previous films as The Sixth Sense, The Mothman Prophecies and Blink, all of which are very good films in their own right. The rest of the film is certifiably creepy, but there is actually a decent story to support those creepy parts."
3823,"Once again Denzel Washington has outdone himself in this delightful movie. *** Starring: Denzel Washington, Kimberly Elise, Robert Duvall, and ray Liotta. About the Cast: Denzel Washington put his soul onto this role, being by far the best of all! Washington, arguably better here than in recent triumphs like "" Training Day "" (an Oscar - winning role) and "" Antwone Fisher "", goes to an even higher plateau here. Despite a preachy and simplistic screenplay, the intense direction and first - rate performances make this film work."
7170,""" according to the DVD sleeve description. this film demonstrates good photographic and special effects skills, but the visuals are not accompanied by anything too satisfying. Mr. Jasso is the film's "" Best Supporting Actor "" and Ms. Limos is the "" Sexiest Supporting Actress "". By this time, Neil and Judith have discovered how to keep the body from self - destructing and David survives the change. The young cast are mostly vaguely recognizable from bad teen movies and cheesy TV shows and are adequate at best."
4712,"The film must then rely on its central character and set pieces, and the writer / director / lead actress definitely does deliver in this area. She starts cutting herself and keeping pieces of her own flesh in her purse. The film is carried by the lead actress who is always the star despite some good supporting performances. It's sometimes a case of being tricked into believing that you've seen more than you really have but there are also moments that genuinely induce cringing--nails digging into wood comes to mind--and the camera never shies away. France has emerged over the past few years as one of the major forces in modern horror cinema, and while this film can't really be judged on the same terms as some of its fellow gory French horrors; it surely does help to bolster the nation's position at the top of the pile."
3824,"The use of computer generated animation does successfully enhance certain scenes, sometimes so subtly you do nâ€˜t even notice, and sometimes â€“ in the case of Tinkerbell â€˜s magical pixie dust â€“ to spectacular effect. It had better songs, more exciting action, better voice acting, and funnier lost boys. Time â€˜s moved on since the first movie and although Peter Pan never grew up, Wendy did. "" Peter Pan In Return To Never Land "" is Disney â€˜s animated sequel to their truly classic 1953 adaptation of J. M. Barrie â€˜s beloved children â€˜s story. then peter and the lost boys get captured, and Tinkerbell becomes nice."
5880,"It's one of the best horror movies of the 20th century. Even though it was modernized with Carrie making references to the internet, Chris using a cell phone, etc. . Many various and diverse touches were added to make this a very memorable movie. Though looking much more glazed in the eyes than Spacek ever did, Bettis gives a fairly good performance as Carrie; and Clarkson's portrayal of her uprighteous mother is much more low - key, but no less threatening, than Laurie's portrayal. Rena Sofer as Miss Desjarden was a delight to behold."
6965,"33 : 1 as drawn, the colors are bright and clear as is the Dolby 2. In a time where so many storylines are wrapped in neatly tied packages, this is quite a nice thing. Daria had an admirable sense of self that could not be rattled by the conventions of others. The series - ending TV Movie is still up to the standards that made Daria the great show that it was. However, the secondary plots range from intriguing to not very good at all."
4725,"This documentary is better than most hollywood movies out there. To a large extent, the inherent friction between America's central majority and diverse religious minority groups is controlled and channeled by a matrix of Constitutional Law principles. Living in large communities side by side with the "" english "", as they call without distinction all others, their energy, excellent and desired produce and products and reputation for orderly, crime - free lives has insured respect. Not surprisingly, the return rate from Rumspringa back to the church is 90 percent. It is surprising how many similarities and differences there are between Amish teenagers, and the average American teenagers."
4813,"All these are defined, exercised and conflated with one another in terms of space and the intrigue of space with a little more effort in the latter items on the list. The imagery is unparallelled, simply draw - droppingly near perfect scenes, with bold and vibrant use of colour, symbolism and scenery. Zhang Yimou is an extremely talented director in many respects, but perhaps the greatest is his ability to get incredible performances out of his cast. A large part of this is Yimou's use of bold colours to delineate the different sections of the story (The green, the red, the yellow, the blue, the white). Even short individual scenes are memorable due to their sheer awesome display of skill and speed."
4837,"The film has an integrity and a quality of strength that few films ever capture. It is magic to them to be in a new city, where they discover new things every day. Paddy Considine (a Stephen Rea lookalike), Samantha Morton ("" Minority Report ""), Djimon Hounsou ("" Gladiator "") are all exceptional in their roles. They establish a bond that transcends their different backgrounds. Their friendship with Mateo (Hounsou) is both bizarre and heartwarming."
3834,"Even more strange, in some scenes it actually succeeds in that. Kevin Costner and the rest of the cast do a convincing and thoroughly enjoyable job with this unique premise. Although using many clichÃ©s, the plot is romantic and the story is beautiful. Ron Rifkin (Alias) was a great foil to Mr. Costner. it is the viewers imagination that this film is aimed at, and those viewers that don't have one will struggle to appreciate this film."
6418,"And the Muppets are back to zany form with parodies, such as "" Moulin Scrooge "", taking place in their classic Muppet Theater. Kirk R. Thatcher) Kermit is enjoying their Christmas with their usual selection of shows at the Muppet Theatres, but then trouble starts. The acting as always was good, with some wonderful cameos, such as Matthew Lillard, who was just funny. The cast of muppets are very good - with all the new characters from the television show having a bit of time, including Pepe, Risso the Rat, Johnny Fiama and his monkey etc. . The Muppet Movie, The Great Muppet Caper and The Muppets Take Manhattan were good family movies, cleverly written and fun to watch."
3835,"In some scenes, this works adequately, but on the whole, Jessie's motivations, while they are explained, seem kind of empty. ( Another one that is good - looking, ladies . ) Most of the remaining cast were also enjoyable, if not impressive in their performances. Embrace its plot holes and stupid dialog (which lends itself to random quoting), sing along to the entertaining rock songs. Marius (who did not make Lestat btw) in the chronicles is the great reasoner of the Vampires."
4857,"There are many visual gems in this film. There are so many wonderful scenes in this film. Uzak was shown as part of the Rochester Labor Film series. Uzak rings true in so many ways, and that sincerity is probably its greatest accomplishment. Nuri Bilge Ceylan takes his place among the dozen important directors now active."
6494,"You'll definitely love it and it will be the shortest three hours of your life! So if you plan on watching it, make sure you plenty of time on your hands. It was totally free, and he talked for five hours, just like IMDb says he did at Cornell. What comes out of that mouth is some of the funniest and most irreverent talk one has heard in presentations such as these. The guy is genuinely funny and seems ultra kewl."
4933,"The performances are also very good and there aren't really any weak links in this regard. Orly Silbersatz Banai as Dafna, Maya Maron as Maya, and Nitai Gaviratz as Yair deliver, beautifully realistic, heartfelt performances. Nice film overall with good acting performances Orli Zilverschatz - Banay is Dafna the mother, a central tour de force. Good story, thoughtful plot with trying crisis, and heartfelt performances all round."
4934,"An excellent cast turns in credible and moving performances. The three principals (henderson, sives and rawlings) are so utterly convincing and there is so much chemistry between them all. They are backed up by two brilliant turns from Julia Davis as Moira and Mads Mikkelsen as Horst. Shirley Henderson is wonderful, as usual, but there are also strong performances from Jamie Sives and Adrian Rawlins. From good cinematografy and a good script, to a well polished, melancholic score, this film is worth viewing."
4938,"Alfre Woodard deeply reflective, eloquent and mature. It just hit the point that this was such a vanity piece rather than a serious piece of filmmaking, which it really could have been, if someone else had directed it that is. But others provide nuggets of wisdom like Holly Hunter, Diane Lane, Salma Hayek, Martha Plimpton (who has forsaken movies for the stage) and a predictably funny Whoopi Goldberg. As well - intentioned as is Roseanna Arquette, there's no real point to this film. Arquette's earthy style made the documentary flow very smoothly, and it was refreshing to see no pretensions."
5715,"Butchered mother - ghost Kayako is very Sadako - like, crawling around with her long black hair in her face and moving with unearthly jerkiness. Many of the films most frightening sequences feature the murdered woman Kayako: her head full of black hair peeking around a corner, her shadow moving down a corridor and filling a security camera, a head - on shot of her crawling through an attic at night with only the beam of a flashlight illuminating her. It's not great, but it's a decent, straightforward ghost story with more than enough scary moments to please most horror fans. If you are one of those whom this film really gets to, it is an experience as powerful as Ringu, Dark Water or the Exorcist. The first 40 - something minutes are closest to the American remake, but it was surprising that this film is much more linear."
5712,"Having said that, this cynical thirty - something loved it to bits. "" The Cat Returns "" is a beautiful film as one would expect from Studio Ghibli. And an utterly bizarre tale this is, with enough laughs, emotion and poignant moments anyone could want. This is a wonderful fantasy film, cute and funny, and full of remarkable and memorable characters. Ewles is a perfect Baron and his voice is smooth as you can imagine."
5695,"This is a stunning piece of work which wipes the floor with contemporary Hollywood's so - called "" thrillers "". In the case of Sympathy, Ryu was excellent. The cast of SFMV also deserve commendation for their performances, which are all good. Actually, Kim Ki - Duk's movies are probably the closest point of reference, though Park Chan - Wook's film is smarter. The relationships in this film are so pure, so real and beautiful, especially between the little girl and her captures."
5694,"This is filled with great bits of comedy. There is a deep honesty in the performances and throughout the film. The great flick here is Fubar. There are truly funny moments that surprises. Its not the goofiness or the idiocy, its the spirit of these two bozos that wins your heart."
5691,"And there are some funny moments in this one. The Final Verdict: With a couple of decent scenes and ideas thrown in, this is a really hard movie to recommend to anyone. There are a lot of well - intentioned sequels which (by their very nature) cannot string you along with the same' fear of the unknown' in the original, and this is the case here. Cube 2 is in many respects just a clone of the original Cube movie. ( brilliant opening credits though) But Hypercube - although not as good as Cube - does work as' next step' sort of sequel."
5690,"The frank honesty of Sacha Baren Cohen's character and the clever satire enterwine beautifully together. As some comedies are only have one or two comical scenes, this movie was laugh - a-thon. On the whole, Ali G Indahouse is hilarious British comedy at its best - and funniest, and most clever. It is very funny - Its probably not as funny as the TV show or the video as thats where Ali G's stupidity is in its element. The humour is probably very English, and specifically London, so its possible that non-English viewers may not get some of the humour."
5425,"Everything about this work is brilliant and it deserves the widest audience possible. But the movie is very strong on most aspects; the directing is fabulous, both in it's pace and in it's settings, and the acting - Jeremy Irons in particular - is truly exceptional. The scenes of Paris are correctly nostalgic: the sets for' Carmen' by Carlo Centolavigna create a gold standard for all future true productions of' Carmen'. First up is Carmen, and this film - within - a-film (a riot of dancing gypsies, dashing matadors and floating lace mantillas) is easily the highlight of the show. It also enables Zeffirelli to include several spectacular scenes from "" Carmen "" as part of the plot."
5339,"The stylised langauge and the modern visuals work very well. It's colourful and fun (the' footy' match is inspired lunacy). This certainly won't be to everyone's tastes, but it's a good one. The acting is tremendous, the dialogue is delivered with such ease and intensity, and where there is caddiness--it is intentional. This is a masterful adaptation / reformulation of THE REVENGER'S TRAGEDY."
5325,"Improper, almost criminal, activities of the supreme court, Katherine Harris and her entire office, Jeb Bush and his entire office, dozens of congressmen and senators, scores of aides. Greg Palast of the BBC explains his investigative reports (something very few Americans are aware of) very well. Unprecedented â€“ the 2000 presidential elections is a movie all real Americans must watch. To keep the U. S. a democracy, with fair elections, you must see this and show it to friends. It's another Robert Greenwald production, who has been well - known at putting together left leaning documentaries (on subjects such as Walmart and Rupert Murdoch) about important social and political issues."
4975,"The whole film has this brilliant feel - good - movie athmosphere. Carmen Maura is fantastic as usual, and the unknown Julieta Cardinali has a very beautiful participation. Everything he says gives you a smile and a little twist in the heart. Valentin is the Amelie Poulin of the Latin younger set, and just as adorable as Kolya, the Cinema Paradiso kid, and the Life is Beautiful kid. The film is worth seeing because of Rodrigo Noya, the sweet Valentin of the film."
5189,"is the extreme use of colors and vivid scenery. Takeshi Kitano wrote, directed and edited with astonishing beauty and poignancy, way beyond the audience pleasing romp of "" ZatÃ´ichi: The Blind Swordsman . "" The tragic end does follow Kitano's tradition but here at least is some joy in seeing Sawako's memory revived from being brought to the scene of her original wedding engagement with Matsumoto. For the best, one would still have to go back to the likes of David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia. A frequently applied angle in looking at Dolls is its beautiful cinematography, simply in terms of Kitano's desire to show the natural beauty of Japan in the four seasons."
5041,"The performances are so perfectly spot - on that you could swear you know these people--what could have been a string of cliches or platitudes was instead carefully detailed to look like real life. Not like all other school shooting movies like "" Elephant "" or "" Zero day "" this one has a deeper meaning. It is also a genuine drama, and takes no prisoners when it comes to depicting adult hypocrisy and aloofness. And that message is that for kids, high school functions as an emotional and psychological. This wonderful film honestly explores the factors that lead teenagers to become violent."
5059,"There was a stylish approach to this film on the part of director Vincenzo Natali with interesting camera angles and effective close - ups. It was also refreshing to see Jeremy Northam and Lucy Liu given leading roles and expanding their range as performers. He paces the film superbly as well and has given it a great look. Indeed, something clever is going on here, but most alert and intelligent viewers will see each plot twist coming, and will feel (at least through most of the film) that they have seen it all before. The story is of a Morgan Sullivan, who applies for a job with a high - flying techno - company called Digicorp."
5109,"The scenes are tense, the technical side perfect. Though Larry's Clark's movies deal with very explicit, or "" realistic "" subject matter his presentation is overwrought. Depending on who you ask, the scenes in question are "" brutally honest "" or simply "" disgustingly pornographic "". As one who is purported to be a breaker of styles and conventions this movie was shot pretty conventionally with lots of sex. Tate's grandparents may initially come across as whiny and pathetic yet there's a sweet little scene later on that shows their genuine affection for one another."
5112,"Superb performances, a tight script and tense direction make this a winner in every department. The emotions and tension between the four were well - scripted and brilliantly played. The depth of this movie is best served by the understated yet deeply moving performances of the main characters. It has an all star cast in Hong Kong cinema, and of course, the screenplay, the acting, the editing, the camera work and overall directing is flawless judging by all standards. The sequels (2 prequels) will delve deeper into it."
5124,"When smart, idealistic (more often than not, good intentioned as well) individuals share this belief that they stand on a higher moral ground, that they have a greater, grander purpose in their "" calling "", they'd willingly go to any lengths in pursuit of their causes. The Weather Underground presents a well - balanced view of the militant faction of the 1960s anti-war group that orchestrated a series of direct actions (including bombings) in protest of the Vietnam War and American imperialism. The documentary contains interviews with seven of the original Weathermen, all White, middle class, and well educated: Mark Rudd, Bernardine Dohrn, Bill Ayers, Brian Flanagan, Naomi Jaffe, Laura Whitehorn and David Gilbert. Despite these differences, all are given an equal chance to explain their motivations, and that makes it a really fascinating documentary. Perhaps if viewed in tandem with a film that explores the victories that have been made through non-violent protest "" The Weather Underground "" can achieve its best potential."
5129,"Nakata's well known deliberate pacing is perfect here. An unusual item keeps appearing, despite attempts to discard it. Another important symbolic commonality shared by both Ringu and Dark Water is that of claustrophobic spaces. Despite Dark Water's relatively overt similarities to a number of other filmic works, this is one of director Hideo Nakata's most successful films--at least as good as his famed Ringu (1998), if not better. Hope to enjoy more movies like these."
5136,"The story is just so engaging and there are no dull moments at all. But the gags in - between are terrific. It captured everything that had to be captured, every meaningful move and look. By the way - the film often is compared to Dogme95, with good reason. As an aside you get a good look at some aspects of the former East Germany 10 years on, as the story is situated there."
3844,"The movie has a lot of laughs. Some good laughs, some cheesy dialogue. The best thing this film has going for it, is the nice on - screen chemistry between the two leads. Josh has some good chemistry with Shannyn Sossamon who plays Erica. In 2002's '40 Days and 40 Nights', Josh Hartnett's character tries just that."
3845,"But they pretty much get everything right. The wives of the soldiers are believable. If the people who were there say this is a realistic account of events and emotions, then that's the best accolade a film can have. What those emotions may be are as likely to be as highly personal, as the strength of their feeling. He brings all the sustained intensity of BHD in the action sequences, but introduces the NVA perspective, the wives' perspective and a far more charismatic and heroic central figure in Lt. Col. Hal Moore."
8506,"What a wonderful, smooth, beautiful performance Czuchry gives here. If not for anything else watch this for the amazing views shown throughout. SWIMMING UPSTREAM is a beautiful film. Matt Czuchry gives a very memorable, believable and heart wrenching performance as Morris. Kelly Rutherford and Moriarty lighten up the screen with moving performances."
3854,"DVD has an fine commentary track by the director and producer: Matt Alvarez. It's in a four pack that includes all Ice Cube movies, and it stars Mike Epps as well. There are some really hilarious scenes and both Ice T and the con man put in excellent performances. They both have pretty good comedic performances which along side the action directing makes a decent / tolerable action comedy. Directed by the first - time filmmaker: Kevin Bray, who directed plenty of music videos for talented music artists."
3855,"But go with a light heart and an acceptable frame of mind, and keep your expectations below that of a 10 out of 10 film. Mark Addy is limited by the script as Filby; in the 1960 version Alan Young was wonderful in that role. This version of the H. G. Wells classic is quite different from the wonderful 1960 movie starring Rod Taylor. The 2002 version must have H. G Wells turning in his grave : 1. The lower - class evolved into the Morlocks."
3856,"There are lots of characters, but none of them is well developed. Soderbergh has left behind the slickness of Ocean's 11 and Erin Brockovich and made an experimental film that bristles with inventiveness. It is a good resource for actors searching for what truth honestly looks like on screen. A very good and daring idea where all the actors were abandon to their own choices in make up, dressing and craft supplies. Director Steven Soderbergh calls Full Frontal the unofficial sequel to Sex Lies and Videotape, his groundbreaking 1989 film."
3872,"Better than Monsters Inc or Shrek. The overall look of the film is incredible; an intensely coloured, strangely believable fantasyland of snow, geysers, mud, rocks and ice. They are nomads, and that's really refreshing and uplifting to watch. Highly intelligent sabre - tooth tigers want to get revenge for the killing of one of their pack, so plot to steal the baby son of the human tribe leader. The backgrounds have a colorful, clean, streamlined look to them, and the animals themselves, in their appearance and design, provide a witty commentary on evolutionary history."
3873,"It was an engaging story, moved like lightning and had some excellent scares. For the people who have played games, this one gives good vibes and they are going to love it. The film moves at a breakneck pace, with some elaborate sets and great cinematography that sets the dark mood well for this atmospheric sci - fi thriller. It had wonderful action, nice gore and the performances overall were exceedingly decent for what they needed to be for a video game adaptation. She and the others find themselves locked in "" The Hive "", an enormous, elaborate underground structure that was sealed by the supercomputer controlling it."
3874,"Deniro proves he can be a great Straight man again with some hilarious and spontaneous moments. Robert De Niro was on top of his game, delivering his lines with such aplomb, one has to believe this is his everyday demeanor. The saving grace is that De Niro's understated cynicism provides an effective counterpoint to Murphy's over-the-top enthusiasm, resulting in just enough comic tension to wring laughs out of even the weakest of material. Those are by far the funniest scenes. Granted, the film seemed to take on many buddy - film conventions while trying to make fun of the concept, it goes without saying this film was genuinely funny."
3896,"Reapers are blood - feeders, just like vampires, except they feed on humans as well as vampires, effectively making them an enemy of both, and their thirst is much stronger than the traditional vampire. If you like vampire movies, or action packed movies you'll love this one too. What remains is a series of fast and stylish action scenes, held together by a reasonable plot and a nice few little twists and turns to keep it engaging. This scar is where the lower jaw splits open when the Reaper is feeding, creating a frighteningly massive mouth like a vampire version of the Predator, and which has things inside it reminiscent of the horrifying and strangely unique Tremors. There are some types of movies that you walk into expecting a lot of killing, a lot of swearing and snappy dialogue."
3897,"For some good laughs, SORORITY BOYS rates a 6/10. If you want some nice familiar humor that hits all the appropriate notes in the genre (think National Lampoon, or Ryan Reynolds, or Stifler) this is a good bet. While it is definitely not the milestone movie for the 2002 year, it is funny and worth the time (if you like these types of movies). The way that he says that, has to be one of THE funniest spoken lines in film history, it's just the way his mouth opens so wide to say it and. Now the boys are experiencing a whole new life, learning about how badly they've treated women over the years."
3898,"The director, Pete Jones, was blessed with great performances from well known performers like Bonnie Hunt, Aidan Quinn, Kevin Pollak, and Brian Dennehy. "" Stolen Summer "" is the ultimate heart warmer. This film depicts the values and relationships of those types of families very well. While it isn't a GREAT story, and it does have its cliches, it is good enough to hold somebody's attention. However, this screenplay gives these kids some heavy - duty subject matter to explore and their performances are intriguing."
3900,"great acting and lots of fun. The special effects are very reasonable. Looking at Clockstoppers in that light, it is a big success. Glad to see Jonathan Frakes do such a good job and hope he'll come out with more. Anyhow, the movie was actually really cool and had some REALLY cool ideas."
3901,"The always - amusing Vincent Schiavelli makes a few appearances towards the end. Of course the former host wants his job back and sets out to "" get "" Smoochy. It's an energetic, upbeat, fun - filled journey with a ton of laughs. it'll certainly be one of the most sparklingly satires you'll ever see. The leads played their characters to the right tone, and the supports showed off brilliantly."
3902,"Here are just a few of the many glaring errors : 1. They both seem hopelessly unnecessary; otherwise ,' Panic Room' is a first - rate thriller with similarities to several shockers of the early 1990s ,' Unlawful Entry' (1992) being one in particular. etc. etc. please write a better script next time Fincher. Only this time it's Jodie Foster and Kristen Stuart who are home alone when the three goofballs break into their home to steal the millions of dollars hidden in the Panic Room. The film does well in exploring the confines of the house."
3903,"You have to do it sooner than lator. The DVD is very nice, with a great picture and decent use of the 5. There are lots of great performances and likable characters and it's easy to find yourself really pulling for Morris. What's also good about this is that it can be a great movie with no bad language or anything. The baseball scenes are fun, well - filmed, and portrayed excellently."
3911,"The acting is surprisedly well, especially by Caviezel. Caviezel delivered a strong portrayal of an enigmatic character in ` Angel Eyes', so he had some experience with this type of role. 6/10 should have been better, but it's watchable Ashley Judd is a fine dramatic actor, who returns to serious drama after an ill advised detour into romantic comedy (` Someone Like You'). Jim Caviezel rounds out the cast with a strong performance as the accused."
3912,"It definitely lives up to expectations of the previous National Lampoon movies. The part with the dog and the "" eclairs "" is hilarious in itself. It is also better than most of these silly college movies and this one offers something fresh. This unrated DVD has an clean anamorphic Widescreen (1. The two leading male actors, Ryan Reynolds and Kal Penn, are exceptional as usual, and Tara Reid, while she offers her customary wooden non-performance, fills out her role enough not to be painful."
3918,"Samuel L. Jackson was well appointed as Doyle Gipson, and portrays his part well. It also makes for a more powerful effect overall because it is up to the watcher to notice the subtleties. The acting and directing is expertly carried out, with special praise to Ben Affleck as Gavin Banek. Yet the true Changing Lanes was much more subtle and humanistic than it was meant to be. Changing Lanes is much more complex than the trailer leads you to believe."
3920,"This is just a lighthearted, and yes, over-the-top spoof of sorts. but seriously, even with somewhat higher expectations, this one is worth watching. Some very unpredictable predicaments make this laugh out loud! If you keep your expectations low, it's more likely to be positively surprised. But it is a feel good movie with some great scenes."
3923,"You know everything will turn out good so it will make you feel better as well. Vardalos' screenplay (Oscar - nominated) was the catalyst that put the film on the map and kept it there permanently. Corbett's love knows no bounds though as he makes it clear that she is the one he really wants. Toula and Ian are in love, really very much so. It's the magic of the movies."
3933,"They seemed to have the stronger and by far, more interesting scenes. There are interesting turns in "" Numbers "". There's some good camera work in the film's first and last twenty minutes. It's a swell thriller: a reasonably sophisticated plot, with some neat twists and turns, good camera work, and a kind of satisfactory ending. The most interesting thing about "" Numbers "" are Pitt and Gusling."
3934,"Dwayne Johnson plays a natural - born hero called Mathayus It works and The Rock is very cool as said King (or Mathayus) and former Jason victim Kelly Hu is gorgeous as the scantily - clad Cassandra. But it's well made and loads of fun so just go along with it and you'll enjoy. In quality, it fares about as well as the average sword - and - sandal epic. Secondly, wasn't it amazing that there was such a variety of accents in the film."
3938,"Still, it was a pretty good film if you like moral movies. If sentimental schmaltz with few or no laughs is your definition of comedy, then you're in for a treat. Comedy would have been a much better direction for the filmmakers, however aside from a few jokes on the sidelines, the film takes itself very seriously. OK, he was fairly good in "" 15 Minutes "" and quite good in "" Saving Private Ryan, "" but he should try to steer clear of Hollywood. And Tony Shalhoub deserves better as well."
3940,""" The Salton Sea "" is a highly stylized movie in which nearly all elements are executed well. The Salton Sea is an interesting film. One of the greatest things about The Salton Sea is that it unravels in very unexpected ways. It has everything: great acting, great writing, and great directing. From the visuals, to the dialogue, from the acting, to the delivery, The Salton Sea really is a gritty, enjoyable, and somewhat unique piece of work."
3950,"But with so many great films in his oeuvre, one naturally goes into this film with high expectations. As long as you don't proceed with gigantic expectations, you should have a lot of fun. You really ought to see this one if you are in the mood for laughs because it's a thoroughly successful comedy. Overall a fresh screenplay from Woody, with decent direction and good performances. While he's wringing his hands in the doorway, she paces off distances in the apartment, telling him, "" Okay, now you enter through the door and walk four steps."
3951,"Dafoe is wonderfully scary as the man who has succumbed to the power games of the corporate world that drives a decent man mad striving for perfection in himself while trying to hard to please all the wrong people to no avail and then being consumed by guilt that has built over the years of family neglect which finally helps to push him over the edge when an opportunity to make a huge mistake presents itself. In fact, it has to be considered one of the best comic book adaptations ever. The comic turns from J. J. Jameson hit the mark, the snarling facial contortions of Willem Defoe were suitably evil - looking (and the conversation with his mirror - image was a great touch). With $200 million dollars you can buy many state of the art special effects for the director to full around with to his hearts content. Admirers of the comic book tales should have no trouble liking the movie with its amazing CGI effects."
3960,"If you want a cute film, where the losers come out on top, this is a pretty good movie. There are some funny lines, sight gags and slapstick, some cute girls, the bad guys get what's coming to them and the good guys win. This movie is filled with surprizes for movie buffs. Though this movie shared some qualities of your normal teen movie, it had certain aspects to it that made it stand out from all the rest. If you can watch a movie without being hypercritical about how "" bad "" it is, then get this, sit back a have some laughs"
3961,"It lays somewhere between the two and delivers on all fronts. It has so many psychological layers. Biziou's cinematography is great and Kaczmarek's score sets the tone. And in this respect ,' Unfaithful' excells! The film is excellent and Diane is seductive, sexy and downright awesome as the films main focus."
3967,"And, moreover, they succeed on all fronts. Mr. Grant is just perfect for this role. And in their scenes together, Grant and Hoult strike a chord of reality that finally assures the overall success of this film. Rachel Weisz adds beauty to the film as Rachel. The other cast members â€“ Nicholas Hoult, Toni Colette, and Rachel Weisz â€“ are also v. good in their supporting roles and play off each other well."
3968,"Flawless or not, this is still a STAR WARS movie, and for what it is, it's still worth a look. is serviceable at best, as the performers have been put there basically to deliver the stilted dialogue and serve as foreground for the upstaging special effects. How could anyone accept Samuel L. Jackson, one of the most prolific actors in Hollywood, as "" Mace Windu "" and Jimmy Smits, another instantly recognizable household name, as Senator "" Bail Organa "". And it's great to see C - 3PO and R2 - D2 up to their usual banter again (although sometimes some gags occur when not necessary). The charm of Star Wars was gone before Lucas unveiled his uber - deluxe, special treatment of the films for the third time."
3970,"It's a clever and tightly integrated work, a small masterpiece, where dialogue begets more dialogue, wry observations and witticisms proliferate, all of them ultimately spun into a seamless satirical whole. The witty repartee that Wilde's characters engage in, particularly in The Importance of Being Earnest, is hilarious in most performances. Frances O'Connor, Reese Witherspoon and Rupert Everett all were also very good. He was, she said, the sort of person whose lips moved while he watched television. Algy was "" hard up "" true and in need of "" ready money "" but his bills would be paid."
3975,"' Enough' is good entertainment and despite some minor flaws it has plenty of action, thrills and tension. Two thumbs UP for this little lady! In real life situations outside of a movie people always have others that will help you. Final verdict: good for some laughs, but not many. The "" bad guys "" (i. e. men) are 100% evil and unremorseful, and the "" good guys "" (i. e. girls) are perfect and pure in their motivations."
3976,"This film succeeds on several levels of cinematic bravura. Without giving anything away, INSOMNIA is definitely worth it. If that isn't your thing, then the performances of the three main actors are worth the price of a ticket in itself. Three Oscar winners (Pacino, Williams and Hillary Swank) highlight this film and with good reason. Though the original film isn't given as the source material until well into the closing credits, this follows the main thrust of the story closely."
3977,"This is a great movie for kids, and for adults who want a classic hero's journey. The music is fantastic, with songs by Bryan Adams, and music by Hans Zimmer, who also was responsible for the extremely popular music from the 1994 Disney hit, The Lion King. The horses are well designed also, looking like horses, but anthropomorphised enough to give them recognizable emotional responses. The background art and western landscapes are stunning and offer a mix of painted scenes and computer - created scenery, although everything seems computer enhanced in one way or another. Spirit seeks to keep the wilderness pristine, a place apart from the footfall of white men, where foals can be brought up in peace and security."
3981,"It was a gripping page - turner, and a marvelously intricate work, building suspense in layers. One of the best parts of the novel was the realism. The only redeeming qualities to this film were the nice cinematography and the awesome sound when the big bomb went off. Bates makes a nasty villain and Schrieber is good as the mysterious man with a past, Clark. The reason that movies like "" Fail Safe "" and "" Dr. Strangelove "" were so brilliant is because they were gutsy enough to take on the public's fears directly."
3982,"View it with a relaxed and open mind, and enjoy some of the biggest laughs to ever hit the big screen. Malcom D. Lee has made a worthy follow up to The Best Man and Unisversal may have a new franchise on their hands. Fast, funny, and an utterly silly good time, "" Undercover Brother "" is--in the words of its hero--"" Solid . "" Suffers from occasional lapses â€” as most films of this genre do â€” but the cast is clearly having fun and make it worth the viewing experience. An undeniably goofy setup is made worthwhile by a lot of hip, amusing dialogue and clever, innovative sight gags."
3986,"The choreography was very well done and there were some good one - liners contributing to some amusement along the way. It includes many funny scenes and the action is also good. Although having a plot very predictable and full of cliches, this movie is a funny action movie, almost a comedy. There has to be something said for how funny Chris Rock is, regardless of the setting. It needed better, more original & well thought out action scenes, and better humor."
3987,"In charges the other members of the Sisterhood, kidnapping Bullock, and attempting to make things right! These women, who are about as far from perfect as the cottage in Louisiana is from New York, dare to love each other with eyes wide open. Maggie Smith was hilarious as Caro and Ellen Burstyn was outstanding as Vivi Dahlin'. The cast was phenomenal, particularly Sandy Bullock as Siddalee. In one of the film's many poignant moments, Siddalee does a cruel impersonation of her mother."
3988,"The DVD is well made, with an entertaining commentary track and an interesting "" making of "" featurette. Gradually, she finds ways to expand her circle of territory, which mirrors her personal growth. The genres (comedy / drama / thriller) meshed very well together to make a cohesive, entertaining piece. You were able to sympathize with all the characters. The talent gathered here is young and wonderful and the great sound track, mostly from the 80s works extremely well."
3990,"This however is one of the exceptions thankfully and pleasantly. A gamble, as it turns out, that pays off in spades. The viewer knows something is coming, yet the genuine far exhibited by the characters makes those moments so interesting. The fights are fast and very realistic but still entertaining. The implausibilities are kept to a minimum and the realism to as high a level as possible while still being spectacular enough to meet the expectations of the genre."
3991,"Matthew Lillard is brilliant as Shaggy (how is that possible? Matthew Lillard, however, is letter perfect as Shaggy. Matthew Lillard plays Shaggy well and plays off of Scooby - Doo well even though there was nothing there during filming. Sarah Michelle Gellar looks nothing like Daphne in the cartoon, but she is good. Lillard is amazing as Shaggy because he gets his voice to sound like a carbon - copy of the cartoon Shaggy."
3992,"However, some of the scenes are fantastic. This is another of them and with modern technology the viewers get to experience some very realistic action scenes. Enough good "" general "" war movies have been made. If you are a Woo fan or already appreciated the theatrical cut, it may be worth checking out the director's cut. Woo really shows his talent here, with raw yet beautifully shot war action."
3993,"1 sound and a mild bunch of extras. It doesn't but there are some effective moments and performances that keep this from being a total disappointment. Jodie Foster, as the severe teacher, and Vincent D'Onofrio, as Father Casey, magnificently complete this wonderful cast. Emile Hirsch and Jena Malone are marvelous, especially with the very serious sides of their lives, though the lousy parenting is only vaguely shown with shouting. Culkin gave an equally amazing performance in Burr Steer's neurotic and darkly hilarious film debut' Igby Goes Down' which was released the same year as' The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys'."
4001,"This film is good for a few good laughs. It has some fun moments, and it is not that bad movie. While the jokes in the gilm are the same overall the film is good and has a nice message. Ginuwine does a great acting job in his first movie and Mrs. Fox is good as always. Kevin Pollack is a great in the role of Juwanna's manager, the direction is decent, and it is a light - hearted funny movie good for Sunday evening entertainment."
4002,"*** END SPOILERS *** The direction is solid, as is the animation. Not to mention the animation is excellent and the watercolor backgrounds beautiful. And so begins one of the most unusual and creative animated films from the Disney studios. The animation is simply beautiful, with pink fluffy clouds and wonderfully drawn characters. The characters are developed, unlike most Disney classics, and lovable."
4003,"This is one of the best films of the year, and of recent years. There are, of course, numerous references and homages to the work of Stanley Kubrick, which have given a hint of the edge and flair of' Clockwork Orange' or' 2001'. The plastic, chrome and glass sets, objects and architecture all looked clean and functional and the way that they suck the color out of a scene worked well and gave the film a distinctive palette. Minority Report is one of the best and most unique thrillers to be released in years. The final sign that Spielberg is again at his peak lies in the performances."
4004,"The most unforgettable scene comes early in the film when the children are forcibly torn from their mothers. There is some controversy over just how factual the film and its bases are (including the book by the real - life Molly Craig's daughter, Doris Pilkington), and there were some interesting parallels to the situation depicted in the film and behind the scenes facts about star Sampi and director Phillip Noyce. It soars and plays with the emotions, maybe a little too much but when you are dealing with a thousand year old culture that has music as its central universe, then you may be able to understand that the overpowerful music is just an extension of that. Instead the circumstances of the story create the emotion. The stunning Australian landscape is magnificently photographed by Christopher Doyle, and a haunting score by Peter Gabriel translates natural sounds of birds, animals, wind and rain into music that adds a mystical feeling to the journey."
4005,"It's as solid an ensemble piece as one could want, with enough humor, insight and local color to be another enlightening look at American values by an expert chronicler of such things. He keeps things honest and all of his work is based on personal choices. This view of community and change in a small Florida beach community is another incisive look at American standards by a broadminded, experienced filmmaker. Mary Steenburgen, Ralph Waite, Jane Alexander, Bill Cobbs are all perfectly cast for their roles. Ralph Waite ("" The Waltons "") has some nice moments as Alexander's husband and Falco's father, especially in an exchange with young Alex Lewis once he delivers the coffin he made for Alexander's play."
4006,"Arnold didn't accomplish something as monumental as all the others. The powers that be decided that the storyline of the series held a much more interesting premise: searching for Arnold's parents. the movie isn't particularly hilarious, but it does have some amusing moments, and even one or two quite funny parts. If you're a fan of the show or just love animation movies, pick this one out for the kids. this movie is great for anyone with the intelligence to pay attention."
4007,"-- sandler and romance: : pasta and nuclear chunks. Typically Deeds is the last to know and is appalled when he makes the connection. One of the main jokes is Steve Buscemi as' Crazy Eyes ,' and he orders a pizza with French fries and Oreos. Plans are made for Deeds to sell his shares in the company to Cedar and return home $40 billion richer, but he must remain in New York for a few days as all the legal details are worked out. When it is found that he has a living nephew named Longfellow Deeds who runs a pizzeria in New Hampshire, Deeds is contacted and brought to New York City by attorney & businessman Chuck Cedar."
4010,"Pint - size rap music star Lil Bow Wow stars in it where he shows that he can play ball as well as he raps in this youth - oriented comedy about a young boy whose dream comes true in an unexpected way. Extremely funny, lighthearted kids romp with a positive message and enduring theme. The basketball player "" big brother "" Morris Chestnut worked well as a trouble gifted basketball player who reluctantly takes Bow Wow under his wings and albeit predictable softens up in his parental role with the youngster. Bow Wow makes an impressive film debut; parents and children will love Calv's plucky can - do attitude; and the action sequences are given a little more enjoyment due to the presence of real life basketball pros. It is related to Rookie of the Year in so many ways."
4011,"It was definitely one of the wittiest, craziest and the most successful movies of the late 90's. That is, that the sequel has has to be head and shoulders above its predecessor to be considered good at all. But few of these "" been there, done that "" sequels are fun in a different way. Without that aura of cutting edge newness that defined the original, ` Men in Black II' seems like just another loud, over-the-top summertime blockbuster. Although most innovations are of special effects, MIIB provides some new fun moments in a somewhat formula approach."
4012,"The last 20 minutes of the film are delightfully chaotic (so. monkeys), and the whole production oozes cleverness and fun. Created by Craig McCracken in 1998, the show has equal doses of humor, heart, razor - sharp comic timing, kicky visuals, and good old - fashioned anime - style butt kicking. The characters are oddly endearing, and there are many moments of warmth and just feeling good. The plot is fast - paced and funny, with some hilarious pop - culture references that may require a second viewing to fully register (let's just say that Bill Maher and Van Halen are involved, not to mention King Kong)."
4013,"Perhaps Irwin is better in half hour segments. This movie is a nice blend between a Hollywood picture and Steve Irwin's documentaries. Strangely, though, for all the fun and laughs involved here the movie seemed to go on longer than its allotted 90 minutes. You'll hear a lot "" crikey "" and "" ain't it a beauty "" - some of Steves famous one liners - during the movie, in his funny Australian accent. It may sound weak and clichÃ© but it's true; You're way better of watching the Crocodile Hunter series on the Discovery channel with Steve and Terri Irwin."
4014,"Everything about it works: the story, the acting, the sets, the special effects. The script had its moments but the production work and set - design were simply awesome. Everything in this movie was great, and sci - fi fantasy fans, you MUST SEE THIS MOVIE! Both Christian Bale and Matthew McConaughey were believable as care taking heroes. Yes, there were credibility problems with the story but overall, it was good escapist adventure."
4015,"Unlike past years, it deserves it. The production's sets and costumes are just as exemplary; in fact, the entire film is a technical marvel. The atmosphere of the period, all the backgrounds and decorations are perfectly created, editing and cinematography are almost flawless while the story is well written. This is one of the best made movies from 2002. But the most important technical element in the film is Conrad L. Hall's beautiful photography."
4022,"( this may be a first) David Arquette remaining likable, which he always kind of is. David Arquette is perfectly cast as the lead. Finally, the action scenes are exciting, imaginative and very well paced. The film appears to be done in the same style as "" Tremors "" and definitely captures the light heartedness of that film. It takes the old formulas and twists it around to have fun with."
4023,"Everything looks like it is going great. One of the best things about the movie is that the dramatic action is pushed along by genuine concerns. The settings, the story telling, the performances, the direction, the music, the tension, the interaction and chemistry between the characters, the authenticity and best of all the cast truly made this film a "" masterpiece "". Peter Sarsgaard also shows great promise in this early effort of his. One man that the crew looks to and respects."
4024,"The film once again features great colors, a virtual rainbow of them, especially with some of the inventive rooms in the Little house. Highly recommended for the family, and that's no clichÃ©. In the sequel, Stuart Little (voiced by Michael J. Fox) now has a quintessential relationship to his family. More so than in the first one, the picture is kept upbeat by the hilarious presence of Snowbell the cat, voiced by Nathan Lane, who has one terrific one - liner after another. Stuart Little 2 is one of those children's films that appeals to both the children and those who must pay the ticket price."
4025,"And what a great DVD it is. The rest of the DVD â€“ documentaries, scene break downs and music videos are good also and prove how much the medium of DVD can shine when time and effort are taken with it. The best scenes included Dr. Evil's prison rap video, and the suggestive subtitles in Mr. Roboto's office. Myers also cleverly planted some special appearances in that movie, and when he does, they do draw laughs. On top of that, after the almost 15 mins of deleted scenes, is a very funny selection of outtakes, showcasing Myers talents at their best (Dr Evil / Austin Powers) and worse (Fat Bastard / Goldmember)."
4026,"The Kid Stays in the Picture, despite not being as terrific as the filmmakers might think it is by their sleek camera angles and typical interludes of montage, is as close to being as honest as it could be. But, as KID makes abundantly clear, Evans' spectacular if unlikely career path owes far more to the well - established link between the manic depressive temperament and creativity than CARPETBAGGERS - type pulp fiction. Considering the flood of quality documentaries that have been released in the last decade, the general Viewing public deserves something better. His seemingly boundless reserves of energy, when constructively channelled, can create works of cinematic art; when employed in less salubrious ways, the self - destructive results usually end up in the National Enquirer. Directors Brett Morgan and Nanette Burstein obviously pored through a wealth of material on the subject, culling from it a comprehensive, streamlined and fast - moving narrative that grips the audience with its humor, its sadness and its tribute to the indomitableness of the human spirit."
4031,"This film is a fast - paced kid's movie and there's only one reason to see it: Dana Carvey. Here's hoping that Dana Carvey will strike creative gold in the near future. After two viewings over the weekend, the kids were quite solemnly quoting lines and then laughing. In addition to the celebrity walk - ons (Bo Derek, Jesse Ventura, Paula Abdul, among others), Harold Gould, James Brolin, Jennifer Espinoto, Brent Spiner and Edie McClurg are all good sports who deserve better material than what they have been handed here. Dana Carvey is an extremely talented comedian, which makes it a shame that his efforts since his Saturday Night Live days have fallen, at least for the most part, miserably flat."
4032,"Well, "" Signs "" is extremely well - shot, with production design and camera work combining seamlessly to evoke a sense of atmosphere and growing panic - hats off to Tak Fujimoto. Most of all, Shyamalan is an expert craftsman and knows how to get the most out of space, actors and sound. And the top price goes to: j) Alien communication can best be observed on baby monitors! Like some of the best monster / alien movies, the creature (s) are only revealed a tiny bit at a time â€“ and old (but good) tricks are used to keep the suspense high. the human body consists 90 +% of water, which the aliens cannot handle."
4034,"Engaging sequel is far less cheesy than its predecessor, has a much better story, and lots of imaginative visual effects accompanied by exciting, cliffhanger action scenes. He envisions scenes and marshals everything to pull them off with resources at hand. Along with that were some pretty imaginative sequences embedded as preteen fantasies. A great movie for adults and kids. ( spoilers) Spy Kids was simply a treat."
4035,"One of the better dramedies of the year. Jennifer Aniston proves that she is an excellent actress, able to conduct and carry out a dense movie. She is really acting and it is one of the best performances of 2002. Anniston, who is probably in every scene in the film, carries the picture with her rich and highly empathetic performance. Jennifer Anniston gives a beautiful, heartfelt performance in ` The Good Girl ,' a film totally in tune with the rhythms of everyday life."
4036,"Clintwood is supported by a brilliant cast that includes the fabulous Anjelica Huston, the elegant Wanda de Jesus, the charming Tina Lifford and the funny Jeff Daniels. With all this said, "" Blood Work "" does do enough good things to keep the audience watching and intrigued --- most of the time anyway. So, if you decide to see this latest installment in the sprawling career of Clint Eastwood, keep in mind that it has all the style, music, and nostalgia even in donuts that it had back in the day 30 years ago. Recommended for more mature couch potatoes into murder mysteries. Clintwood's' Blood Work' may not be the best nor most stylish of its genre but it remains enjoyable for the most part mainly because of the cast."
4037,"It's so much garbage, but it has its moments and Diesel still is a likable hero of sorts. Crazy, mind - blowing, awesome (and in some cases, of course, obviously impossible) extreme stunts! In other words, nothing to detract from the great fun of a fast - paced, amazing stunt-fest that is light, refreshing, and visually awesome. - Thomas Nielsen p. s. Samuel L. Jackson should really not have been here. Invite your friends over, have a few beers, and enjoy!"
4038,"The concert scenes are spectacularly energetic, the sets (especially the Hacienda) are ripped right out of the time period. The scenes of drugs - and - sex - excess on the Monday's tour bus and the re-creation of the Hacienda club nights are superbly portrayed. Danny Cunningham is fine as Sean Ryder, who still survives, despite his best endeavours. So, along with him, and the music, and the strange form of putting together a dramatized, documentary / musical / black comedy by director Michael Winterbottom and writer Frank Cottrell Boyce, it all gels. There are some brilliant acting performances, punctuated by cameos from real members of the Manchester music scene (such as Howard Devoto and Mark E. Smith)."
4045,"Notice in particular the cool looking vehicles. There is simply a lot of good talent in this film, Rosario Dawson, Joe Joe Pantoliano, Jay Mohr, and Luiz Guzman. Underwood has an impressive list of works including "" City Slickers "" and "" Mighty Joe Young "". Eddie Murphy does an OK job, but its clear his best part is as a character actor, or someone a little more interesting (like Jay Mohr's character). Murphy, Dawson and Quaid are all great in their roles, and supporting characters are played very well by some big names, such as Peter Boyle, Pam Greir, Burt Young and even a cameo by Alec Baldwin."
4046,"They all look smart in bathing suits --- the words "" woo hoo "" come to mind --- and they're fairly natural. However, there is one thing that moves it from the "" ordinary "" to "" outstanding - the cimematography and the sound. This is definitely a good DVD to have for demonstrating the quality of your digital 5. Plus the dialouge sounded way forced and awkward, and, at times, very unnatural. Seeing the waves crashing fifteen feet tall, it is definitely worth seeing in theaters to get the full effect."
4048,"From the moment she appears on screen, Gwyneth Paltrow is a commanding presence. The dialogue in these encounters is often sharp, intelligent, incisive. ` Possession' is an excursion into new territory for LaBute, and the result is a memorable, transfixing experience for his audience. Beyond all of which, Paltrow has eyes that draw you in like tractor beams. First and foremost, this is an enthralling love story, made all the more so by LaBute's sensitive and sensible presentation."
4049,"This makes it above the rest of this genre by a good head and shoulders. The colors in here are astounding at times and the camera - work innovative with some neat angles. That's exactly what One hour photo is, a good script with brilliant performances. But, in the end, it's a one man show that belongs to Mr. Williams. The brilliant use of stark colors fleshed out the film, and those that garner enjoyment from the sets and cinematography, as well as the dialogue, will be pleased."
4050,The cult of celebrity is brilliantly examined in Andrew Niccol's ` Simone. Made up from parts of the very best that Hollywood has to offer she is breathtakingly beautiful. SIMONE is a beautiful actress that is made up of pixels. It's amazing that today's superstars don't immolate under the spotlight's glare. Taransky's invented discovery successfully brings a few of his most cherished cinematic visions to the screen and eventually overshadows him completely.
4051,"Very good fight scenes and you almost feel the sweat. Snipes matches him on this level by producing a simple performance but adding an impressive physical presence to the proceedings. Rhames also looks very impressive and fearsome. In the world of rank boxing, there are many notable fights which can be measured on one hand. The cast do a lot to help the impression of substance by providing lots of faces who put in effort."
4061,"Maniacal laughter, bug - eyed expressions of madness, flashing lights, tilted camera angles. The movie resembles a little diddy of a film titled "" Ringu / The Ring "" an awful lot, though both of those renditions are spectacular and this pales entirely in comparison, and even though there are some nice settings in this movie, that is really and truly the only plus side to it. FeardotCom may very well be the worst of those films. But, when the plot of a film is neither logical nor entertaining you get one movie: FeardotCom ( Cinenygma) - One of the executive producers, who introduced the film, said it wasn't 100% finished yet, and that even the title might change."
4062,"best of luck to Treach in his ensuing acting career. Having enough of his twisted game Damien calls off the hit, but Treach has other plans. In one particularly brutal fight, Treach drives an iron spike clean through the shaved head of one of his former buddies. Along with them being impressive physical specimens, they each have their own trademark kill techniques. In a series of graphic sex scenes (including a full frontal view of Treach's impressive manhood) the romance gets red hot and it's only a matter of time before Damien lets Treach know that love isn't healthy in his line of work."
4065,"And Shiri is doing good on her carrer. She knows everything, she can go anywhere. Good performances really make the film work. If the script is weak, the acting is generally pretty good, with reasonably effective performances from Jesse Bradford, Erika Christensen, and James DeBello as Dante. The character Madison is interesting but when the story comes to the end, everything turned so quick and seems to get more and more nonsense."
4068,"The timing in various scenes were impeccable. Terence Blanchard does an admirable job supporting the scenes with his score. one of the few comedies with a meaning to it, and a good one. , Gabby (Jasmine Randle), Billy (Lahmard J. Tate) and JD was wonderfully choreographed. Great stories being told by Mark Brown, Don D. Scott, Marshall Todd and with Tim Story's direction."
4069,"And in its brief 82 minutes, it works. Dennis Farrina as Lee's boss and soon to be father in law gives a great performance in this as he tries to catch Lee at anything and everything. There are some truly funny moments in this film (especially the ones with the widower) and it is quite amusing for a good laugh. 2002 has seen some pretty horrid films. The part where John and Mr. Warner end up in drag at the judge's house was so funny."
4070,"All in all , 90 minutes of sheer enjoyment. But the choreography is excellent and the action scenes are great. The action scenes are performed to flamboyant ans stylized you have to suspend belief. But despite it's old - skool approach and dodgy acting, this is still an enjoyable romp through the sunnier parts of southern France. The fighting scenes are cool and the beginning and ending sequences are a blast."
4072,"The key women, Sarandon, Peet and Danes all play fully formed characters. One of the greats, with memorable characters you'll think about for days. Performances are uniformly excellent, the story involving, and the themes well explored. The acting, the characters, the plot and the visual story were all so refined. The Igby soundtrack is tres alt moderne and every cut is great."
4086,"So that's 15 seconds worth watching out of a movie that lasts 90 minutes or so. It may well be "" a bullet - ballet of action "" (according to the box) but "" Ballistic: Ecks Vs Sever "" is a shockingly bad admission to the overcrowded action genre. But as the body count rises and the explosive set pieces get ever noisier, they realise they must work together to defeat the sinister Robert Gant (Gregg Henry) who has played both off against each other. The film's third - rate espionage plot makes no sense at all and serves basically as a lame excuse for endless explosions, shootouts and double - flipping car chases, which have become the standard accoutrements for virtually every action picture since ` Bullitt' in 1968. The only two things "" Ballistic "" had going for it were the presence of some rarely - seen hardware (fun for you firearms buffs) and some spectacular action sequences (though these were plagued by some annoying clichÃ©s, such as a protective vest preventing all injury to a character, and henchmen showing complete disregard for personal safety), and these were simply not enough to save this turkey."
4087,"The film, for all the redcoats and' jolly good old boy' accents NEVER invokes the Victorian era in manners or morals. Anyone who appreciates the ever increasing rarity of good movies made from good stories should see this film. SOME SPOILERS BELOW The history behind this director's chosen period - the first Gordon relief expedition - certainly has more than enough adventure and drama to it, particularly when one considers that not only does Newbolt immortalize it in Vitai Lampada but so does Kipling with his' Fuzzy Wuzzy' who, indeed, did nearly break the legendary British squares at the battles of Abu Klea and Tamai. Along with his friends, he is among the top officers being shipped to the Sudan where rebellion has broken out. This is one of the best of this year in terms of mainstream film."
4088,"Stuart Townsend and Courtney Love aren't as effective as Theron and Bacon, but come through with solid performances. Otherwise, if they had stuck to the basic plot, this could have been a nice little thriller, especially because on average, the acting was pretty good (especially Charlize Theron and Kevin Bacon). What begins as a stylish thriller with good psychodramatic potential abandons the mind games at the half way point, trades nuances for sledge hammer blows, and disintegrates in a ball of Hollywoodish convoluted anything - for - the - thrill fire. This sort of starts off as a typical Hollywood blockbuster and it certainly ends like one but the story and the way it unfolds is very good. and three different storylines interwoven by the writer quite nicely."
4090,"Those Gyllenhalls, they sure can act. As Lee and Grey, Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader turn in terrific performances. Maggie Gyllenhaal is outstanding in a potential minefield of a role - she handles it with dignity and even provides some effective dark humour. Recently there's been quite a few -' May' ,' Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance' and' Auto Focus' immediately spring to mind. Maggie, like her brother Jake, turns in great performances like they're routine - she makes it look easy."
4092,"Inflammatory, but extremely thought - provoking ,' The Trials of Henry Kissinger' is a film that should be viewed. The Arthasastra of Kautilya (3rd century B. C.) mentions amongst various tradesmen and technocrats the Saubhikas as' pilots conducting vehicles in the sky'. Narrated by actor Brian Cox, the documentary is presented in lively "" 60 Minutes "" fashion using archival footage, background music, and a combination of interviews with Kissinger associates and journalists such as Seymour Hersh, William Safire, and Hitchens himself. ' The Trials of Henry Kissinger', directed by Eugene Jarecki and written by Alex Gibney (adapted from Christopher Hitchens' book) is definitely a film that, if it were actually given a wide enough audience, would provoke some fairly strong reactions. The Trials of Henry Kissinger is timely and the idea that statesman should be held accountable for their actions under International Law is a compelling issue that deserves to be debated in public forums."
4093,"It is so fun, so full of genial and amusing characters, excellent acting and an excellent ending. This is a fine, funny movie that relies more on an ensemble cast than just on Reese Witherspoon. Reese Witherspoon has good chemistry with both Patrick Dempsey and Josh Lucas. "" Sweet Home Alabama "" - a fine movie for those who enjoy a good comedy, and especially those who like Reese Witherspoon. The first and last scenes complement each other very well."
4094,"The special effects come off dazzling and flawless! It's certainly a fast - moving 99 minutes and there's nothing wrong with that. To the extent that they succeed as stars, they build constraints. Lets hope shanghai knights and highbinders are better. Jackie is an amazing man, with the stunts he can do at his age."
3794,"AWTR succeeds in delivering a great experience. And bring tissues - this one is a real tearjerker which leaves you feeling uplifted and optimistic. Otherwise, the acting done by Mandy Moore and Shane West is superb and top notch - these two actors have quite the career ahead of them. But due to his community service responsibilities he really gets to know her. You have to give a lot of credit to the young main actors in the film (Mandy Moore and Shane West) they did a great job for both of them just starting their movie careers only a couple of years ago."
4096,"A true indie with great performances! Gyllenhaal, Sarandon, Hoffman and even new - comer Pompeo are absolutely magnificent. Little things drive the film and the characters in the film begin to appreciate the smaller things in life. Dabney Coleman in a small role was wonderful. He has one brilliant scene however, and this one is not the one in the courtroom that some reviewers loved."
4097,"The musical numbers are fun and provocative. This is a fine and funny film for kids of all ages (Including 38). Random side comments from characters for laughs are all fine and well, but they shouldn't distract from the flow of the movie. Even the Veggie children learn of such themes, one meaning to respect your companions, the other meaning to give others second chances even if they don't deserve them. From the opening car trip sing - a-long to the closing credits, the high standard of Veggie insanity is maintained."
4098,And the opening 5 minutes is magnificent. They seem more realistic than they were in Manhunter. Lecter was in it just enough to keep it constantly fresh and on edge. The acting performances are first - rate. Dolarhyde takes it over the edge and Graham brings it subtly back.
4099,"This movie is a very realistic depiction of the defining moment of the "" troubles "" in Northern Ireland. It is worth noting that this is based on the Irish Governments review of the Widgery report into Bloody Sunday. However, the documentary style film - making style means that factual omissions and implications have greater impact than in a film that does nt purport to be' historical fact'. As many of the previous commenters have pointed out, this is a very exciting and well acted film about a shameful day in British history. Cities are complicated social ecologies, and the film shows a great diversity of attitudes and pressures on all sides, managing to be both clinical in meticulous detail and visceral in shocking impact."
4100,"Ribisi is very good and Blanchett is great. As someone who just loves great visuals, this is an astonishing piece of work - just magnificent to view. The direction and cinematography are both remarkable, the story utterly compelling, and the performances--especially Cate's--beyond compare. And, as is usually the case, a fine performance by Giovanni Ribisi [her co-star in another movie, The Gift]. It enlivens the senses, touches the heart, and moves you with little dialog."
4112,"A good number of these have been done over the years, certainly, and so the subject matter is familiar, but the story details / mechanics of "" Below "" present it all in a fresh manner. Pretty good acting from a diverse cast that includes: Bruce Greenwood, Matt Davis, Olivia Williams, Scott Foley and Holt McCallany. A few charred or bloody corpses are shown to' enhance the mood' as it were. If you have seen your share of genre - movies, there will in this movie rarely be an idea that you have not seen, a cut that has not been there already or a character that is completely new - but it Â´s the mix that counts and this mix came out very right. Below was written by Lucas Sussman, Darren Aronofsky and the film's director, David N. Twohy; Aronofsky is the smart filmmaker behind the art - house hit Requiem for a Dream, and Twohy has consistently specialized in sophisticated "" B "" pictures like The Arrival and Pitch Black."
4113,"Also, the casting choices are superb in every instance. Roger Avary has made "" The Rules of Attraction "" a very highly stylized film. All of stylistic tricks, while technically impressive, also add a lot to the overall theme of the film. Avary deploys his camera very cleverly in this scene, and it never appears too graphic. His scenes are easily the funniest in the movie."
4114,"Nearly everything in this film is just right. ( Sorry, no spoilers) It was a good change. They are sweet together, have some nice scenes. It has strong aesthetic value through it's good looking images / scenery, too. TUCK EVERLASTING deserves to be a huge success."
4115,"The performances here are top notch. Stunning performances by Michelle Pfeiffer and Alison Lohman give the film its power. Pfeiffer is as cool and controlling as she is stunning even in prison garb, and her mastery of personality subtleties deserves acclaim. Robin Penn, Renee' Zellwegger, Michelle Pfieffer; all did outstanding! Patrick Fugit ("" Almost Famous "") offers a nice turn as the one who provides the out for Astrid."
4116,"This is being recognized in all sorts of ways, first of all with the special jury prize at Cannes. an incredibly overrated director who combines the crude rhetorical style of conservative media hacks like ann coulter with the nutty politics and unconvincing "" millionaire spokesman for the common man "" persona of ralph nader. Riveting, chilling, hilarious and absolutely incredible movie despite what your views are on the gun issue. By far the most insightful comments in the film are made by Marilyn Manson - namely that there are certain businesses and politicians in the United States that capitalise on on fear. Not a love of violent movies, video games, and so forth, because other countries love all that too."
4117,"He is self - assured and confident - no surprises there - and is always in control. You can see this whenever someone talks during one of Orny's shows. Jerry did, and that is why his shows seemed to always be better received. It was literally packed with extras that only helped build more excitement for this film. The picture documents this process carefully and gives good insights for performers in all genre."
4119,"The content is pure P. T. Anderson. Until Adam's life begins to flourish: then you get pretty sounds, pretty colors--as the viewer, you're let off the hook, too. He has written and directed a couple of gems. The always - great Luis Guzman is Sandler's well - wishing co-worker, Lance, who is constantly supportive of Barry despite his doubts about what is really going on inside his boss's head. The deal is getting free frequent - flyer miles due to a deal the company has on all of their items."
4120,"After nearly 20 years of trying to become a respected actress (or "" octress "" as she might have pronounced it in "" The Next Best Thing ""), she still can't get out of herself long enough to turn in a performance that anyone with taste could even call decent. In this film, while the sets are beautiful, you may want to mute the dialog. The "" funny "" scenes were merely embarrassing. For years Madonna has tried to prove not only herself, but the public eye, that she can act. Hers is a performance more suited to acting styles of the late 20s, early 30s where posturing compensated as acting a part or an emotion."
4121,"Katie Holmes has a look of pure innocence but she carries herself with a sex appeal beyond her years. This film is much better than the reviews indicate but one has to deal with a subtle conclusion. The performances, cinematography, and music are all great but it just can't seem to find a solid direction. A rich bohemian artist - type, the charismatic Mr. Hunnam disappeared two years ago. Understandably a little stressed, Ms. Holmes has occasional flashbacks about beautiful blond ex-boyfriend Charlie Hunnam (as Embry Larkin)."
4123,"Gore Verbinski's style is unmistakable. Much of the story is told with the camera and most of the stories best moments come from effective use of visuals. The visual aspects of the film are close to perfect, a delightful blend of colour that looks digitally graded as opposed to filtered. It is well - crafted and set with clockwork precision for the schedule of spooky moments. Ringu is a well respected horror movie."
4124,"Kinnear and Dafoe's performances alone are worth the price of admission. The effect is one of the most genuinely creepy performances ever committed to film. Greg Kinnear's Bob Crane joins the likes of DeNiro's Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull, Gene Hackman's Harry Caul in The Conversation, and Nick Nolte's Wade Whitehouse in another Schrader masterpiece, Affliction. And then, in an extraordinary scene, they watch another one of their tapes. A simple message, but Auto Focus takes 105 minutes to get it across."
4126,"Koyaanisqatsi was brilliant, Powaqatsi was quite good, Naqoyqatsi is the same thing all over again, without the beauty and profundity. Rarely has a film so spectacularly failed to live up to its predecessors and lost its way. Enhanced by the haunting music of Philip Glass, ` Naqoyqatsi' offers a dazzling kaleidoscopic view of the world, a visual tour de force for the aesthetically inclined. When representing "" sport as war "" the prominent team logos ensured that the USA was depicted as the winner. The gallery of faces (waxworks) gave only a nod to the existence of important personages outside of the USA."
4127,"Real Women Have Curves is a very enjoyable film, and also a very real film. This is what Robert Ebert from the Chicago Tribune calls "" enormously entertaining for moviegoers of any age . "" Ana matures as the story progresses and the relationships between the family members and among the dress factory workers deepen beautifully. Within the context of the film the answers to those questions are yes, and yes which may be one of the reasons this film is so enjoyable. Funny, poignant and ultimately a triumph in full - bodied (no pun intended) protagonists without compromising it's clear headed vision of how society and culture myopically decides what is pleasant to the eye (or acceptable for that matter)."
4128,"What's most remarkable is how much of a participant the camera itself is in the proceedings. Visually, the film is stunning, with exquisite costumes and furnishings as far as the eye can see. The preparation for this unforgettable night took almost four years. Not content to stand idly by and observe the scene like some passive onlooker, the camera moves right into the center of the action, gliding in and out of the crowds with utmost grace and precision. It's truly amazing to see just how beautifully planned and flawlessly executed the final product turns out to be, especially the ball sequence at the end which features hundreds of dancers and spectators who are set in beautifully choreographed and constantly whirling motion."
4188,"All in all it shines for its small town values, it's heart, and good performances. The acting, particularly by the 3 leads, was good for the most part. Even the many colourful characters, including bit - parts, are very believable in today's small - town culture. It was great to see so many familiar faces from the vast amount of Canadian talent there is out there. Better yet, it was nice to see Leslie Nielson actually act in a movie with a character who had depth instead of his normal two dimensional slapstick characters."
4165,"Desmond Harrington also has a few good moments. As far as the cast is concerned, there are two surprises. This movie is not in the same level of ` The Others', ` The Shining' or ` The Sixth Sense', but is also good film. It wasn't brilliant, but the special effects were beautiful and the sets were magnificent. The screenplay play has some clichÃ©s and is predictable, but the cast, direction and special effects work well."
4166,"Not for the tasteful and high faluting type. Some funny scenes, gross - out scenes, and some that are just. This film is definitely going to gross - out certain people, and enthuse the more wacky crowds out there. While many will attribute this as a factor to the continuing downfall of society, at least it was damn funny (even with multiple viewings). Some of the ` stunts' are clever and amusing, and there is a certain anarchic kick to be derived from seeing these guys pushing back the boundaries of conventional common sense and good taste."
4167,"And the final big thing missing is the element of wonderful surprise Donen crafted so well. Although this new version shares the basic plot premise of the original, it has completely eliminated most of the elements that made ` Charade' such a world - class, timeless charmer. Enhanced by the dashing beauty and charisma of its two stars, Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant, the sophisticated wit of its ingenious script, the shimmering beauty of its on - location photography, and, of course, the classic strains of its Henry Mancini score, "" Charade "" is a movie that one can enjoy no matter how many times one has seen it. And the moment when the original film reveals the big secret is still thrilling, even after watching it a dozen times. Yes, Ms. Newton has a certain attractiveness and appeal at times, but her one - note expression of pouting bemusement does grow tiresome after awhile."
4168,"All or Nothing is extremely successful at conveying all of these aspects. In achieving this, Leigh has the assistance of another of the U. K.'s finest - Timothy Spall. Even the dialogues in the taxi are splendid! His bleakest since Naked but perhaps better realised and more coherent. Leigh has always shown that no matter how dire the circumstances, how forlorn the existence, love and hope, friendship and family, will find a way to offer support, comfort and succor."
4169,"In a motion picture that sweeps from the late 1920s into the 1950s, Julie Taymor proves to be a director of taste and sensitivity. Julie Taymor infuses it with elements of Frida's artistic creativity, bringing much of her work to life. The film was perfectly directed by Julie Taymor and includes magnificent cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto as when imaginatively brings to life the scenes on the Kalho's paintings, where the color is glimmer and spellbound. Hayek perfectly holds the balance between triumphs and losses, joy and sorrow, madness and daily routine, life and death. "" Frida "" is saved from mediocrity by the wonderful performances of Selma Hayek and Alfred Molina, and by its imaginative cinematography."
4170,"Mr. Scott gets better with every new screen appearance. This first film of director Dylan Kidd is a smart and entertaining tentative for a male version of' Sex in the City'. As Roger, Campbell Scott does a superb job bringing out both of those seemingly contradictory qualities. ` Roger Dodger' is not only an intriguing, amusing and poignant tale of realtionships and sex in the modern world, but a confident first film that augurs well for its gifted young maker. Their two targets, Andrea (Elizabeth Berkley) and Sophie (Jennifer Beals) are terrific."
4175,"Speaking of Famke, Famke, Famke, what the hell were you thinking? Updates can work, (Scooby - Doo, Addams Family, Bradey Bunch) but there has to be SOME respect for the source material, even if it's parody. If you can with - hold your disbelief of this concept for ninety minutes his performance is fairly enjoyable. Every ten years or so, a comedy comes along that redefines Movie Comedy. No brilliant ideas, or anything like that, just the usual comic stuff."
4177,"When Laurie returns to France, her past haunts her. DePalma uses many overhead shots to allow the viewer to get full view of certain scenes. De Palma does it in a terrific way with a lot of love for the movies. You really have to admire Brian DePalma as a director. There are intensely mature scenes involving more explicit sexual innuendo, as well as sophisticated cinematic photography that plays with color, shadow and texture."
4178,"If you ever had any doubts about Eminmems talents - one way or the other - you definitely know his worth now! Eminem does have an authenticity about him that makes for a strong presence on screen. The final battles in the movie, are the absolute climax. In an industry where pop music movies are a dime a dozen, this is particularly impressive. In this movie Eminem carries the expression of sheer imminence, raw potential, to a new level of clarity and confidence."
4179,"The 50's feel is bang on and very well done. DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1. Moore, Quaid, and Haysbert give fantastic performances. Excellent production designs, lush cinematography and an beautiful music score are the highlight of this film. The Whitakers are the model of a perfect' 50's family."
4180,"The only surprising twist in this movie is that they don't do the politically correct thing and have Jeffy come in and save the day. He was happy to have Seagal and Ja - Rule signed on, so everything else became second fiddle. It was just a bonus watching Jeffy get is * ss kicked, and fun hoping one of those kicks actually landed. There are several good fight scenes and plenty of action. Hey, Half Past Dead isn't Oscar material, but if you're looking for a fun action movie it's pretty darn good."
4181,"In a word, the performances are "" marvelous . "" So, after "" philosophers stone "" he delivered again! The Whomping Willow, the flying car, the duel between Draco and Harry - every scene was a joy to behold. The great find of the movie is Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy. Definitely entertaining for all ages with no worries about language."
4190,"It's not for everyone and you will get intense critics decided on how people should or would react when millions disappear. Christians of other ethnicities, let alone nationalities, are pretty well ignored. The performances are far more emotional and dramatic, and it will really tug your heart strings. Acting and dialogue are unintentionally hilarious, setting off streams and fits of laughter. But this attempt to mix sermon and action - movie conventions panders so much to its audience--there are token minority characters, but the principals are thoroughly WASPy - - that genuine evangelical intent is hard to swallow."
4182,"The outcome in "" The Crime of Padre Amaro "" is shocking in more ways than one and well worth contemplating for a long time. Unfortunately, his happily deluded demeanor meets with an equally intense personality in the form of Amelia, a devout young devotee acted with mesmerizing perfection by the gorgeous Ana Claudia Talancon. If you read this novel today, besides being marveled by its iconoclast wit, powerful story - telling, sharply drawn multi-layered characters and magnificent style, you will no doubt be startled by EÃ§a's volcanic attacks on the Catholic clergy's corrupt morals and behavior in late 1800s Portugal. The acting of all performers is sober and efficient with special prominence to Ana Claudia in the role of the sensual nymphet who seduces the young priest not with great difficulty it must be said. At the heart of the story is a young priest who wrestles in a major way with the tempting hungers of his body and the grace - filled yearnings of his spirit."
4183,"This, although quite obviously a mockumentry, (It must hard to try and convince people it's real when it's not released in theatres. To make something fake not only seem believable through the characters and the acting, but also through the plot while at the same time making it interesting, is a hard thing to do. The film started out well and the performances were good - Raymond J. Barry was particularly well - suited to his role. Interview With the Assign, although clearly distinguishable as a mockumentry as apposed to a documentary from the very beginning, accomplishes this. A good mockumentry is a hard thing to pull off."
4184,"So if you want to learn who created those sounds in the first place, you must see STANDING. But the performances of those great songs. A few of the other new performances are not quite as strong as this, but overall the music is just great. Amazingly, most recordings were done in one or two takes; a testament to the talent portrayed in this movie. Unlike many "" true story "" documentaries this was a good story with a happy ending."
4191,"The scenes in this film were well filmed and the location was absolutely breath taking. Saying that, the reactions and lines from the characters are all pretty much realistic. The gore is truly realistic and looks painful at times, similar to some of the scenes at the start of Private Ryan. It has some excellent acting, character development and if you see this keep your eye on Pvt. Spooner! The action just keeps on coming with very few breaks, the Werewolves are unstoppable."
4210,"Here the familiar is everything - in fact its the building blocks of the story (such as it is) and the characters and, well everything really. Of course it has its shortcomings (the CG was weak in parts) but it has everything that makes the franchise successful. At moments there is potential for one of the greatest Bond adventures. This franchise of movies has evolved over the years from a cool and clever spy series to an over-the-top slam bang action series. It is joyful to catch homage moments in respect to the previous Bond movies like the conspiracy plot at the presidential suite in the Hong Kong hotel with the Chinese masseuse beauty, and Halle Berry's first appearance moment where she wore an orange bikini with a white belt attached to an army knife."
4211,"Mr Hundert's dedication and enormous enthusiasm is infectiously touching. Compelling glimpses of two of these student's offspring, Robert Bell and Martin Blythe IV, prove to be incredibly revealing. William Hundert is the most highly respected faculty member at St. Benedict's Academy. In some respects, this actually makes him a much more three dimensional, realistic, and compelling character than such previous exemplary teachers as Mr. Chips (Good Bye, Mr. Chips), Mr. Keating (Dead Poets Society), and Mr. Holland (Mr. Holland's Opus). He is able to bring the history of the ancient Greeks and Romans to vivid life for his admittedly highly motivated young charges."
4212,"Next Friday was, well, OK, but it wasn't great. Ice Cube did a great job with these stories and made it a Lord of the Rings of the hood type of trilogy. Friday After Next was maybe a little lower on the scale. The third movie in Ice Cube's "" Friday "" series, this was the funniest of the three so far. As they adjust to their new job, Craig becomes interested in the sexy Donna (K. D. Aubert) who works at her pimped - out boyfriend's department store."
4213,", a movie that stimulates thought is a true breat of fresh air. Kyra Sedgwick is completely believable as Delia and delivers one of the best performances of her career. The use of digital video suits the subject - matter (Dogma 95 on the Hudson) and the whole thing is competently realised. There's a certain elegance in the way she treats her characters, always respectful, yet incisive. Each story creates a vivid picture of something you can hardly avoid calling ` life' as risky and malleable, dangerous but full of exciting highs and lows."
4214,"The colors in this film are very pretty, interiors and exteriors. Both Caine and Fraser bring a quiet intensity to their scenes together. And the direction of Phillip Noyce is magnificent, presenting the story in right doses of romance, drama, action and special effects. She seems far more comfortable and believable in her scenes with Caine, despite their major age difference. The sultry and grasping humidity of the land almost comes off the screen."
4215,"This movie was beautifully animated and had pretty funny scenes. But watching deer defecate (does this count as a spoiler! There were one or two funny moments, one song near the end was amusing, but this still genuinely ranks as one of the worst movies of all time. Like any number of Sandler movies (with the possible exception of "" The Water Boy "" and "" The Wedding Singer ""), intelligent dialogue is substituted with maniacal outbursts and acts of bizarre violence, while comedy is replaced with vulgarities and just plain stupidity. Even a lot of Sandler's jokes and songs on his CD's are pretty funny."
4216,"Great original, imaginative, extreme action and fabulous stunts make this a great watch for all. It was an inoffensive movie with great stunts and lovable characters. A commercial director (Rufus Sewell, who has certainly done better work elsewhere) assembles a group of extreme athletes (including Bridgette Wilson - Sampras as a Gold Medal Skier? ) Hollywood has always been quick to react to new trends if it believes it can make money from them, and at the beginning of the current decade the movie studios responded to the increasing high profile of so - called' extreme sports' by using them as the basis of a short - lived wave of action movies. Trying to plow your snowboard into a helicopter to hit someone is your best weapon."
4217,"Visually, the Solaris future is a conservative, believable vision, reminiscent in look to that of Gatacca. Soderbergh's eye for detail is evident here, as everything has a purpose and look that fits perfectly with the overall feel. There are dazzlingly and ecstatically artistic visual moments to offer that dreamlike stance. The sets and costumes also retain the sense of engineering realism combined with beauty. Some examples are the wonderfully minimalistic soundtrack, and the very Soderbergh symbolic use of lighting and color saturation to shift from the retrospective to the live - action shot."
4218,"There are moments of joy and pathos to be found throughout. This movie has pretty much everything required of a superb movie. they all are stunning with these 18th century ships. But beyond the technical qualities, "" Treasure Planet "" captures the spirit of Disney much better than recent Disney debacles (see Valiant, Chicken Little, Home on the Range). There are plenty of funny moments, endearing moments (without being sappy), and just the right touch of suspense to keep you hanging on."
4219,"It's everything you want in a great Horror. There's a lot of potential and beautiful scenes in this movie. The story lasts about 1 hr and 30 mins and fits everything in nicely. The little discoveries she makes are creepy and intriguingly enthralling. "" They "" definitely works better on viewers who are home alone at night."
4224,"But it's good for a couple laughs. Two thumbs way up for this one. People like Robin Williams are trying to cross over to serious roles as is Jim Carrey and this guy makes it look like anybody could do it. ( Harold Ramis) turns to remakes (Bedazzled - 2000), and sequels (Analyze That - 2002) after years of his "" original "" masterpiece as a writer, producer, and director (Groundhog Day - 1993). All of these movies have more charm than this one."
4225,"Dalilah Cotto and Denise Richards are attractive and enjoyable and Peter Saasgard as a hotshot business manager is magnificent. Yet, his acting shines in several scenes. Not totally original, it could be seen as a homage to many of its predecessors, yet it delivers and keeps you interested right until the very end. Leguizamo portrays Victor well, with smarts, feelings and charisma. Reyes used an interesting lighting technique, making the ghetto scenes appear more golden and the uptown scenes a darker, blue - ish color."
4226,"Jonze does do a very good job once again. Again, he's given a brilliant opening scene and he works wonders with it. Spike Jonze is merciless in this regard. Amidst some cloying self - referential clap - trap, there are actually some really freshing film moments. Akin to "" Being John Malkovich "" really."
4227,"The film is really great, quick action, combined with a brilliantly stated philosophical question, breathtaking scenes with lots of effects, superb actors! there are so many twists and turns, you'll be on the edge of your seat with suspense the majority of the time. The most impressive material on this surface level is the gun fu action stuff, which almost "" out - Matrixes "" The Matrix in style, if not volume. Just as important as dialogue for Wimmer's commentary on man's emotions are body language and behavior. On its surface, after a brief action - oriented beginning, Equilibrium is basically a progression from a fairly complex sci - fi film (meaning simply that it takes a lot of exposition to get up to speed) to a thriller to a "" gun fu "" - styled actioner."
4244,"It is funny, and yes, painful at times. Plus it had the added bonus of major babes Anna Faris and Rachel McAdams. A comedy well worth watching for lots of laughs. Turns out these jewelery pieces are magical and allow body - switching. His teenage girl is hilarious, and everyone turns in a pretty good job, especially the much mentioned Anna Faris, who can, despite Scary Movie's evidence to the contrary, act, and very well, too."
4243,"Aficianados can appreciate the tight flams, rolls, high sticking. Drumline is a great movie for anybody to see. not what your preconceived notions lead you to believe it might be. Drumline is a great movie--but you have to see it for what it is. One last point--the movie grossed 13 + million dollars in its opening weekend."
4245,"The story is one that's been told a hundred thousand times - and has been done a hundred thousand times better. Nice acting from all parts and a cool soundtrack with Norah Jones. Then watch it again, and again, for the pleasure of discovering the tapestry of truths it contains. If you like these kinds of movies that leave you feeling good and happy about life, then you'll enjoy this tastefully done movie as well. Nice fantasy romance starring Jennifer Lopez that seems to rank high amongst her fans."
4246,"The face off between the two characters in the final 30 minutes is very exciting. Star Treks II, III and IV sure seem a long time ago now. Until then, this is just satisfying enough to those who thirst for outerspace action. on a desert planet that resolves in a grin - inducing fashion, and a fast - paced shootout on board Shinzon's warship, the Scimitar, which also resolves in a pretty cool manner. The perfectly recreated spirit of the T. V series, the emphasis and development of character, excellent action set pieces and the perfect, solid storyline that mixes the personal and the epic."
4247,"Will most assuredly be one of the best movies of the fist decade of the new century. The combination of Jack, this story and these settings is effective and compelling. For many years he has worked as an actuary at a big insurance company. Instead of using a typical' boohoo' orchestra, the film uses beautiful wandering piano and marimba sounds. Dermot Mulroney turns in another excellent performance this time as the dim witted fiancÃ©."
4248,"There's a kind of amiable smoothness to the events, and frequent humorous moments. There are a lot of well - meaning friends and acquaintances. The story is based a true situation in the mid 1950s Ireland in which, in the end, the Irish Constitution was amended because of this case. Sophie Vavasseur does an excellent job in the title role of Evelyn. On that Catholic, or "" religious, "" angle, you get a lot of positive and negative scenes here."
4250,"The cinematography is, again, one of the best aspects of the film. The scenery is marvelous, the animations great, and the story superb. Douris _ Became _ Wormtongue in a skillful fulfillment of what was already inspired casting. However, here he is more of a leading character and a' star ,' and his convincing dual - personality, stabbing voice, and well - choreographed body movements make him consistently eye - grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears. Viggo Mortensen, John Rhys - Davies, and Orlando Bloom made a great trio."
4251,"Edward Norton is always great in everything he plays, but in this film he is just excellent. There are some stellar performances here. Lee's trademarks are present here and the cinematography suits the feel of the movie very well. In fact the entire cast is something to admire in this movie: Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Anna Paquin and Barry Pepper. Frank, on the other hand, is on the opposite end of the character spectrum, he's a good - looking, rich Wall Street trader, who, unlike, his nebbish friend, has never had a problem with the ladies."
4252,"The lead performances are very good indeed. With every step he takes in the scenes, his presence commands the screen! All the actors give full blooded performances with conviction and realism. And Mychaela Danna's music scores contribute wonderfully to the intensity of the moods of characters. The on screen chemistry between Washington's Dr. Davenport and Luke's Antwone, and between Antwone and Joy Bryant's Cheryl is captivating."
4253,"This is another fascinating visual film with great sets, costumes, color and camera - work. The verdict: A fabulous film, which is going to be recognized for such in some years The sets look great, the costumes look great and the dramatic flair he gives in delivery add so much. Large, slope shouldered and vaguely brutish looking, DiCaprio is physically perfect for Amsterdam. In moments like these, ` Gangs of New York' almost touches greatness."
4254,"An enjoyable film and one deserving pride of place on any DVD shelf. Entertaining stuff worth a look for Bullock or Grant fans and romcom junkies. She is sexy and gifted and has the perfect talent and timing to easily take over the mantle of stars like Irene Dunne, Jean Arthur, Katherine Hepburn, Doris Day and more recently Meg Ryan as a true queen of Rom - Com. Sure, his movies follow the same formula, but they are just fun to watch. The woman is naturally beautiful and her comic timing is impeccable and it is no surprise that she's known as one of the finest comedy actresses (and she's great in other roles too)."
4255,"The cast and characters are good â€“ hardly difficult or complex but still good enough to do the job. 5) adored it and their folks had fun too! from Curry, Chabert, Kane etc and the support cast is good with enjoyable little roles for Woodard, Redgrave, Tomei and Everett - who takes to the role with a bit of relish and his tongue in his cheek. Some exaggeration is given to the characters for comic effect and it works. This movie is great for kids, and has talented talents like Tim Curry, Lyn Redgrave, and Flea (okay so that is an odd one to add to the mix) to appease the adults."
4256,"Produced by Liotta and Tom Cruise (among others); one of the year's best. Therefore, Tellis is able to get Oak back onto the case. It would be easy to just accept his performance as a ` powerhouse' but it also has sensitivity, emotion and layers to it. He's always been a terrific actor and its hard to forget those eyes of his when he sinks his teeth into a role like this. The cast are excellent, although really the film hinges on the two leads."
4272,A few things stand out and of course the performances are terrific. And Christopher Walken gives one of his best performances in his already interesting career. It was a refreshing blast to see the 60s portrayed in such a vivid and colorful way. Frank Abagnale Jr. is an astounding and interesting character. Walken conveys these emotions and makes the audience react just accurately.
4273,"Fantastic performances are all over this film. 1920s Chicago comes alive in breathtaking detail. The strength of their performances alone is almost enough to carry the film. Plus, the picture is very sharp, in all a good DVD to own for fans of musical comedies. Aside from strong direction from Rob Marshall, the film is blessed with memorable performances from it's three leads."
4274,"The rest of the cast is brilliant: Miranda Richardson, Tony Colette, Ed Harris, John C. Reilly, and little Jack Rovello. The sure hand of the director is obviously behind her reining the excesses she likes so well. All three performances are extraordinary in their own unique ways and there are wonderful performances from all members of the supporting cast. The Hours is skillfully directed by Stephen Daldry and contains some of the finest performances of the year. She has a son who shows all the signs, even then, of what he might ultimately become in life."
4275,"Taylor plays the right chords, and it works. The direction is strong and one scene in which Hitler's rants are rapidly alternated with a Jewish service is blindingly powerful. Great performances by Cusack (Max Rothman) and Noah Taylor (Adolph Hitler). Wonderful script, mediocre direction and two fabulous performances make this one worth seeing. Writer / first time Director Menno Meyjes (The Seige ` Screenplay') has crafted a compelling and challenging story."
4276,"Douglas McGrathdid a fine job directing this film. All in all this makes a pleasant occasion, if somehow tamed, at the movies. Charlie Hunnam is gorgeous and capable as Nicholas, and herein lies the problem. Above all, the film is blessed with a cast made up of first - rate performers who bring each of the author's creations to vivid life. This movie is a treat for the ears, as well."
4277,"The scary moments are real scary. This movie doesn't judge anybody, or tries to explain anything - it shows historical events as a reflection of one man's fate, making a powerful testimony that stays with you long after the beautiful last shot and the end credits are over. He is a simple man that is doing everything in his power to stay alive. Everything is shown from Szpielman's point of view, and it is all very gritty and realistic. This is one of the all time great performances."
4280,"He does a great job in some respects by creating great scenes that shift from one layer or time to another. Many of the camera shots were close - ups, which looked quite cool. Many scenes were standout, with their camera angles and unique way of playing it. All three levels are shown here, all sliced and diced according to Kaufman's clever folding techniques. ` Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' marks an auspicious debut for Clooney as a director, who, in his work behind the camera, demonstrates a thorough command of vision and style."
4283,"` Rosetta', the previous movies made by the ` brothers' - as Jean - Pierre and Luc Dardenne are referred to in Belgium - was great. The film was blessed with the controlled performance of Olivier Gourmet, an actor who has worked with the Dardennes before. You are moved by this movie because Olivier and the Dardenne expressed the purest emotions. This film is a tour de force for Mr. Gourmet who carries the film by the sheer energy he brings to his Olivier. The Dardenne brothers are masters of exploding the minutiae of everyday life to beautiful, poetic proportions."
4304,"A real good hearted, feel good movie with some wise insights into peoples' foibles. An homage to Bollywood, "" Grease "" and possibly Dr. Ruth, "" The Guru "" could be listed prominently in a cinematic encyclopedia under the heading of' cute cute cute'. Heather Graham and Marisa Tomei are beautiful as usual, and there are many funny scenes. In addition, all of his antics were hilarious. The Guru is very light entertainment, but it delivers by offering nothing more than a few laughs and musical numbers that will have your feet tapping the floor."
4305,"It wasn't the best of shoots and his perfectionism resulted in eccentric, intolerable shooting schedules. You have to admire Gilliam for signing off on this doco. A great film, and a powerful warning to those who thinking making movies is easy. All of these factors are explored in this film, and it's actually bitter - sweet, going back and forth until the last twenty minutes or so of the film. It is a depressing last twenty minutes of film, but it is still fascinating how it becomes clear that the production will not go on."
4306,"May is simply one of the greatest horror films from last years. those exceptional films that are not for everyone, that manage to be both creepy and gory at the same time, in a way that's not quite easily classifiable, and so they are never considered "" mainstream "" by mass audiences in the multiplexes, or critics into selling sound - bites rather than writing decent reviews. Angela Bettis is astounding as May. Angela Bettis (who also starred in Tobe Hooper's "" Toolbox Murders "" remake) is an extremely underrated actress, she was excellent in this movie and delivered a top - notch performance. Angela Bettis is excellent; she is really beautiful, really vulnerable, and really expressive without doing much."
4343,"And those forbidding landscapes are hauntingly beautiful. "" Gerry "" thus has qualities that make it rather Zen - like. The desert landscapes are impressive and really well captured â€“ what a shame that you do not go to the cinema just to stare at landscapes. Rather just a few minor disagreements on how they got there and the best way to get out of the situation, interspersed with some cussing. After leaving the theater, you truly contemplate the strange trip you just took through the middle of nowhere while you draw parallels to your own adventures."
4344,"Add in the American know - how of creepiness from "" Fatal Attraction "" and "" One Hour Photo, "" and the French writer / director Laetitia Colombani, mais oui, applies it all to matters of the heart. There are a lot of inferences as to what happened in the film. This is one of those mixed genre movies that actually works! Audrey Tautou is so charming and capable as an actress that she makes you root for her even when you know she's playing someone completely crazy. Coming from a tradition that does not lack great actors, beautiful divas, living legends, and huge comedians, Audrey seems to bring together talent and beauty, huge interior and exterior beauty."
4352,"The DVD is well worth getting hold of. The whole background story with the lawsuit against the cops who beat up Afro - American Rodney King is cleverly used to stage the 90's setting. This is not a typical character for Kurt Russell, and it's one of his best films from the past 10 years. This was a well crafted cop flick where everyone seems to have dirt on someone else, and meanwhile, there are crimes being committed, and L. A. is about to erupt in rioting. Russell does give one of his strongest performances in recent years and is not afraid to be an unsympathetic lead character."
4356,"The thing that is interesting about this film is the way that everything filtered together. In the lobby following the showing and discussion were DVDs for sale, one just of the documentary, the other a special three - disc set with much added material. Finally, a movie made by someone who understands the magic of books. Several of the interviewees, highly regarded authors, recount their own bouts with depression and at least transient failure. This, combined with some other qualities that show some unusual obsessive behavior, may have made for an even better film (in some respects, in league with Crumb), with the quest for Mossman reduced, and then a study of Mossman taking up the bulk of the feature."
4357,"It is a brilliant exploration of the Unconscious, of The Edipus Complex, and of Guilt. His ability to create a wholly original feel in film incomparable to any of his contemporaries is always welcomed by this viewer. This is such an incredibly complex film, with so many levels of interpretations and ambiguity, which most great films offer an audience. "" Spider "" works almost entirely without special effects and yet like many of Cronenberg's movies it has a hallucinatory, trippy quality from first to last. The novel that is based on, must have a lot of Freud psyche theories, because the film just reflects it."
4362,"It's an often slow but alluring tale, absorbing you in to the story of characters that are both familiar and alien, and ending up with an odd but truthful ending that pulls out all the raw, closeted emotions that the two men have for each other, and it's home - movie - style video shoot and beautiful country scenery brings it to life. The highlights certainly include both Gosling and Morse's acting, Gosling being an up - and - coming star, and Morse being an extremely well - established character actor with a good feel for disparate emotions. The scene in the hospital at the end of the movie when Gid takes Roy's hand and places it on his forehead was very moving. In The Slaughter Rule as well as other recent offerings like L. I. E. or Priest or Taboo (originally Gohatto), characters reveal emotions that seem designed specifically to break new ground in the amorphic area between ordinary storytelling and what some would call pornography. It took a good fifteen minutes of footage before there was an edit or a line of dialogue that made any sense, and it took another 30 minutes before the ham - fisted script gave way to a working plot that wasn't contingent on a close - up of Ryan Gosling's smile or contrived moralizing."
4363,"The performances of these two characters was nothing short of amazing. Like middle class life anywhere, there are the written rules and conventions that one must obey, and then there are the practicalities, and the REalities. The opening sequence reaches such an emotional peak that the remaining conversations become almost anti-climactic. But Hitchcock's brilliant "" Rear Window "" was a gimmick too, and Kiarostami's "" 10 "" is no less worthy of attention. By experiencing these exchanges, the viewer can expect a crash course on middle class life in Iran."
4366,"All of the performances are pitch - perfect. Praise must also be given to Bekinsale (` Pearl Harbor') and Nivola (` Jurassic Park 3') for their exceptional performances. The actual neighborhoods and the style of the houses in that part of Hollywood are presented perfectly, thanks in no small part to the location shooting, but it also captures the attitude in many ways as well. ` Laurel Canyon' is an intriguing character - driven drama, written and directed by Lisa Cholodenko and featuring first - rate performances by Frances McDormand, Christian Bale, Kate Beckinsale, Alessandro Nivola and Natascha McElhone. Well directed, admirably cast, with an ambiguous and thoughtful script, plus enough sexual tension to fuel a score of teen comedies."
4368,"The film moves very fast and keeps the audiance entertained. The wedding scenes are dazzlingly beautiful. Parminder K. Nagra is utterly winning as young Jess, capturing all the innate optimism and unquenchable enthusiasm of this irrepressible character. This film trots along nicely at a lovely pace, never dwelling on anything longer than necessary nor leaving anything unfinished, keeping the viewer entertained and mentally engaged. The culture in this case is that of immigrant and first - generation Indians living in Great Britain."
4389,"Two scenes of unbelievable stupidity are worth mentioning. ( Victoria Silvstedt, who really is from Sweden, is quite beautiful, BTW). In that respect it's not unlike "" Deuce Bigalow, Male Gigolo "", or some of the more risquÃ© Benny Hill skits: sure it's stupid, vulgar and corny, but sometimes exactly those kinds of comedies can fill a comedy niche with certain viewers. Everyone is kissing and touching and making sexual advances at everyone else. When they do so under an orange tree, oranges fall down, so that afterward they are covered in about 100 oranges."
4400,"Throughout the film you get to know certain characters like Vicky, Nino, Grandma, Judy and even Judy's best friend Melonie. But Raising Victor Vargas is only Sollett's second film, and his most well known, a solid effort in filmmaking that will hopefully get better as he continues to make films. A few years ago seeing an "" independent "" film meant that you would likely be treated to some originality and a lot of energy and care, and maybe a few technical glitches caused by the low budgets, nowadays, it means that chances are you'll get yet another by - the - numbers, let's - shake - the - camera - around - for - two - hours attempt at placating the lack of taste of independent distributors. The movie starts off in ` Ugly Fat' Donna's bedroom where Victor is sure to seduce her, but a cry from outside disrupts his plans when his best - friend Harold (Kevin Rivera) comes - a-looking for him."
4401,"This one was long, over 2 hours. Mrs. Hubers comment "" well life goes on "" was so trite. Tonya, her friend, and Wanda reflect the very best about people and shatter easy stereotypes. This superb film lays a lot of truths about humanity pitilessly bare. Steve James does a great job of injecting himself into a situation while trying to wipe his hands clean of any responsibility."
4404,"If there is such a thing as colorful film noir, this would be it, with many splashes of the neon nightlife of France, inside and outside. The young girl in here, Nutsa Kukhianidze, is intriguing new face, as was the case with Isabelle Corey in "" Bob . "" Bob as a "" good thief "" is all that matters. Set on the scenic French Riviera, Neil Jordan's ` The Good Thief' is a remake of 1955's ` Bob Le Flambeur ,' a Gallic film that enjoyed a successful re-release in this country a few years back. The cast makes this film, especially Nutsa Kukhianidze as Anne and Said Taghmaoui as Paulo, whose interaction take the film in an even more interesting direction, while the addition of identical twins (the Polish brothers) was a stroke of genius."
4405,"Fabulous entertainment and a good display of creativity. Thanks to Farrell's performance it makes for good mainstream cinema (normally an oxymoron) and may actually make a few top ten lists. Farrell also demonstrates a presence, beyond mere charisma - his good looks can only inspire interest for so long - that draw the viewer into the story. Reminiscent of his much - lauded turn in ` Tigerland', Farrell confirms that he isn't a one trick pony, proffering a wide - ranging display of emotions, from cocky to cathartic without straying into soap opera or comic territory. While Mitchell and Holmes did not have lengthy parts, their roles added just enough to the story and they managed to perform up to the standards of their characters."
3616,"Very nice review in Russian located here: http: / / www. The movie is humorous, fun, and moves along quickly. All the actors do a great job. the second sploy of this film that is more than enjoyable is the comical askew view of Florida. The strengths of this film are actors like Tim Allen, Jason Lee, Dennis Farina, and Tom Sizemore."
4409,"And most of the people on the planet live very hard lives. Lilja is beautifully portrayed by Oksana Akinshina. Different than Tillsammans and Fuckin Ã…mÃ¥l in style, but still absolutely fascinating. The frames come so strong that you start to empathize with Lilya after some point. Anyone with a heart will be touched and anyone with a taste on movies will be stunned by this movie."
4420,"That fact that this story unfolded LITERALLY in front of first time director Sam Jones' eyes is pretty amazing. Wilco's music and the film's atmosphere are incredibly in sync, showing further dedication on both fronts. It's exciting to see an album taking shape before your eyes in this manner. The commentary on the DVD was surprisingly funny as well. Great studio footage, cool live band stuff, and some less compelling live Tweedy solo performances."
4430,"When one says that they are excited to see a documentary on the 8th graders' National Spelling Bee, that person is met with a look and an ` Oooookaaaay This was a delightful inside view of what these teen agers go through in preparing for the competition. The common denominators these eight individuals all share are intelligence, drive, determination and a supportive family structure. The film does a good job of showing the backgrounds of the kids and presenting their personalities. Yet, for all their seeming ` nerdness' and gift for articulation, Blitz makes it clear that these kids are really just kids (albeit highly gifted ones) after all."
4433,"In some respects the work is reminiscent of Costa - Gavras's "" State Of Siege "", a clip of which is actually used here. Javier Bardem is excellent in the pivotal role. The film is also beautifully shot, the locations in Ecuador and Oporto, Portugal, being used to great advantage. Maybe it's asking too much for political explanations, though the director clearly wants the film to be compared with Costa - Gravas' excellent ` State of Siege' (which is shown briefly at one point and provides a vital clue as to Ezequiel's location). Juan Diego Botto does a very credible job as Detective Sgt. Sucre."
4436,"Two protagonists and a director: a perfect alchemy between the three. He has such presence and charisma that you can't take your eyes off him whenever he appears on the screen. Photographed in a shades of gray palette that is almost in black - and - white, a small town and its interconnections and personalities are beautifully evoked. The emphasis is on very gradual, internal realizations by each character that are revealed by a subtle accretion of surprising little decisions, such as wearing slippers or getting a new haircut, culminating in an unpredictable, yet beautifully satisfying conclusion. With all those looks and his face, always full of hidden things."
4438,"And to any distributors that may read this - please take notice of this movie. Mr. Swain tries to do, be, create all of these things in one package. The story features well written, witty, and humorous dialog that moves the plot line believably through the years that the story encompasses. Only a truly talented director could accomplish this, making his hard work appear so effortless, resulting in the most fun an audience has had in years. His performance lends credibility to the character he is portraying as he grows through landmarks of history (gay historical landmarks in particular)."
4449,"Even drive - ins were a great source in "" them days "", right up through the '70s. Absence of talented and dedicated projectionists is equally harmful. "" Cinemania "" is really both sad and beautiful at the same time. The astounding thing is how proud the cinemaniacs seem of their obsession and the utter lack of anything else in their lives. CINEMANIA is a film for its subject matter: film geeks."
4452,"TMBG are witty and on point most of the time. Their music continues to be high quality after twenty years, and they are still quite entertaining. They Might Be Giants are one of the vanguards of rock music, and AJ Schnack's documentary does everything in its power to echo and reinforce that statement. The movie, as a whole, is entertaining for fans, and enticing for novices. A great movie made even better on DVD."
4459,"She imbues every scene with a commanding and inviting vitality. The grandparents are very well portrayed by Rawiri Paratene and Vicky Houghton. This is a film for all ages to enjoy. Then, in the last third, when the whales actually come into play, the story enters territory that is thrillingly unpredictable and incredibly powerful. Then something happens as the film flashes forward 12 years."
4513,"Intelligent, repulsive at times, unbearable, this was one of the best films of 2003. Like most great masterpieces of their time , 28 Days Later has been misunderstood by a considerable amount of people. If you like your horror flicks, then this is certainly worthy of your attention. Mark Tildesley's production design, as well as John Murphy's music, evokes haunting, evocative moods even in the more mundane scenes. Every person, even the harshest critic of zombie horror movies should watch this."
3765,"These two young actors have wonderful moments, and they play it straight. His mere presence in a scene can make it funny; often he brings out laughs with a look or a eyebrow twitch. The movie has its share of ridiculous, over-the-top gags (A dean of admissions high on ecstasy, for example), but it's far more interested in its characters than its jokes, a refreshing change of pace for this type of movie. The material's supported by some very good performances, especially from leads Colin Hanks and Jack Black. It may sound like a dumb story but the characters and situations surrounding it provoke the maximum amount of laughter."
4539,"It is subtle, entertaining, excels with its dark humor, and is an accurate portrayal of what immigrants suffer - not only in London, but around the globe. The revelation in this picture is Chiwetel Ejiofor, who is just brilliant as Okwe, the illegal immigrant at the center of the story. Much buzz, fortunately all merited, preceded it: an amazing Nigerian actor, Chiwetel Ejiofor, already acclaimed for his stage performances, makes his big - screen debut, while Audrey Tatou, the impossibly wide - eyed kook from 2001's ` Amelie', tackles her first English - language movie role. It isn't often that a cutting - edge foreign director who's taken a dip in Hollywood waters can ever recapture the style and flair that got him noticed by Hollywood in the first place, but it would seem that French actress Audrey Tatou is a good - luck charm for a director attempting to perform such a feat. Okwe, the cause of her problems, feels duty - bound to see that she remains safe."
8325,"), though it is easily understood that he does the movies for the playful and curious child in himself, as well was not detrimental at all, because it's not about the story told in words, anyway, but about telling it in "" thousand times "" more descriptive pictures, worming up the feelings, playfulness and imagination omnipresent in children, and, though seemingly forgotten, eventually only suppressed in grown - ups, ergo dormant potential that can be easily activated through the well - administered incentive from the skillful wake - up caller. Film offers many favourable ingredients contained in Miyazaki's other, mainly hand - drawn animated adventures: humorous, colourful characters, including child (ren), often girl (s) protagonist (s), character driven animation, subtlety in timing and movements, enchanting visuals with watercolour - like backgrounds, actions involving flying. Like all Miyazaki films, the beauty and wonder is in the drawing and the characterization of children, specifically Mei. ( And what a delightful visit there it was , 20 months ago, almost to the day, in May 2009 . )"
3778,"It was quite refreshing compared to some so called "" comdies "". However, many * do * work and provide belly laughs. The weakest parts of this one are the scenes that were added to the movie while the best stuff is when the main character interjects himself into the movie or adds things to the original movie. This film is a masterpiece of comic re-dubbing. As The Chosen One, Oedekerk seems to have a great time."
3779,"And the ending is an all's well that ends well with everyone happy and satisfied. There are also solid support from grizzled screen veteran James Coburn and the ever - elegant Nichelle Nichols of "" Star Trek "" fame. With parents and brother and friends who were around 25 yrs old and niece 10 yrs old and they liked it. Everyone who knows "" happy "" huskys know they smile all the time in real life - it's part of their personality. Wonderful scenery, beautiful dogs, & good acting, especially by Cuba Gooding, Jr. ."
4553,"Excellent acting, nimble direction and very well crafted representations of real - historical events and persons. Indeed, this is the part of the film where the question gets the most light, and it's the most harrowing scene in the movie among others and is one of the most powerful in movies this year. Eileen Walsh should get a special award for an incredible performance as Crispina - Eileen, you are fantastic! Through the fine acting of the cast the complexity of relationships and the nature of choices become engrossing. Their life after the asylum is reported in the end credits."
4554,"Hope Davis, Dennis Leary and three young girls all gave great performances. All appearances point out to the fact that his dentist wife, has found someone that satisfies her more than the good husband. THE SECRET LIFE OF DENTISTS (2003) *** 1/2 Campbell Scott, Hope Davis, Denis Leary, Robin Tunney, Gianna Beleno, Cassidy Hinkle, Lydia Jordan. Campbell Scott is very impressive as an introvert Dr. David Hurst. Campbell Scott is an actor whose face registers all the emotions this David Hurst is feeling without much effort."
3792,"To have everything usurped from you only to take it all back twenty fold is not only intriguing, it is absolutely diabolical and gives you a sense of power. Perhaps that is why the story transcends generations and time frames. Ironic that he would be giving Caviezel - who two years later was playing Jesus in "" The Passion Of The Christ "" - sermons about believing in God! Monte Cristo boasts the talent of both Guy Pearce and Jim Caviezal as former friends who have turned against each other in the epic - set Napoleanic French era. That was cleared up, and the rest was just enjoying the scenery and performances."
5724,"If you have already seen the American re-make of The Grudge with Sarah Michelle Geller then there's a good chance that this follow up to the Japanese original will come as something of shock. But, without spoiling the surprises, some new and unexpected twists are added to the mythology. Besides the obvious rerun of old tricks, some of the new material is actually quite interesting and well - thought of. There are some great visual effects here; Kayako and her wild hair spread over a ceiling, tendrils dropping down into lethal nooses; a wig come to hideous life and the ghostly blue Toshio staring out of the darkness. When you finally pick up the courage to turn around and look, you realise your mind has been playing tricks on you, but the thrill was still heart - stopping regardless."
5913,"The film is very stylishly shot, and this has lead many to label it a' Giallo'. Add that to some lovely music, classy acting and enough gore to fill an abattoir - and what you've got is the makings of a cult classic! This is a film made by a director that grew up perhaps admiring some of the greats from three decades ago. The performances by Cecile de France, Maewenn and the actor who portrays the killer are perfect. Dubbing only takes away from the amazing performances."
6008,"Truly a must have, multi-layered, bearing repeated viewings, beautifully directed, performed, and filmed. The other performances are quite solid as well. ( Update: The miniseries received 21 Emmy nominations and won a record (for miniseries) 11 Emmys. Its texts are wonderfully written, unafraid of pathos, farce and intellectualism alike, and fiercely direct in their expression. There were the great performances by Al Pacino, Meryl Streep, Justin Kirk, and Jeffrey Wright and the good performances by Emma Thompson, Mary - Louise Parker, Patrick Wright and, in a small role, James Cromwell."
7723,"See it for for entertaining minutes. This is getting wide exposure as it is playing in front of The Incredibles (another Pixar triumph). Beautiful animation (as expected by Pixar). Amazing how much emotion is packed in a slim 5 minutes. The message is sung and the rhyming in the lyrics is just tremendous, really enjoyable."
6025,"It just fits (it is a movie about making pornos). In all a funny movie with just a couple of scenes making the entire movie worth it. See it if you enjoyed the movies Road Trip or Eurotrip. To summarise it was one of the good comedies around there â€“ and if you enjoy movies such as "" American Pie "" you will enjoy this one as well. It is mildly entertaining at the very most and does not come close to other teenage or high school movies."
7222,"Ricky Gervais is a funny man. Saying that, every part with Ricky is a highlight - his facial expressions are hilarious! There are many moments where people will just say "" He's being David Brent "" but it's just the way the guy is and technically he is David Brent! It's the subtleties in his humor that makes it so great. "" Animals "" really does contain some incredibly excellent humour."
6066,"And the best is that Bengt Alsterlind from (Hajk) has a part in "" Slim Susie "". This enables the movie to take very surprising and funny twists. It was witty, original (but still had some similarities to the Swedish movie kopps), and very well made. The characters were all very funny in a clumsy and idiosyncratic sort of way. As mentioned, a great dialogue, extra credit to whoever wrote that and to whoever created the different characters."
7159,"The many scenes on the roof top actually represent reaching a higher level of understanding. Let's first discuss Mr. Wiseau's expert crafting of dramatic tension. The best part of the movie is Mr. Wiseau's acting. While most bad movies offer a handful of terrible scenes divided by stretches of just plain dull, writer - director - producer - star Tommy Wiseau's film offers one moment of disaster after another. Also Tommy Wiseau's name is mentioned 6 times before the film even begins and his character is of course "" perfect "" that everyone should just love him."
4626,"What a story of triumph over circumstances! It does take a few minutes to really get good but when it does, it's wonderful. Whatever, it was so breathtakingly beautiful that anyone should be entranced by it's sheer visual assault on the senses. Frances adapts to the house and the locals with remarkable aplomb. When you add great performances by a fine cast, and an interesting story, you can't loose."
4281,"The beautiful thing about comedy is that it knows no bounds and is broad enough to appeal to every human being on earth. Movies are all about inventing lives, so those niches are now defined by comics and routines that are all about helping the audience decide who they are. His shows uses what appear to be real demons from his past to make you laugh, and laugh you will. Go figure JEFF FOXWORTHY - Foxworthy is now a guilty pleasure. Foxworthy has some "" new "" redneck words as well."
6144,"Lisbela e o Prisioneiro is an example of this growth. The performance of actors was very very good and the timing was perfect. It is a hilarious "" northeastern "" comedy, with great performances from Selton Mello and Debora Falabella. Lisbela e o Prisioneiro is a good comedy, it will certainly make you have a very good time when you see it. It is definitely worth watching, if for nothing else then for Selton Mello's acting."
4282,"It has to be said that both look terrific, and Kutcher in particular has developed a very nice style in physical comedy. As a means of silly entertainment, it's sweet, good - natured and occasionally funny, even if all the gags are recycled from other flicks. Ashton Kutcher stars as Tom and he does a good job. Because there are enough laughs to keep it going - especially in the first half of the film. Brittany Murphy and Ashton Kutcher were great together, they made a really good pair."
4284,"Both Jason Lee and Julia Stiles give nice performances. However it is funny enough to cover the cracks. He is a good lead here and keeps bits of his ` Brody' from Mallrats to good effect. There were times when this movie was absolutely hilarious. There were plenty of good acting performances, considering the material."
4285,"The best things in the film are the settings. This is a typical O'Connell role and he plays it well. She looks good no matter what she does anyway but the movie does not lower her standards at all. The story is a bit good at parts, but far - fetched at others. The CG Kangaroo is pretty good, better than much of the CG in the last Star Wars atrocity."
4286,"The point is, "" National Security "" provides some laughs and is an all - around good film, though not great. Of Lawrence, this couldn't get nay lower for him, but Zahn deserves better than this. In fairness Robinne Lee (Denise) is gorgeous and it is good to see her in something again after only seeing her in Hav Plenty. "" National Security "" is a decent flick and is well worth the price of admission, at least in the eyes of this reviewer. Steve Zahn and martin Lawrence do portray a good but unstable team in the film but thats all part of the humour."
4297,"( thats another story) This film is good simple fun. What really matters in a film like this is the horror material, and director Jonathan Liebesman handles it skillfully. it has some tense moments with a few decent action sequences and a decent, straightforward ending without the usual unexpected (but really expected) ) twist. Liebesman only spends as much time as necessary with "" serious drama "" to amplify the horror. the purpose, to pretend to entertain the viewer, well hiding the movie's shortcomings."
4301,"Bythewood made a splash at Sundance a few years ago with his debut ` Dancing in September. Director Reggie Rock Bythewood makes his presence felt in the film. Had Bythewood been smart enough to use the original unedited script as opposed to the one he and Craig hacked together he would have had a great movie under his directing debut. The nonfiction foundation of the film shines through, displaying a bizarre sense of camaraderie between cyclists similar to that of a fraternal order. The camera freewheels around smoking tires, colorful racing suits and bouncing nightclubs with dizzying ease."
4302,"David R. Ellis directs and he does really good job. A. J. Cook plays Kimberly and she does an okay job. He also directed the fast paced and exciting Cellular. A couple of the death scenes do go over the top though the film delivers the goods for the most part. There is a nice score by Shirley Walker which creates some suspense, the opening highway pile - up has some great stuntwork and most of the characters have horror - film director names."
4303,"At this point, the story's focus gets much sharper and things become more consistently interesting, with a few cool twists. Although having many clichÃ©s, this film is a great thriller, full of plot points, and in the end, a good entertainment. All in all this is good viewing but could have been much better but it's apparent that the makers were ok with just ok, and that's ok. He has even features and his acting stays on track. Which is unfortunate since "" The Recruit "" has an interesting premise, is well acted especially by Colin Farrell and Bridget Moynahan, and maintains suspense throughout."
4338,"LL Cool J and Gaberille Union have very good chemisty togetehr and carry the film. It was great to watch the personality transformations as they happened. This movie was touching and sincere for a Black movie (a trait which is played down in most Black flicks), there's been a recent departure from the gangsta and hood epics or drugs and money flicks. However, this is more serious in a sense and relative to other audiences. Essence Attkins, Megan Good and Robinee Lee all dyme pieces also do acting jobs and the men in their lives played by Mel Jackson and Duane Martin make the film enjoyable also."
4339,"It had classics and modern day classics. The chemistry between Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey is great. It is there the audience experiences an honest, genuine quality time the coming off the screen between Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey. Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson made this film with impeccable comic timing and enjoyable performances. This plot seemed quite original and as a battle of the sexes comedy, they seldom come as good as this."
4340,"FINAL VERDICT: This is worth renting if you are looking for some laughs and entertaining night. This has plenty of Chan stunts with ladders, amazing kicks, and swords. Seeing these two work together in beautifully choreographed fights was a dream come true. Aiden Gillen is good as Lord Rathbone, then fantastic in his action scenes. Then there is another masterpiece: "" The Godfather "", all though many people seem to agree that however great, "" The Godfather Part II "" is even better."
4341,"Everything makes sense now, and the characters are more fleshed out, which is a very good thing. First off, this was a more complete version of the DVD which came out earlier. Wow, you don't hear that much in movies. If you're a fan of the first two Batman movies, you'll find a lot to love in Daredevil. Here's a simple plan for your money making schemes - and this goes to Gary Foster (producer who still says the theatrical version of daredevil is better) If you make a GOOD MOVIE, that gets good reviews, and that fans & critics enjoy, then more people will see it, more people will see it a 2nd time, more people will recommend it to friends, and that means a bigger audience, a repeat audience and bigger dollars for your pockets!"
4342,"Likewise, Zooey Deschanel's performance was authentic and devastating. "" Tully "" had very similar character and story arcs, and, while schmaltzier, was more satisfying as a movie experience. Zooey Deschanel is a really a beautiful woman, has a stunning performance and shows a great chemistry with Paul Schneider. It does this two ways first as other reviewers have noted the cast in the film portrays a realistic group of people making the best of it in a small town. They share innermost secrets and inhabit a sweet, dreamy bubble of mutual admiration and understanding."
4353,"The costumes and sets were very believeable and historically accurate. The attention to detail was good; overall it was historically accurate--with some exceptions. Yes, there are jingoistic, drawn out speeches, but they all are moving, are performed masterfully, and flow nicely. Some of the reviews of this picture are hilarious. There are at least three fine speeches by Martha, Jim Lewis and Lawrence Chamberlain bringing out the wrongness of that issue."
4354,"The story is full of remarkable twists and turns constantly forcing the viewers to change their thoughts on who committed the murder. It's not a perfect film by any stretch (as many, MANY critics have been pointing out), but it does grab you and it does deliver. Kate Winslet is the reporter who interviews Gale during his last three days and she is convinced of his guilt and need to be executed, but as she interviews Gale she begins to question his guilt. Meanwhile, Gabriel Mann, Leon Rippy and Matt Craven also provide colorful backdrops to the story at hand with their credible supporting characters. Now on death row for the rape and murder of his best friend, Constance Hallaway (Laura Linney), reporter Bitsey Bloom interviews Gale on his last three days of life."
4355,"One of the greatest movies ever created! Things like "" it's the new animal house "" or "" an instant classic "". But there are plenty of laugh - out - loud moments thanks to the fantastic cast. This has to be one of the funniest movies ever made. Not to mention there really are some gut - busting funny scenes throughout."
4364,"Thus, even though the story has nothing new to offer, the funny moments make' Bringing Down The House' fun to watch. White's character is similar in tone to her excellent supporting role in Lake Placid (1999), although she was underused here. A couple scenes on that end were actually moving. It's an old formula but one that works fairly well here, thanks, primarily, to the assured, high - energy performances of Martin and Latifah in the starring roles. Adam Shankman directs and this is a large improvement over A Walk to Remember."
4365,"The whole visual manner of filming, camera angles, close ups etc adds to the intensity here. The use of Africans as extras was an interesting and a suitable choice, given their backgrounds. A lot of gunfire, explosions and bodies flying through the air. The believability of a commanding officer allowing such violations of orders is very difficult to imagine, to say the least. This movie did a VERY good job of describing awful atrocities without being overly gory or, worse, sensationalist and the use of humiliation and subordination as a weapon was subtly demonstrated."
4369,"The movie is pretty well - produced overall, though there are a couple of glaring editing goof - ups (the knife being dunked into water, for example . ) Here are several reasons for the low scoring reviews, for those of you who thought it was terrific. Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro played expertly off one another. The film story of Aaron Hallum played by the competent Benicio Del Toro and his counterpart, L. T. Bonham, played by Tommy Lee Jones, bring this theme into clear focus. It's always perfectly clear what one location's relationship is to the next location, what and why characters are doing what they're doing, and just what is occurring in the fight scenes--who is injuring who and how."
4390,"The first third of Dreamcatcher is worth the time. The notable exceptions to this where Jonesy and the Beav. And considering you're taking 1000 pages into a 135 page script, that's pretty good to have everything flow together. Filmmakers need to be able to have creative licenses, and that's what Kasdan does. Steve Johnson's work on the puppet versions of the "" s *** weasels "" is extremely effective, and shows, once again, that anything CG can do, human hands can do better."
4391,"Gwyneth Paltrow predictably good indeed and Candice Bergen perfectly cast as the "" big - haired mentor "". His facial expressions, mannerisms, articulation, and speech patterns atone for all of the weaknesses inherent to his character, and Myers' personal style and improvisation attest to his incredible comedic ability. Ruffalo plays the typical love - interest and he has done better in' Just Like Heaven'. There's a lot of hilarious comedy as the characters of the hotties: Kelly Preston, Christina Applegate and Paltrow meet and befriend one another. The romance with Mark Ruffalo is never in the way and provides a nice capper at the end."
4396,"He is able to get a confession out of Dunbar, but as he digs deeper, he only finds more and more prove of contradictions and illegal practices. The plot twists in several ways as each contradiction brings out a bit more truth in the overall tale. Tagged by many critics as overly predictable despite trying to be the complete opposite, BASIC is nevertheless a strong, original and entertaining film. If you watch the film on DVD, there is a really funny extra segment with the screenwriter. The investigation continues well with both of the two men telling their stories, however Hardy finds that the stories contradict themselves and that the truth is much, much more complex than first appeared."
4397,"The Core is certainly one of those movies for which one must suspend disbelief. The opening scene in Trafalgar Square with the crazy pigeons is better than anything in The Day After Tomorrow. Like such doomsday movies as Armageddon, what The Core has going for it are likeable characters and a lot of nifty FX. The sentiments expressed go from being "" Fine Movie "" to "" Worst Movie ever, "" the last obviously coming from someone who rated "" Starship Troopers "" as the "" greatest Sci Fi movie ever made . "" An energy field would do sweet f*ck all to deflect radiation."
4398,"The movie just had it together and there were a lot of great moments. The opening sequence where the credits discuss who is not in the film is hilarious. It's been done many times before, such as ` Dave', starring Kevin Klein, and Warren Beatty's ` Bulworth'. The film certainly has the gags, many of which are genuinely funny. Back in the late 70's and through the early 80's, Richard Pryor made a string of formulaic type movies, the formula being a street-wise black man is unexpectedly placed in a position of great responsibility or privilege for which he is totally unprepared: (Silver Streak, Brewster's Millions, Critical Condition, Bustin Loose)."
4399,"The shooting locations and the sets are fine. And Firth and Bynes were adorable. He is the center of every scene Bynes isn't in, and he carries that weight well. Daphne turns out to be a hit with the poparazi and has a lot of fun. FINAL VERDICT: An entertaining clean, fun film that all ages can enjoy."
4406,"Eddie is so much more than the "" Undercover Brother "", he's a worthwhile superstar! Eddie Griffin's masterpiece standup comendy routine has been perfected! The part about different religions is great. This film will surprise a lot of people with it's honesty and openess. So to make the story shorter PLEEASE Show it to all the people u know 'cause it's a quality Stage Show"
4407,"It's amazing to see how insane yet practical Rydell's (Nicholson) methods are. Adam does a good job as well, both actors worked very well together and actually have great chemistry. It was nice to see Adam Sandler can act. One great thing about this film, which is rare (sort - of) in comedies, is the acting. The acting in this movie is very good, with stars like Adam Sandler, Jack Nicholson, Marissa Tomei, John Turturro, Jonathan Loughran, and many more."
4408,"This film was sitting on the shelf for a couple of years before Lion's Gate released it theatrically. Only a small percentage of people enjoy this stuff, and for those people, this film is a true rivival of classic exploitive horror. Writer / director Rob Zombie's music has always had a kind of comic book / horror movie sensibility which he translates into his screen project, a tribute to the pioneering take - no - prisoners classics of the 1970's like "" The Hills Have Eyes "" and "" Texas Chainsaw Massacre, "" in fact a prominent role is played by Bill Moseley of "" TCM II . "" But for those who are, the film is a true gem and a rarity; it is a kind of film that hasnt been seen on the screens in over twenty years and probably wont be for another twenty years. To see the inevitable Unrated Directors Cut on video is going to be a true horror experience."
4410,"That, and the ludicrous torture machine are the lighter negative aspects in an otherwise entertaining movie, and even they somehow just add to the fun. Don't confuse the movies, and you'll have fun. In USA, he meets the lonely pickpocket Kar (Seann William Scott), and he believes that Kar may be the next protector of the scroll. For both of the young leads to share the power was a great idea (also serving to bond them in their relationship), and it could make for a superb superhero - like sequel, since their fighting skills were radically increased by the power of the scroll. This is some of the more slyly funny material in the film--the HUDs even have an abandoned subway car turned disco in their underground lair."
4411,"You can look at her a thousand times and each time you will will see something new that makes her appear even more beautiful. "" Chasing Papi "" gives her a much better outlet for her talent. Roselyn Sanchez and Jaci Velasquez were also great and they really worked well together and with Eduardo. The movie was obviously attempting to be like one of the classic screwball romantic comedies. The movie is predicable and the dialog is a little lame, but it is entertaining and there are a few surprises."
4412,"O'Hara's reaction to that moment is perfect. The focus on both performers, and the behind - the - scenes people is similar. It is a hilarious take on those performers that were part of the era. The three groups featured in this movie are as good as many of the 1960s groups that actually made a living entertaining. The musical performances are excellent, recreating, almost frighteningly, the taste and texture of folk music of the era."
4413,the way everything was set up and everything had a purpose. It is this well nuanced core that makes everything else in the film believable. Like the palindromic name Stanley Yelnats it begins at opposite ends chronologically and works toward the center. As such it transcends the family movie genera and simply becomes a good film that everyone can enjoy. Shia Lebouf gives a great performance for his first film.
4414,"But the makers, with the amazing Jamie Kennedy in the center of the thing, have gone for the burn, taking an hour and a half to shake out every possibility of the concept. All the actors did a pretty good job in their parts. But if the film has a great duo like Chris Farley and David Spade, the antics speak for themselves. Malibu's Most Wanted is one of those films that leaves you feeling funny and stupid all together but has some hilarious scenes and can be enjoyed by anyone who prefers this brand of comedy. One note though, they should've made Snoop Dogg's dialogue more like the way he really talks / raps."
4426,"This may be the defining role of Edward Burns' career, and likewise for Rachel Weisz. James Foley's patterned direction possessed intriguing qualities that contributes positively to the unanticipated plot. You will be consumed with numerous narrative twists. Rachel Weisz fills the part here, and does a decent job at it. In a tight spot, Jake agrees to do a con and split the proceeds with the King, to get him off his back."
4434,"This is a film that offers a magnificent nuanced performance from Mr. Hoffman. Owning Mahowny was one of the best films of 2003, and should not be missed. As he falls deeper into the casino's pockets, the hotel owners fall deeper in love with his freelance style, and Dan is soon treated with celebrity like status upon every visit. Hoffman gives a yeoman's if not overly subdued performance as Dan Mahowny, and the film for the most part is a better than average watch. Mahowny has just become promoted to being a bank manager and he is very good at his job."
4427,"Of course the theme of the film, as well as all of the subtexts, has to do with personal identity, and especially veiled personal identity. The cast go a long way to helping this by having quite a few big names as well as pretty good performances. Director James Mangold effectively employs a number of interesting techniques here. The cast is great, the setting appropriately scary - with no short measure of red herrings to keep you guessing. They also explore a more dynamic identity of action, as relationships continually shift throughout the film."
4428,"Demme has done a great job in encapsulating the period from the late 60s to the late 70s. Sometime with a clutch of extras. Interviews include the likes of Scorsese, Robert Altman, Sidney Lumet, Julie Christie, Jon Voight, Francis Ford Coppola, Paul Schrader, Pam Grier, Bruce Dern, Peter Bogdanovich, Roger Corman, Dennis Hopper, Robert Towne, etc, and there's a constant flow of insight from start to finish. Directed by Ted Demme, it is obviously a labor of love of the films of the period, but it gives short shrift to the masterpieces of the times. All this narking aside though, this is a very well - made and intelligent film, featuring many interesting filmmakers, and not to be missed by moviehounds - just remember that it only reflects a very small, critically - approved niche of seventies cinema."
4431,"She seems like a real smart down to earth gal with a good head on her shoulders. "" Miss Ungermyer "" and "" Matt "" are very funny. The animated add ins are not nearly as funny as they think they are but they are all part of the charm and energy that made this film watchable. It's good, clean fun, and very entertaining for children and adults alike. But anyhoo, bubbly Lizzie heads to Italy with her classmates to see the sights of Rome, but spends very little actual time with them."
4432,"The highlight of the film was definitely Mystique's transformation scenes, very well done. The recast Pyro is great and Nightcrawler is fantastic. Action wise the film took a major step up from the first film and many of the action scenes are quite simply awesome. The makers of this movie have done a great job in making sure various characters get the right amount of screen time. Ian McKellan, Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Rebecca Romijn - Stamos, Brian Cox, Alan Cumming, Bruce Davison, Anna Paquin, Kelly Hu, Aaron Stanford, Shawn Ashmore, and Daniel Cudmore all did incredible jobs with their roles and should be proud of their work, truly fantastic."
4435,"FINAL VERDICT: Has some funny parts. Other notables pop up in supporting roles, and the kids are terrific. It might be a little hard to get them to do everything you want them to, but obviously they did a great job, because the movie turned out awesome! She is following right in her big sister's footsteps. You really care about these characters, and desparately want everything to turn out well for them."
4437,"Very impressive in the way that it leaves a lasting impression, which good films should. Her performance is beyond brilliant and she single handily carries this movie on her shoulders with her performance. All three, and especially Rachel Weisz, are convincing in their roles, and deliver multi-layered performances with lots of subtext. It is quite apparent that LaBute has the same mentality--but take that as a good thing. LaBute has successfully made all four characters three - dimensional and they feel like real people."
4447,"Rivaling the likes of Star Wars and LotR and that is saying something. The reviewers who feel that the second and third movies were "" deep "" should go see some truly deep movies. Sometimes the scenes are a little lengthy, which harmes the narrative, but that is compensated easily by the visual spectacle. Reloaded is man as a builder of theories and civilizations. Apart from the Zion scene and the Twins not getting enough screen time, this movie was right up there, and for a movie just to sit back in awe and watch all these fighting sequences, car chases and special effects in action, it's a special movie."
4448,"The sets are terrific with the decor for the offices and apartments. The look of the film is nice, as are the costumes and the Big Apple setting. It is sharp and funny bit occasionally bogs down and some of the twists are too obvious. What you can't expect, however, is the sheer fun that ensues, complete with fake New York City backdrops, glamorous period sets, and even more glamorous costumes, makeup and hairstyles. The cast is right on target--Zellweger and McGregor give their all to the performances--they wink at the audience all the time."
4451,"You have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report. Carrey delivers just the right mix of comedy with a touch of the Spirit. Jim Carrey gives another great performance as Bruce Nolan. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, as always Morgan Freeman is first - rate and seems right at home as God and the cast brings the plot together well. As you probably know from hearing about this movie in the first place, Carrey's pitch - perfect acting stays in character (which, luckily enough, is him), and controls and gives atmosphere to the movie scene by scene."
4453,"And the voices are cast perfectly as well. Note the masterwork that occurs as an upbeat, jovial number quickly escalates into something darker in a matter of minutes. The most excellent thing about "" Finding Nemo "" is the perfect timing, just like in "" Monsters, Inc "" the jokes are extremely well placed in a quick pace and are good for more then just a few laughs. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. Pixar Studios have done it again."
4454,"It features a "" cool "" cast with Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Seth Green and Jason Statham. The action is very nice, the landscapes and Venice are real eye - candy, the story is OK and the special effects are stunning. Mos Def, Jason Steadham, Ed Norton, Seth Green and Charlize Theron all turn in solid, fat - free performances. Mark Wahlberg (Charlie Croker), Charlize Theron (Stella Bridger), Donald Sutherland (John Bridger), Jason Statham (Handsome Rob), Seth Green (Lyle), Mos Def (Left Ear) and Edwin Norton (Steve) really did a good job. If you like fast paced action movies, this is the one to see."
4455,"There's a big difference between the version shown in theatres and the unrated version: as usual, the theatre version is cut a lot, leaving out some pretty gruesome scenes that are not for the squeamish or faint - at - heart. The other cast members, Jeremy Sisto, Lindy Booth and Kevin Zegers, are all great actors, but they don't have really much to work with here since their characters are basically wasted, though Emanuelle Chriqui really stands out and plays the supporting female lead role very good and convincing. Stan is a special effects master who has created scary monsters for some great flicks: Alien, Predator, Artificial Intelligence, Edward Scissorhands, Chiller, The Hand and more. Wrong Turn is a great throwback to the classic horror movies of the 70's and 80's, with the an excellent production budget which a lot of the older classics simply could not afford to have. Dushku is strong and emulates some of her ` Buffy the Vampire Slayer' character, Faith in her portrayal here."
4456,"What followed the investigation was the loding of so many charges against each defendant as to constitute an extraordinary episode of overcharging. Based on a U. S. Post Office investigation leading to a search of the Friedman's Great Neck, N. Y. home it is immediately clear that the pater familias at the least was a dedicated, devoted collector of sickening homosexual kiddie porn. With emotions running so high on both sides of the issue and the consequences so devastating for all the parties involved, the film at least shows that convictions in such cases must be pursued with the utmost rationality, rigor and care. This is rich, complex stuff, and the filmmaker doesn't put his own views into the film. An expert debunker of many such cases is on screen to offer her views."
4457,"The crowning hilarity regarding the race scenes was that a) the cars apparently needed nitrous to reach 100mph, and b) When they hit the nitro the cars went into hyperspace. The Fast and the Furious was very original with great conflicts, it wasn't as fun as "" its sequel "", but it was awesome as well. The speedometers got more close - ups than some of the cast members. It has a better plot, expanded action scenes, and so on. As far as the racing scenes go, "" 2 Fast 2 Furious "" is pretty good."
4534,"Every scene with him or Geoffery Rush is brilliant. She is quite momorable in this role, and is a great jump for her evergrowing popularity. Jack Sparrow's first arrival on the scene (with total aplomb aboard a steadily - sinking boat) is a prime example, as indeed are the vast majority of subsequent scenes involving this character. and the grinning skeletons come into view, with Badelt's pounding score keeping time to the beat of their maniacal deck - swabbing. The stunts are energetic, highly satisfactory, * not * computerised, and on occasion even carried out by the stars: -) The other saving grace of the production is its humour - not that there aren't a few over-arch knowing references, but on the whole it manages to send itself up without suspending disbelief in the process."
4509,"Dumb and Dumber is a classic, this is a pile of steaming doggy doo doo's. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels were excellent in the first film and in a different league to the two actors in the roles as the young Harry and Lloyd (the guy cast as Lloyd does look like Carrey, except for the blue eyes). The running time is also a good thing as its only 82 minutes long though sometimes it feels longer."
4510,"Everyone is constantly on their cell phones. There are guest stars galore in this movie and it was fun to spot Smoky Robinson doing a bit part as a cabbie. While this movie wasn't perfect nor Oscar performing, it rates kudos for its experimental success in bringing more to the screen and braving new quality attempts at good movie - making. The most obvious aspects that make the film work so well are the extracurriculars. In fact, the funniest thing is that some people took it seriously and enjoyed it as a serious action movie."
4511,"It's got a simple premise, a cute story, engaging leads, and an interesting story with more than a handful of laughs. Production value is par, the chemistry is just so - so, the ending is clever and twisty, and the sum of the parts is something which will be most enjoyed by sentimental romcom junkies. The part with the Flamingo Dancers was funny, and it had a great script. This is a decent, worthwhile movie, even though it could have played it for even greater drama and laughs. Adam (Wilson) is heading to the fictional island of St. Charles, located near Maine."
4546,"The kids fare much better in general, and their musical performances are their real strengths (unsurprisingly). Again, the musical theater numbers are first rate and well thought through. They are really enjoyable â€“ both the well known ones and the new songs; they fit in well with the narrative and act as good bits of punctuation. The fun moments are fun and much of the humor is cute and the "" oh no she didn't moments "" are equally satisfying. His performance is solid and at times very strong (he has a wonderful voice) if not lacking due to the uber - predictable script."
4514,"Everything about this movie looks good. The stunts are not just amazing, they are "" over the top "". So let's just say that, if you're three years old this movie rocks! It had stunts, action, comedy, great acting (within the parameters of what the movie intended), great dialogue (again, within the parameters of what the movie intended) and moved at an excellent pace. If you're into a fast and fun movie, filled with lots of action, noise and over-the-top scenes, then Charlie's Angels is for you!"
4530,"This pays tribute to the source material's pulp origins as well making an impressive visual statement. Special kudos goes to Timothy Squyres, who does one marvelous job of creating an editing similar to a comic's design. He was interested in the tie - in products filling the shelves in all the stores on release. First, Ang Lee's film is extremely faithful to the comics. Overall, Hulk is a refreshing change from standard and bland superhero movies."
4531,"It had a funny central idea, more than a few solid laughs, and a really entertaining lead character. Well, in some time, corrupted politicans are defeated, and blondes reign supreme, although it is hard to believe they are able to actually comprehend what they were fighting for. As virtually every other reviewer on the planet has noted, the original' Blonde' had some amusing moments, most of which were supplied by Ms. Witherspoon, who managed to inject the character of Elle Woods with a believable combination of ditziness and sweet charm. Of course it was a by - the - numbers plot line as predictable as Oregon rain, but Witherspoon, et al played it lightly and for laughs and it worked. For every brilliant sequel like' Aliens' or' Godfather: Part II', there are dozens of painfully lame successors."
4532,"Anyway, "" Sinbad "" truly deserves to be seen and enjoyed! it's got humor, tones of adventure, great plot, really interesting stuff going on, lots of well - known "" voices "" and it's extremely exciting. Good production by Jerry Katzemberg, David Geffen who along with Steven Spielberg constituted Dreamworks. Film obtained much success likeness to previous motion picture Â¨ Treasure planet Â¨, both of them achieved quite money at the box office. The drawing was on time, the voices were great and the adventure was mesmerizing."
4533,"The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Director Jonathan Mostow certainly makes the most of his mega-budget, and delivers plenty of jaw - dropping mayhem along with loads of impressive special effects."
4535,"LXG is a pleasant film that could have been truly extraordinary. Still, it is an enjoyable (if long) two hours, and the attention to detail of the sets, costumes and scenery make it almost worth it alone. You will see a huge difference, however, in the quality of the Connery Bond movies and LXE. Wikipedia is a good start) now to the other reason 2. Nemo's fights would have been among the most spectacular, had they been slowed down to a speed a normal human could see."
4536,"Each sub-story revolves around a profound change. One of these days others will see the light. The performances are all outstanding, especially Nolte and Woods. That's what makes Northfork so great: it's so out of the ordinary and yet so simple and plausible. ` Northfork' definitely requires that you be in a certain mood to appreciate and enjoy it."
4537,"It has some intense action sequences. The action sequences were really well done, and there was tons of them. The arguments really reflect from the first one. And Joe Pantoliano makes every movie better. Otherwise it was very funny, due to the amazing chemistry between the two leads."
4538,"Kids will probably enjoy this more than the adults. Watch it with someone who makes you laugh. 85 : 1) transfer (Also sharp in Pan & Scan transfer) and an good - Dolby Digital 5. The film's plot is surprisingly good but you wish, there is more laughs at times. The answer surprisingly is quite well, although the film does have flat spots and gags that somewhat misfire."
4543,"Things keep moving, stunts every few minutes, explosions, gunfire, jumping off tall buildings, dazzling neon explosions, all accompanied by Alan Silvestri's booming soundtrack music. Let's hope the next installment has the same action, fast paced locations and even more realism in the storyline. Ms. Jolie has done some fine work here. Overall a more good than bad - 7/10 The movie's running time is 117 minutes which is a bit longer then the original."
4544,"Then there is the first rate cast to fully form the emotional complexities that Seabiscuit provides. An extremely rewarding journey though the lives of man and beast. As a film, revolving around the inspiring story of Seabiscuit, it works well. This was a time when people had superiors and recognized it by calling them Sir and Mister. ' This is certainly a reason why Gary Ross's Seabiscuit tugs so effectively at the heartstrings."
4545,"Pretty much all the cast are good fun and their performances are about as hammy and fun as you can imagine. In the first two, they give decent performances but, in this one they were awful. Stallone hams it up and has good fun even if his multiple personalities don't totally work. The sheer sense of fun that Rodriguez brings to it is infectious and makes for a great 90 minutes with the kids. They have proved to be extremely flexible with mediocre budgets and are extremely fun to watch."
4551,"Luckily, the funny moments increase a bit in the final stretches of the movie. Joining the cast again are Seann William Scott as the funny Stifler and a hilarious Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad. Jim again has some great comedic moments, Jason Biggs by now has perfected the role of Jim. Seann William Scott, in fact, steals the show as Stifler, providing an over-the-top manic energy that is both endearing and infectious. Eugene Levy, Fred Willard and Deborah Rush have good moments in the film."
4552,"With a recipe as rich as these ingredients suggest, one's expectations are set to a higher standard. The colorful, in - your - face awfulness of "" From Justin to Kelly "" was a picnic compared to the leaden, meandering awfulness of "" Gigli . "" Nothing was expected of these other entries, but Gigli had the star power of the two most talked about celebrities in Tinseltown. Broadly it's supposed to be a romantic comedy, sort of Out of Sight meets Rainman meets Whats New Pussycat? Ben plays Gigli, an accent challenged goon who is as believable as Madonna in a nuns uniform, and Jennifer plays Ricky, a lesbian gangster who is primarily hired to ensure that Gigli doesn't screw things up."
4555,"Their acting was so real, their expressions so priceless. But ten minutes later, the magic began. Overall, Freaky Friday is a likable, pleasant 90 - minute diverter. Just based on her performance "" Freaky Friday "" was a great ride. This movie deserves all high ratings."
4556,"S. W. A. T. (2003) *** Colin Farrell, Samuel L. Jackson, Michelle Rodriguez, LL Cool J, Josh Charles, Jeremy Renner, Brian Van Holt, Olivier Martinez, Reg E. Cathey, Larry Poindexter, Ashley Scott, Denis Arndt, Reed Diamond, Lucinda Jenney. First off, the performances are great. This film has a nice gradual build to its eventual payoff and Colin Farrell and Samuel L. Jackson are in good form. Their only hope is the newly formed SWAT team, headed by Samuel L. Jackson. S. W. A. T. may be the best action film since THE TRANSPORTER."
4557,"It's a great satire on both the French and American cultures and their nuanced differences. The delicious Leslie Caron plays Madame de Persand with great panache. The rest of Le Divorce's cast includes some very good actors like Glenn Close, Sam Waterston, Stockard Channing, Stephen Fry, Matthew Modine, and the aforementioned Leslie Caron. Ms. Johnson, who has lived in France for quite some time, is an observant of that society. Stephen Fry, Stockard Channing, Sam Waterston, and the rest of the French and American cast do a good job."
4558,"The quality, subjects, waves and angles of the surfing photography are fantastic. The joyous fulfillment and camaraderie radiated by the exuberant folks in this film is infectious. This film offers amazing footage and it's accompanying glorious scenery (and sometimes, not so glorious) and interviews from more than just the most well - known surfers. And, even for the non-surfer, it can be appreciated on the level that you may feel this way about something you participate in, whether it be another sport or activity altogether. The surfing footage is unbelievable, it puts most special effects to shame, yet this is the real thing."
4567,"Robert Englund's as funny as ever, and Ken Kirzinger is a capable Jason. It helped bring back classic 80's horror. Freddy Vs. Jason wasn't complete garabage, it was okay. The commercial success of "" Freddy vs. Jason "" also proved that there's still enough life in both of these characters to justify more sequels. Sure, it would have been nice to have long time - Jason - actor Kane Hodder in this movie, but Ken Kirzinger did a very good job."
4568,"He seems to have found his mark as a directer with this genre. Luna (Button) and Benrubi (Mose) are both destined for greatness. Indeed, part of the great success of Open Range is the way it single - mindedly sustains an atmosphere of fateful suspense. Costner has a great feel for creating and choreographing complex action scenes. After the highly successful Dances With Wolves (1990) he directed with Kevin Reynolds - albeit in uncredited fashion - the critically mauled The Postman (1997)."
4570,"It brings back memories for some and insight for all. For example, immediately following a sequence with Paul Giamatti as Pekar, the film cuts to the set where the scene was shot. Giamatti's performance alone is worth the time in watching this film. The other incredible casting is the one of Hope Davis as Joyce Brabner. As Pekar, Paul Giametti turns in a flawless performance, capturing the nebbishness, cantankerousness and ultimate likeability of the man he is portraying."
4571,"The special effects are cool and the stunts are fairly good. Entertaining and seriously funny, seven out of ten stars. There is great chemistry between Frankie Muniz and Hilary Duff. Director Herald Zwart brings a lot of flair to this film as the film is shot beautifully and never looks cheap or boring. The script by Ashley Edward Miller, Zack Stentz, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karaszewski is never boring and never loses your interest when nothing is happening."
4598,"Willim Dafoe gives a great and chilling performance, Ruben Blades is in top form and Eva Mendes is cold but hot none the less. It is an incredible Spanish track, worth watching the entire credits! As expected in a Rodriguez film, the action scenes are very well - choreographed and all possess a certain slickness and originality. Pedro ArmendÃ¡riz Jr. gave a decent performance as the president. There is a complex and engaging story to follow, complimented by some riveting action scenes and classy dialogue."
4625,"Better yet, it should the "" E "" man; Emeril Lagasse. He does his Stifler thing again and it's good. Engaging, high - energy action scenes, enthusiastic performances, and moments of genuine humor make this a blast from start to finish. There are no twists and turns of any really note but the important thing is that it is nicely paced it has a nice glossy sheen to the cinematography. This is a highly entertaining flick, bringing back pleasant memories and is one of the best action films in years."
4593,"Undoubtedly, those qualities will turn off a great deal of viewers, whether because they hate MTV / attention - deficit - disorder - styled editing, genre hopping or a lack of real - world believability. Jackie Chan fans seeking a return to films that are solely kung fu - oriented will likely be disappointed, but if you have broader tastes, The Medallion might hit the spot. The final showdown between the starring and nasty contenders is astounding and overwhelming although there are made by computer generator FX. While The Medallion is certainly not a film without flaws, it is satisfying on the whole if you approach it as a comic book / cartoon - styled Jackie Chan actioner. Its a fun fantasy movie for kids, but anyone wanting to watch an action movie should watch this up until a short cameo appearance by Sammo Hung and then turn it off very quickly."
4594,"Victor Salva makes great use of the' surprise element'. Once again Salva delivers good directorial touches and an entertaining story. There's plenty of action, impressive makeup FX, moments of gruesome humor, and tightening suspense to drive it. But credit must be given to director Victor Salva for keeping the whole tale tense and taut with visual excitement. Salva's regular composer, Bennett Salvay, delivers a terrific symphonic score, as brassy and frightening as any in recent years, which serves to boost the film's dramatic appeal in no uncertain terms."
4595,"It is densely packed with clever dialogue, subtle puns and other kinds of literary devices and references. Visually, Helgeland creates and sustains an incredible eerie atmosphere throughout the film. Alex, Thomas, Mara Sinclair (Shannyn Sossamon), William Eden (Benno Furmann), and Driscoll (Peter Weller) all seem like real people with complex personalities and back stories. The "" horror "" is subtle at first, but it builds, along with the suspense, into several, intense episodes that culminate the film decisively. The entire cast which, seems to be little more than a Knight's Tale reunion all turn in great performances."
4597,"It has twists, turns, and a big streak of enjoyability running through it. Alison Lohman does a fine job as Angela. The film is one of the great entertainments of the year. It is a nice, technically simple film that follows their more epic, effects, and set piece driven movies preceding them. He was superb in Confessions and looks like he could be a top new star."
4600,"The spark of promise that meeting someone new brings. Certainly fame has great (perhaps greater than disadvantages) advantages but then there are the obligations, the expectations. Coppola simply lets her two amazing leads do the work. It is a love affair not of bodies, but of minds and spirits. just everything evokes the various spiritual awakenings of the characters."
4617,"Articulate, informative and sleazily attractive, he winds up his narrative with, "" Look at the spike. The life of the Tilson family changes after the arrival of Dale, and deep secrets about the former family are disclosed. Out of "" miles "" of home movie footage, a poolside scene featuring this attractive young woman and her daughter in bikinis seems to be especially pertinent. Noted for her cool, chilly roles in films like "" Sliver "", "" Intersection "" and "" Basic Instinct "", here she is a hopelessly edgy bundle of nerves who squeals and screams every time anything unexpected happens like someone coming to the door or coming out of the water and having someone at the edge of the pool! The Green Acres Four treat themselves to an unauthorised viewing of a crumbling country estate that's been foreclosed by the bank."
4618,"He holds his own with legends Caine and Duvall from the word go. The surprises are what make it so special. Haley Joel Osment delivers a solid portrayal of Walter. There are no plot tricks, just eye - widening revelations as the story unfolds at a satisfying pace. Writer / director Tim McCanlies shows real potential here and Osment continues to amaze."
4619,"The production design, lighting, and cinematography are all excellent and the DVD has some great features explaining these aspects of the production. The wonderfully unique bullets used by both sides are absolutely brilliant. Bottom line, if you like the genre, appreciate stylish production design, and think highly of Ms. Beckensale you should make it a point to see this movie. Although the small action scenes work very well, the more elaborate scenes are disjointed, confused, and somewhat silly. This was because it is first and foremost a Kate Beckensale's vehicle, as emphasized by recent trailer for the sequel."
4624,"At first, as is always the case, everything seems nice and dandy. Put this on last night not know anything about it and was pleasantly surprised. Stiller and Barrymore worked well together and had a good chemistry, and it was a nice surprise to watch a comedy without too many attempts at silly slapstick. It's always nice to find a simple, pleasant comedy amidst the horde of mainstream moneymakers released every year. In Danny De Vito's "" Duplex, "" Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore play a young couple who buy a "" dream apartment "" in Brooklyn whose amenities include everything two upwardly mobile yuppies could possibly want: ample space, solid wood floors, three glorious fireplaces, and, above all, a quiet environment where Alex, a budding novelist, can spend his days writing in uninterrupted peace and quiet."
4627,"The costumes accurately reflect historical reality. The scenery, sets and costumes are all first - rate. The costumes, scenery, music, acting, and characters all compliment the film nicely. All in all, this is a very emotional film which works on so many levels and it was a great pleasure to watch. The film is worth seeing for its visual splendor (in both performance and sets) alone, and certainly as an introduction to a complex historical topic."
4628,"Isabel Coixet led everything wonderfully, and the entire cast is magnificent (even Scott Speedman is pretty good). This is where Mark Ruffalos character, a considerate and thought - provoking love - interest, makes an entrance. All the performances are spot on (even Debbie Harry is great against type), and it's full of humour, not black death - defying humour but the life - affirming humour of everyday life. The story, although dealing with a delicate theme, is very beautiful, sensitive, positive and never corny, due to the sensibility of Isabel Coixet. The two young girls (Jessica Amlee and Kenya Jo Kennedy) are amazing, being very natural and convincing in their performances."
4629,"It's fun seeing the Sherminator have a big part. Standout performances by Patrick Renna, Tony Denman, Danielle Fischelle, Tatiyana Ali, and Boti Bliss (as the prostitute), make this film well worth seeing time and time again. The performances from the cast, all of whom have very little to actually do, are all OK. First off, the plot is all over the place and can't follow all the multiple "" misunderstandings "" very well at all. The Fantasy Girl in the Extra is the best part of the DVD."
4631,"The rendering is a true tour - de-force. What a wonderful surprise "" Les Triplettes de Belleville "" is! The intentional exxageration in the proportions of the ships and sky - scrapers is amazing and stylish. ' The Triplets of Belleville' is wonderfully unusual in many ways. About how the creator was able to invest such meaning in those simple dark circles set behind thick lenses and the line of her mouth, which modulated between forthright resolve and a gentle satisfaction."
4680,"All three of the principle cast members deliver very sincere and natural performances. Moving up there, he finds the usual pointing and staring and just continues his shut off existence. ' The Station Agent' is a masterpiece of fine acting, with Peter Dinklage, Patricia Clarkson and Bobby Cannavale delivering pitch - perfect, bell - ringing performances. The film has others in it but these three are the core and, with three wonderful leads how could the film have been anything less than it was? However it has a wonderful mood delivered by unfussy direction, a unobtrusive and fitting score, wonderfully written characters and three wonderful lead performances."
4681,"In spite of having a small role, Lisa Kudrow delivers the best performance. It does manage to create the feel of the early 80s that ended the craziness of the 70s. In fact, the entire cast turned in amazing performances in this vastly under - rated movie. What it does so well is place a marker on the people who were involved in that massacre (both the victims and the murderers). One such job was a robbery and murders at Laurel Canyon in 1981."
4677,"Sanaa Lathan is also good as is John Billingsley as Matt's slobbish friend. It seems real, with likable characters portrayed by a strong cast, including John Billinglsey as Chae, Matt's best friend who shows up when he's needed the most. His acting is still fine, but the film as a whole wasn't up to Washington's standards. Eva Mendes that saucy Latin minx is also good as Denzels ex-wife who becomes suspicious of his increasingly nervy and strange behaviour. The big name cast are sexy and do reasonably well with the little they are given and director Franklin injects more pace that it probably deserved and the end result is a solid enough little film but not one that really does anything special."
4678,"The children were very talented, they played instruments and sang so well it was impressive and you had no choice but to smile. The children are all talented, particularly the ones on instruments and vocals. Dewey's spirits are lifted when he realizes that there are some talented musicians in the class including Zack (Joey Gaydos, Jr.), the lead guitarist; Katie (Rebecca Brown) on bass; and Lawrence (Robert Tsai) on keyboards. Still, it might be nice to come across the unexpected sometime (after all, movies like "" Dr. Strangelove "" and "" MASH "" were able to do it). The humor quotient of the film is heightened by the funny performance of Joan Cusack as the uptight and unlocked principal of Horace Green Elementary School."
4679,"Photography is great, and the documentary aspect of the movie really unfolds into a bigger event that makes you feel that you are as much a part of the event as the musical stars themselves. Surviving Beatles Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr are here as well as musicians who recorded with the Beatles, Billy Preston and Klaus Voorman. This is a good film with a great soundtrack that won a Grammy Award but it only saw a limited run in art house theaters and quickly disappeared from the big screen for DVD release. George used the stage name' Carl Harrison' in the early 60's because he liked Carl Perkins so much. Here is an all - star tribute to the late Beatle, George Harrison, who died of cancer a few years ago."
4682,"Linney, Lawrence Fishburne and Tom Guiry offer fine supporting performances. Kokayi Ampah found the perfect, generic, metropolitan lower middle class neighborhoods, buildings and bars. "" Blood Work "" "" Space Cowboys "" and "" Sudden Impact "" all shining examples of this. A bulk of its many awards and nominations, including two Oscar victories, were for on screen performances. Though the film becomes a bit uneven towards the end, this tough, brutal and uncompromising; but still, a masterpiece, and the best work Eastwood as done in years."
4683,"There are people out there who will greenlight anything! See actual video game footage spliced into action scenes that make Ed Wood, Jr. look superior! Jammed into this ghastly disaster is a superabundance of gibberish dialogue, heinous acting, mumbo - jumbo exposition and zillions of clips from the once - popular arcade game of the same name. Lots and lots of pop culture references, including a mention of George A. Romero and the possibility of a 4th "" Dead "" film. The actors seem like they're reading off cue cards as they constantly pause in the middle of long sentences and carry on talking as soon as they see the next card."
4684,"At least two scenes closer to the end of the movie are absolutely hilarious. The Wheezy Joe subplot was fun. This delightful throwback to the Tracy - Hepburn, Grant - Russell comedies of the 30's and 40's moves at a nice pace and is anchored by a razor sharp performance by Clooney, who has rarely been more appealing on screen. The stars are deliriously attractive, the story has a few surprises along the way and the film is very easy on the eyes and often entertaining to the ear. The supporting cast is great here with Rush (in a surprisingly tiny role) hamming it up well and Thornton presenting another one of his oddball characterizations."
4685,"The stringing together of the scenes was impeccable. Simply amazing : 10 stars out of 10. Mr. Quentin Tarantino is rather extreme, yes, and it's lovely! The music and lyrics that accompany the scenes are astounding. However it was also so much more, with one of the great sections of the movie being presented in Japanese animation."
4686,"Her very expressive eyes go along way towards silent conversation. The characters are all extremely believable. Checkout Nicole Wilder as Machiko, you can't play cute and sensual any better than that. Overall worth seeing, with some excellent parts, as well as some inconsistencies in quality of scenes. This is a great movie, however a few minor details could have made it better."
4687,"The sets and costumes (as you would expect) are all letter perfect and there are as many sight gags as there are funny lines. However, there is something a bit' off' with it: It seems to take place in the 1970's and there is some hint about the "" Bicentenniel Room "". c. script makes mincemeat of every target. That the framework of the film makes all of these developments seem perfectly natural and realistic is a credit to director and writer Richard Day. Equally strong is Coco, as rendered by Clinton Leupp, who turned Trick into something watchable as the ` acid queen' in the celebrated bathroom scene."
4688,"Weisz played the female lead with the right mix of the strong and vulnerable. Leading you in multiple directions, the constant game of' cat and mouse' is brilliantly played out with some noticeable surprises as well as some rather unexpected ones. Cusack is able to do almost anything, Hoffman and Hackman are always reliable actors and sexy Weisz is perfect as the mysterious Marlee. Hackman, Weisz and Cusack are all on top form for this one, but Hoffman's Character seemed to lack a little depth. The Good: Some of the performances are spectacular and deserving of a much better movie than this."
4689,"Well - filmed, well - acted, suspensful, with good characters. The cast, leaded by the delicious Jessica Biel, have good and convincing performances. One of the great moments of 70's shock cinema. She's quite excellent here; as it was for the original TCM's Marilyn Burns, Biel's performance is exhilarating and intense--a kind of endurance test. Obviously the film had some advantages from a bigger budget, and R. Lee Ermey is definitely worth watching."
4690,"And it's enjoyable on many different levels--it's funny, charming, weird, intelligent, and it has a real honest heart to it that isn't nearly sentimental or gushing. It's full of tiny details of behavior that make the characters feel completely authentic, rather than creations. "" Pieces of April "" is a gem to be discovered by sensitive viewers. And at least those made - for - TV - flicks have better camera - work than this. The cast is very inspired, highlighting the performances of Katie Holmes and Patricia Clarkson."
4708,"You'll also find excellent performances. It also brings home the incredible responsibility on the shoulders of journalists. The rest of the cast is well padded with famous faces who all deliver well with the little they have. The public - at - large loves a good scandal, and in 1998, the scandal involving Stephen Glass was a pretty darn good one. Peter Sarsgaard, Chloe Sevigny, Steve Zahn, Rosario Dawson - they're all excellent (which they've all proved in other movies as well)."
4691,"moment by moment she projects her feelings thoughts. He superintended the posthumous publication of "" Ariel, "" one of Sylvia's most enduring legacies. The relationship came across as quite two dimensional, and even pretty one sided on the part of Paltrow / Plath. The dialogue and Paltrow and Craig's faces do that very well. A more adventurous structure, with glimpses of childhood, early years, etc might have added much needed lyricism to this lackluster project."
4692,"The film has the right speed in presenting all the facts, it is simple and well acted - Cate Blanchett's performance is outstanding. Cate Blanchett as Guerin is inspired casting, an actress capable of covering all facets of the human condition, and in support Ciaran Hinds, Gerard McSorley and Brenda Fricker give powerful performances. Blanchett definitely breathes life into the Guerin character with phenomenal credibility and vitality, allowing her personality to shine with such unique journalistic dedication, honesty, courage, determination and obsession. Despite being a slightly young choice (only 33), Cate Blanchett was an excellent choice for the title role. Overall, ` Veronica Geurin' is a powerful, rousing fast - based story that leaves an unsurprisingly bad taste."
4693,"Not goody - goodies or baddy - baddies. She and Mark Ruffalo give the most stunning lead performances for a long time. 1 - channel sound mix and a nude scene that is notable not for its pornographic or fantasy - fulfilling qualities but for its stark realism. And how much of love involves physicality, carnality, trust, the desire to dominate, the desire to be dominated, and above all, the attraction of the DANGEROUS. 1 - channel surround than sticking a few whizzing noises in the rear channels when a spaceship flies off the top edge of the frame."
4694,"First of all, Gooding's and Harris's performances were simply spectacular, especially Gooding. It's perfectly well acted by Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. . The story is filled with unexpected twists which keeps the viewer at all times from figuring the ending out. The scenes between Jones and this woman, lovingly played by S. Epatha Merkerson, are some of the finest in the film. It is beautiful to see how the movie goes to the highest joys, the lowest lows, and just seeing Radio live his life."
4695,"' Scary Movie 3' is a lot more enjoyable than its prequels. With some famous actors like Charlie Sheen and Leslie Nielsen, who both have a solid record full of humorous TV - series and / or movies, you know that you can expect the best of the best again when it comes to this kind of humor. Of course you'll recognize several famous movies again. Zucker actually manages to bring some class in this third film and there is quite a convincing plot that smartly combines Verbinski's' The Ring' and Shyamalam's' Signs'. Get an idea for the genres, directors, actors and so on that you usually enjoy."
4696,"Denahi and Kenai are have much more to them. Every component of it is great, and the scene where Koda discovers that Kenai is really a man is beautiful. When humans are around the usual grunts and growls prevail. Not going to give away the happenings behind this powerful, moving scene. That's right, the songs are strongly tied to the sub-story."
4697,"For them there are plenty of mindlessly upbeat depictions of high school life to watch. The picture features impeccable acting by a group of non-professionals from the Portland, Oregon area. The main protagonists, Alex (Alex Frost) and Eric (Eric Deulen) are modeled after Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold of Columbine. The director has drawn fine work from his cast of talented unknowns. Alex is more outgoing and creative, Eric more passive, but their personalities complement each other."
4698,"In "" The Singing Detective "" there are moments of pure "" Yes! "" Ten years ago Ang Lee made a terrific little movie. Robin Wright Penn, Jeremy Northam, Adrian Brody, Katie Homes and Alfre Woodard among others all deliver top notch supporting performances. Still, towards the end of the film, when Dan starts to make some profound psychological breakthroughs, the fantasy scenes actually do begin to work and the complex structure pays off. , but it seemed instead he must actually have been doing what Bogart himself did: focusing on difficult issues, maintaining deep courage and principles, and finally acting richly with his whole being."
4707,"The length of the film, at 106 minutes, is the perfect length. The pasts of the main protagonists unfold, making their characters exceptionally deep. This is a film that aims high, which makes it's imperfections stand out all that much more. Faunia works part - time jobs as a janitor, a postal employee, and a farmhand. There is a lot of nuance in the way the scenes are filmed and the way in which the actors are framed."
4719,"The cast was full of surprises such as Bernard Hill (great actor but a strange role). What saves the film is the excellent acting of Halle Berry, Penelope, Cruz, Robert Downey Jr., and all the rest of the cast, the haunting setting, and the way the atmosphere is being build. there is some great camera work and some really interesting ideas but gothika doesn't have some of the subtle touches that What Lies Beneath had, but its easy to see some of the parallels between the two films. On the way home one evening, she has to take a detour, and has a supernatural experience that winds up with her being an inmate in the same psychiatric prison, now a patient of her former colleague, Pete Graham (Robert Downey, Jr.). Gothika is easily the best of the lot, and also the darkest."
4709,The Oracle says it clearly in Revolutions. you'll enjoy and perhaps love Revolutions. Most of the secondary cast from Reloaded returns in their parts in Revolutions and they all do decent jobs with their characters. It is action - packed with amazing special effects and the usual above - average acting and amazing creativity in the choreography of the fight scenes. Harry J. Lennix (Lock) improved his character tremendously in spite of limited screen time.
4710,"There's a coup d'etat and a couple of irish documentary filmmakers are right inside of it. What happens before your eyes is stunning, shocking - and if it weren't for the very real events of similar nature in the past in other Latin American countries, unbelievable. And when the people take back control and restore the popular leader, the filmmakers are still on hand with cameras rolling. What you get here is the most fascinating and unique look at historical events ever captured on film: you get to be inside a coup d'Ã©tat in Venezuela while it is actually happening. If nothing else, the film offers an exhilarating ride, well worth the price of a non-matinee ticket, and it will provide plenty of conversation material for afterwards at the coffeehouse."
4711,"The support cast is good with fun turns from Newhart, Asner and Steenburger. Charming Christmas confection--about a boy raised by elves in the North Pole who grows up and journeys to N. Y. C. in search of his biological father--puts a clever spin on even the most familiar gags, successfully walking a fine line between absurdist comedy and holiday schmaltz. Hysterically funny thanks to the goofy yet sweet and wonderful turn by Ferrell (no one else could pull off the razor's edge of looking like an idiot yet retaining the innocent glee of a child and bares a striking resemblance to Tom Hanks' turn in' BIG') with a great cast especially the beguilingly pretty Daschanel as his fellow Santa's Little Helper at Gimbels' who he falls in love with. Ferrell is a natural performer and his dopey wide eyed expressions never grow old. Elf was a hilarious movie about a guy named Buddy (Will Ferrel), who was raised by elves at the North Pole."
4713,"It was a very good combination of experienced ones and some others one had never seen before. There are schmaltzy happy moments and touching sad ones, moments of great strength and moments of foolish weakness. These noble, tragic threads are interwoven with lighthearted comedic ones to produce a fabric that holds together well. And the strength that a third shows when love is shown to be fragile and her world collapses around her is tragically inspiring. And the purely comic moments, like Rowan Atkinson's appearances and Hugh Grant's Christmas - caroling bodyguard, are delightful in and of themselves."
4715,"So 25 years after his father's death, at the age of 36, Nathaniel set out to make this film to find out who his father was - and he has done an amazing and triumphant job. The movie is full of interviews, many quite wise and spiritual. ' Wares then speaks about Kahn's achievement and character. I. M. Pei makes one thing emphatically clear: he considers Kahn his superior. In India, where he built the Indian Institute of Management, a former co-worker describes him as a guru."
4716,"Undoubtedly O'Brian novels form a fine background for the excellent screenplay. , to the intricate chain of command, to the sheer power of the battle scenes. The adaptation by Weir and John Colley is right on target, brimming with great characters and scenes. The production values are very high and the dialogue and length allow the director a better than average framework for character development. It's a place where both close friendships and deep resentments can grow, and the tension in the air at times feels like a living presence."
4717,"The locations are stunning, and the soundtrack is very powerful. Just some well placed ambient music which supplemented the scenes nicely. The characters are slowly developed in a very consistent way, and have outstanding performances of Cate Blanchett (as usual), Tommy Lee Jones and the starlet Jenna Boyd. But here, the characters of Cate Blanchett and Aaron Eckhart realistically consider their behavior to be decent and civilized. Predictably excellent performances from Cate Blanchett, Tommy Lee Jones, and a fantastic performance from Eric Schweig as the Apache witch doctor."
4718,"The opening credits are clever, the kids are charming and the production values are top notch. The sets are beautiful, almost a perfect rendition of what most people think a three - dimensional version of the Seuss universe would look like. The sets and props were very appealing, giving the viewer a much needed distraction from the bad writing, direction, and Myers. He can be very funny when his energies are applied where they belong, comic sketches. With movies like "" Elf "" and "" Brother Bear "" currently in theaters, you have far better choices."
4720,"This is certainly one of Arcand's best movies with Jesus of Montreal and Le declin. Denys Arcand is so very astute on all these fronts and wrote a fantastic screenplay for the wonderful cast of characters. What follows is both a comic and a touching critique of the achievements of socialism. He deserved that Oscar if not for this movie for one of those 3 movies. Money gets Remy out of an overcrowded ward, it gets him the most accurate medical tests and the "" painkillers "" he needs to survive."
4721,"The casting is brilliant, and the chemistry between all the characters is very much present. Terry Zwigoff has transformed the crumbs of society into a sophisticated, adult, art form. As with all good comedies, the material is inspired but it's the delivery that makes it unforgettable. Billy Bob Thorton is masterful as is the rest of the cast. His performance alone would be enough to make this film good but the fact that his high standards are maintained by the rest of the cast elevates it to a classic."
4722,"The sets were beautiful and intricate, the costumes and make - up are gorgeous and the special effects are amazing. The best thing about the Haunted Mansion is that it had pretty good special effects. With his deep rumbling British accent, Stamp gives a deliciously over-the-top performance, and he does here what Johnny Depp did for' Pirates of the Caribbean'. In the end, this is a fun movie for kids, and amusing for adults, with fun references, and a fun performance by Murphy and the kids. Not as good as' Pirates', but a fun ride nonetheless."
4723,"The story boils down to a pretty standard chase and explosion thriller set in the middle ages. To find something from someone you know in the present and know that it is over 600 years old and then discovering that he is stranded in an earlier time is very intriguing. The females leads (Frances O'Connor as Kate and Anna Friel as Lady Claire) could have been better. A scene where O'Connors' Kate breaks down crying will have people laughing. Overall the acting was good, however Paul Walker would probably benefit from a few more classes."
4853,"Next thing he knows it is three years later and the job done. The catch is that the whole procedure will take three years. However the action is still pretty good, not quite classic Woo but full or good touches. The film has a good steady pace to it and it keeps it up for the majority - very quickly getting through the set up and jumping to three years hence. The cast is so - so despite having a surprising amount of famous faces."
4836,"Wonderful performances all over, especially by Baldwin and Macy. The performances take the film to the next level. Despite the odd weakness in the material, these are almost totally covered by a superb collection of performances. The cooler here is Bernie and the face of William H. Macy is perfect for him. And Baldwin is the hurricane force wind that rages and storms through the proceedings."
4838,"You've got good vibes coming from all over this movie. Mekhi Pfifer is good in his supporting role as the barber with a lot of heart. Missy Elliott is genuinely funny in her very brief scenes. This isn't really the best vehicle for her, to be honest, but Jessica's an undeniable charmer on screen, and far too sexy for this or anything she's been in (with the arguable exception of "" Paranoid "") to be an unbearable experience. Pros: - Jessica Alba is likeable - The Dancing is good and frequent - Missy Elliott, Tweet and other hip hop stars can be seen in cameo roles."
4839,"The action, sets, scenery and story - even the dialogue - were riveting. Clearly, a ton of historical and cultural research and care went into the script, sets, costumes, casting. In spite of this historical epic being "" in vogue "" at present, there were surprisingly few clichÃ© story elements. Philosopher, poet, family man and warrior - Katsumoto wears many hats, and is realized through Watanabe perfectly. All the necessary ingredients are here - beautiful Japanese landscapes and costumes, larger than life battlefield sequences, and eastern philosophy."
4840,"And they both deliver character performances worthy of prizes. Here they come under the guise of hilarious situations and extremely poignant, compassionate moments. Nuances, accents, inflexion of words, smile or gestures are bricks of a magnificent character, touching, warm, credible. The others are, in great measure, parts of funny miracle and ineffable expectation. Ewan McGregor is pure sunshine and Albert Finney gives one of the greatest performances of the year - he * is * Big Fish."
4841,"The glimpse though turned out to be some of the best parts of a very excellent movie. The first is going to see a film that you have so - so expectations for and finding out that it is not only better than expected, but very good indeed. He tones down his mannerisms and plays the role quietly and intelligently. They are arguably the two finest performers living today and they do end up feeding off each other's astronomical talents throughout. With Something's Gotta Give, she puts the pieces of the puzzle together for some first class entertainment."
4842,"That also gives Stuck On You a slightly more serious edge, but one that works very well. The Farrelly Brothers' "" Stuck On You "" is sincere drama with lots of heart--of course, along with their smart quips and earnest observations not diminishing. That is apparently the case with Stuck On You, the Farrellys latest and tamest, but it's also one of their sweetest and funniest films to date. The magic of Stuck On You is that its protagonists are always the same throughout, making no genuine "" it's a miracle! "" Whilst the film does have humour--some movements hilariously funny--this film is at heart a light drama."
4843,"It was really incredible how precise everything is. It was a perfect movie for someone interested in art. The art direction beautifully recreates Holland of the period and Scarlett Johansson gives a very well - tempered performance as young Griet. The reconstitution of Delftt in the Seventeenth Century is amazingly perfect, being based on paintings of that time. Despite the domestic havoc it caused, the collaboration between artist and subject resulted in one of the genuine masterpieces of the art world."
4844,"Ciaran Hands, Frank Finlay, Charlotte Rampling, Alan Bates, among others, help make this thriller look real. In France in the late 1980s and early 1990s there were several prominent cases of Vichy - era collaborators who were belatedly brought to justice by the French court system. There were many nice touches in the film showing the pleasures of French life - gourmet business lunches, for example, and the beautiful scenery of Provence. "" The Statement "" deserves far better ratings than critics have given it. At the same time his soul has been in jail for more than 40 years."
4845,"Most everything has a distinct sound, and it's rare that anything feels out of place. Everything about the film is wonderful. The final scene at the Grey Havens is graceful, touching, stylish. As whole, the Lord Of The Rings is a phenomenon. Watching this has to be among the most uplifting moments one can experience in a cinema."
4846,"Slightly left of center is Ginnifer Goodwin and right of center Julia Stiles. It is a fine drama, one that merits repeat viewings once or twice a year. Julia Roberts plays an art history professor who takes a teaching position at the all - female Wellesly College in the 1950s. Not everything turns out well in this movie, it more closely reflects real life than do many of the modern romantic comedies. The other humans (you know, fellow "" free - thinking "", "" subversive "" "" bohemians "") are played by Julia Stiles, Ginnifer Goodwin, and Maggie Gyllenhaal (who predictably gives the only memorable performance)."
4847,"The calendar becomes well succeeded, making them famous and affecting their lives. Luckily, ` Calendar Girls' boasts an enormously witty screenplay and first - rate performances by its highly gifted cast. Beautifully filmed in the "" ee by gum "" country of Northern England (and with the sun, to boot), this was a real pleasure for the eyes. This charming film provides more genuine, out - and - out laughs than almost any comedy of recent times. "" Calendar Girls "" is a good dramatic comedy, with an interesting screenplay and great performances of Julie Walters and Helen Mirren."
4848,"As an added â€“ and perhaps unintended bonus â€“ much of what McNamara says has a pertinent, timely, almost prescient ring to it, as the U. S. struggles through yet another foreign engagement, this time in Iraq. Educated in the best Ivy League schools, successful leaders in the business world, they were the best and the brightest, the core of John F. Kennedy's administration. Morris is probably the finest, from an intellectual standpoint, documentarian working today in the U. S. 10/10 (because of its enduring archival and current thought - provoking value ) There are a number of parallels to be drawn between what Americans faced during the Vietnam War era and what Americans face now with middle - east conflicts. As a former secretary of defense for John F. Kennedy and then Lyndon Johnson, McNamara was one of the most important figures from the Vietnam War, in charge of things like bombing campaigns and overall military strategy."
4849,"The cinematography was beyond beautiful; indescribably glorious, breathtakingly exquisite in both the colors and movement. The performances alone are worth it. Everything is brought together to create an astonishing emotional impact. This movie is undoubtedly the best of many good ones in the past years. This gigantic actor delivers one of his best performances to date, he has immaculate control over every single aspect of his character, physically and emotionally."
4850,"Theron is a wonder in this--she became Wuornos (who was very unattractive). At the core there's the amazing performance from Charlize Theron, who's deserving of all the praises and the awards she got. It's a movie that drips with exceptional performances, and yet leaves your soul so cold to the core. If Oscar means anything anymore, she deserves that award, hands - down. Theron's physical transformation from the incredibly beautiful woman she is to hard - and - rough looking serial killer Aileen Wournos was just amazing."
4851,"Just as the original did, the remake works because of the antics of the kids. Director Shawn Levy's previous film, JUST MARRIED, was a loud, unpleasant, clichÃ©d bore; in CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN, he redeems himself with a more enjoyable, richer film. Well this also was not a patch on the original, but that said there was nothing wrong with Steve Martin's performance; he does well with the material as indeed do all the performers. When Ashton Kutcher is the funniest thing in your movie, it's time to re-assess everything you hold dear. The film was such a success that two sequels were made, and Webb would do several more' family' comedies before his death in 1966."
4852,"That, indeed, is beautifully captured by the expressions on Law and Kidman's faces. They exhibit their superb non-stop performing talents in this film with their onscreen appearances. It's beautifully crafted, assembled, and absolutely mesmerizing in all aspects of filmmaking techniques and style. She, Law and Kidman are definitely worthy of being recipients of the Oscar statuettes. Now he showed a lot of emotion in his face during his trials."
4854,"There are some moments that are literally breathtaking. The movie is highly stylised, which works brilliantly, and very rarely has any cringe - worthy moments. All production values are top shelf and belie the enormous budget. Gifted with a luminous smile and physicality, he captures all the radiant cockiness, the self - delighted impishness of undefeated, indefatigable youth. One of the first things you will notice while watching Peter Pan is the incredible production values."
4855,"Altman did a fine job depicting dance, both rehearsals and performances. This is most of all about himself, and is far, far more intelligent and subtle than say ,' Blowup . ' The characterizations are very real, not "" actor - ish, "" from those who * are * actual actors, as well as those who are not. 6/10 Beautiful ballet scenes, A + for putting the dancing centre - stage, so to speak (as opposed to the tawdry melodrama called Centre Stage). The film works like a musical, with ballet numbers popping up throughout the loose narrative."
4856,"The idea that Bush's competency hearing lasting 15 minutes just makes matters worse. Even if you don't like documentaries you'll enjoy this one! The film deals with Wuornos' horrific background and also with the various hearings and appeals to try to save her life. This is the second documentary that film - maker Nick Broomfield has made about Wuornos. Aided by the phenomenal camera work of Peter Watkins' protÃ©gÃ© Joan Churchill, the two film makers capture the final days of convicted murder (and madwoman) Aileen Wuronos."
4859,"All of them do a remarkable job, especially young Marina Golbahari, who captures the wide - eyed terror of her character with vivid exactness. "" Osama "" is a spectacular film, based on true events, and the interpretation of the amateurish cast is so perfect that sometimes the movie looks like a documentary. A powerful and disturbing film of what life was like under the oppressive Taliban rule. The quote by Shariati is in fact very suggestive, and ambiguous in the context of the movie. In accordance with the interview of the director Siddiq Barmak in the Extras of the DVD, Marina Golbahari was accidentally discovered four days before the beginning of the shootings."
4871,"All of the performances are very good. Appearances by Jack Black, David Cross, and Bob Odenkirk are well - placed within the various stories that unfold. "" Melvin Goes to Dinner "" is a fast paced adaptation directed by Bob Odenkirk. All of the characters become more aware of themselves through their interactions over dinner, but it is Melvin who benefits the most. It was a refreshing movie in which the writer, Mr. Blieden, has opened up the play in a satisfying way."
4896,"Their accomplishment in scaling Siula Grande has not to date been duplicated. There is action, sadness, hope, and even brilliant humour in places. Both classes have in common (usually) Gortex gear, superb mountain scenery and splendid cinematography. The running time is generous and allows Simon to tell his story properly, it is amazing and the sense of impossible odds and the sheer pain involved is brought to the audience very well - even with a handful of people in the audience gasps and' ah' s' were very audible. Harrowing times in the extreme soon present themselves, with amazing camera work accompanied by stark human emotions as life - affecting decisions have to be made in the harshest of conditions."
4899,"As for Steve Sandvoss as Aaron, he was incredible. May you find love and peace in your lives. This was a memorable and flawless effort to show people that love truly knows no bounds, and love is still as beautiful and wonderful as it always was. The nude scenes were superbly crafted as well, and all in were good taste. It does an excellent job of showing how the two lead males come to terms with one another, while managing to grow up and develop more fully as individuals."
4901,"In the year 2004, one of the best cinematic experiences is offered by Bertolucci. This description fits The Dreamers like a glove. It often shows how feelings are condensed in a quiet but explosive mixture. All others, be prepared for a marginally interesting watch. "" The Dreamers "" has been released on DVD in Brazil a couple of months ago, and it certainly is one of the best movies of the year."
4906,"It is honest and terrifying, for some they can relate to the pain, frustration, and confusion that the main character goes through but for others it can serve as an eye - opening view of what that life is like. The honesty of the main characters cutting problems is absolutely both terrifying and breath taking. One of the most common criticisms of "" Thirteen "" is that it is' unrealistic'. True talent is shown by the way the characters' complex personalities are so easily understood. Thirteen is one of the more powerful pieces of cinema around."
4922,"There is also the subtle hint of discrimination by both sides against the other. Aside from just being funny in themselves, these bits work doubly well because of their uses of symbolism and metaphor. makes great use of this type of imagery to emphasize the country's transformation and to provide insight to the emotions of the main characters. Even during the most somber parts of the story, the film never lets go of its astute sense of humor; and because the humor is always thought - provoking and cleverly executed, it never feels forced or gratuitous. Once you begin to see the Coca - Cola and Burger King logos, you know that capitalism has truly grabbed hold and that there is now no escaping its embrace, for better or for worse."
4945,"Bettany is very good as are Bacall, Hall, Ivanek, Sevigny and SkarsgÃ¥rd. The power and a sense of opportunity of free use only amplify themselves in Dogvillians. It's a movie that, like all brilliant movies, has themes that transcend into society as a whole. Dogville is a disturbing and powerful film. The people of Dogville are on the surface simple and decent people."
4946,"Yes, this is their interpretation of the story, and it is understandable that true stories require sensationalism and at times the modification of the original plot to grab the viewers attention. There have been quite a number of films based on heroic legends. If you read up the actual history behind most movies based on historical figures, there is usually a huge difference between the fact and the fictional portrayal. There are some beautiful shots of the Australian landscape and the set design and few songs do give a feel of the time. When you consider some other movies that are far worse than this one, your opinion of this movie should be reconsidered."
4954,"What really makes this movie are the beautiful shots of Southern Italy, where golden fields go as far as the eye can see. In discovering the cave where Filippo is hidden, Michele truly discovers a cave "" filled with gems and gold "". This awarded "" Io non ho Paura "" is an unforgettable gem to be discovered by lovers of a great cinema. That is the basis for Director Gabriele Salvatores' wonderful film from the best selling Italian novel, ` Io non ho paura . ' The performances of Giuseppe Cristiano, in a beautiful and morally strong character, and Mattia Di Pierro, in the role of a defenseless victim, are awesome."
4977,"The storyline moves fast, which is important considering the length of this film. Carandiru is the true story of the greatest massacre of prisoners in the world. Despite the crowded and unsanitary conditions, inmates are usually safer and healthier inside rather than out. The book, that is called "" EstaÃ§Ã£o Carandiru "" (Carandiru station - because of the underground station that is nearby) is a success in Brazil. Some other good actors like Milton GonÃ§alves and Caio Blat add more positive points to the production."
4978,"This movie is better than the first reviewer claims. But as it goes on, and strange connections are made between the stories, it seems to have a sudden dreamlike depth to it. â€“ easily the best in the bunch (Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan), "" Delirious "" â€“ the funniest (RZA, GZA, and Bill Murray), and the final one, the elegiac "" Champagne "" â€“ (Bill Rice and Taylor Mead). It's is an easy watch and each vignette has its qualities but as a whole it's a bit of a cheeky movie. Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan are so wonderful as over blown versions of themselves, Coogan as a super arrogant celebrity and Molina as a bumbling, sweet, excitable actor."
5039,"This is one of the most beautiful, touching and human stories of the latest years. Thanks to this masterpiece, Marco Tullio Giordana enters the Gotha of Masters of the "" Made in Italy "" production. In "" La miglior Gioventu' "" Marco Tullio Giordana attempts something quite ambitious: a "" Novecento part 3 "" covering nearly 40 years of Italian history from 1966 to the present day. The screening time hence becomes a non-issue, for it genuinely felt like a sumptuous breeze. Like in the "" Hundred Steps "" the first shots are of hope, with a great imitation of the Technicolor years and the skies of Rome with the "" House of the Rising Sun "" in the background."
5067,"It's every bit as compelling as the Dune miniseries was, and from a technical viewpoint, is actually far superior. A visual feast for the eyes & the heart. Stilgar and Duncan fit perfectly and Jessica is at least Saskia Reeves match. the special effects are in most instances completely seamless and the acting has vastly improved. Steven Berkoff, Barbara Kodetova, Alice Krige, and P. H. Moriarty are solid in their roles, with Kodetova showing improvement over the last miniseries."
5113,"This film is interesting in it's capacity for different interpretations. There are also a few successful surprise - scares in it. The plot is slightly confusing, but some scenes are wonderfully eerie. ' A Tale of Two Sisters', or' Janghwa, Hongryeon', is a true masterpiece. It is also genuinely frightening, with excellent performances from a cast who will be unfamiliar to Western audiences."
5126,"The remarkable natural setting which reflects the wide spectrum of Korea's seasons, which range from hot, sticky humid - fraught summers to icy, cold snow - bound winters, become a metaphor of life with unadorned figures, completely human in form. Yet the world does intrude into the serene hermitage, bringing with it life's pleasures and sufferings. This film is a pastoral poem about the changing seasons and a meditation on the cycle of life. Humor arrives organically, often resulting in hearty laughs. And though the changing of the seasons in the film is to show the life of one monk, Kim says it reflects the cycle of life in general . ''"
5147,"A Danish modern that seems spare and bare bones when compared to other slick art house fare that is out there like "" Vanity Fair "" and "" Bright Young Things . "" Upon his departure Christoffer receives a phone call that his father has hung himself and his presence is demanded in Denmark. Firstly, there's an "" everything is beautiful "" sheen to the world he depicts, manifested in the mock - idyll of the semi-aristocratic environment of its protagonists, the deep bond that connects the family business and the workers they employ, and the actors playing the characters themselves, especially the illuminating Lisa Werlinder. Arven is a superb' European' film. But Anneliese is strong and gets her way and thus the destruction of Christoffer's humanity and life begins."
5201,"The moment works thanks to a nicely subdued and thoughtful performance by Khleo Thomas as the young Mario. Van Peebles' daring use of "" American Splendor "" - like documentary transitions are also wonderfully effective. There were trial and tribulations to get it done, but thanks to a very surprising source the film became a success. The backstage antics are sometimes funny, but more often are simply incredible to believe. Always something of a laughing stock (despite a few good contributions, like a good performance in "" Ali "" and directing "" New Jack City ""), Mario Van Peebles has made himself instantly much cooler by making this fun and suitably chaotic film, which chronicles the making of his father Melvin's landmark film "" Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song ""."
5203,"Haneke is an exceptional filmmaker and has quite an eye. Isabelle Huppert and AnaÃ¯s Demoustier have extraordinary performances. Isabelle Huppert returns as Haneke's star. Haneke's The Time of the Wolf is one of the best of its type ever made. What Haneke shows in minute detail (and in that lies his greatest accomplishment) is that human connection, trust and intimacy is always in some senses based on dominating practices that stabilize the uncertainties and risks of interacting and competing with others in a shared social environment."
5205,The fights in this film make the likes of Kill Bill look even more ridiculous than it does already. The sets are fantastic and really capture the sense of period and place. The cast are roundly superb even where the are let down by the material a little bit in terms of their characters. The local town is plagued by a war between different criminal factions and the protection rates are constantly going up. Into the middle of the impending bloody conflict walks Zatoichi.
5247,"For what reasons and under what circumstances it is unclear, Boad has envied Davy's good times and general panache. The pace and rhythm of the movie and great cinematography accentuates the underlying and half hidden aspects of the script, Clive Owen's acting really proves here that less is more. These films both combine great style, magnetic performances from the currently best British actors, compelling story lines and sense of warmth emanating from perfectly cast protagonists; Owen and Winstone, respectively. He's a man of few words, with a vague history and an undeniable physical presence--in scenes of exposition (particularly the explicit discussions of rape), Hodges conveys Will's delicate internal outrage through a minimum of means. This is a dark, thoughtful piece, less concerned with the usual revenge thriller trajectory than the psychological underpinnings of it's subject matter."
5255,"But it's the sets which are the most beautiful, with a particular attention to lighting, colouring and texturing: many scenes are shot in a golden light, slightly overexposed with lens flares and other atmospheric effects. The world of the gods, by contrast, has a dark, liquid and sticky feel (the gods themselves are liquid, gigeresque creatures) with bright shining reflections, and is truly original. To go along - side the visuals is a great music score by Farid Russlan. The mixture of quasi-photorealism and more traditional CG style works quite well. MOST of the biggest differences between the scenes can be found in the lighting setups, which in some spots are breath - takingly exquisite and at other times amateurish at best."
5262,"The way life is in a typical sleepy smalltown is portrayed perfectly, and the different characters are all funny in their own ways. A funny film with good acting and great jokes. Although this movie is childish and predictable, its content is funny as hell and the actors are perfect for their rolls. "" Kopps "" was a really funny comedy. If you're looking for real comedy and humor, this is the movie to watch."
5263,"Demonized and admired by millions worldwide, Castro is seen as he is today, an aged man with stories and anecdotes that would require volumes to ever capture on film. This documentary is an important effort, now that Fidel Castro â€“ one of the 10 most influential politicians of the last century â€“ is probably close to the end of his life. Stone undoubtedly believes that his film is balanced, and indeed the lack of a voice - over narration allows viewers to listen to the two men talking and draw their own conclusions. The beginning of Commandante â€“ yet another Oliver Stone masterpiece â€“ is similar to the beginning of his epic JFK (1991): lots of archive footage of Castro and Cuba, only this time intercut with masses of frenzied crowds drunk on revolutionary fervour, all shouting' Fidel, Fidel', hailing their great man who is still there in this film, forty years later."
5335,"Afterall, those were very good movies, some of them. The acting was wonderful, especially those who played FrÃ©dÃ©ric, Raoul, and Camille. Of course Ms. Adjani and Virginie Ledoyen play excellent roles - there's just something about those French ladies. The peg for this plot is Frederic, played by brilliant newcomer Gregory Derangere, who is fully up to playing opposite Adjani, Depardieu and Ledoyen. A fun, stylized movie with a slew of comic moments and a bunch more head shaking events."
5345,"And the Esperanto - style combination of phrases everyone uses, from Spanish, French, Chinese etc could easily be envisaged in years to come. An example of this is the stolen diamonds in North By Northwest. Cold, impersonal environments like these simultaneously forbid and necessitate human warmth. So many films of this genre, and with massively higher budgets, often fail to achieve the lightness of touch shown here. They aren't there for you to watch, they simply set up the extraordinary confines of the romance."
5360,"The locations were beautiful, and the costuming was great, too. Solid if understated special effects and and some excellent dramatic moments with a few surprises along the way make Warriors of Heaven and Earth a beautiful experience to behold. It is great entertainment and gives one yet another view of the Chinese culture about warriors of its complex past. Warriors of Heaven and Earth is a decently made movie with some good plot developments. There are thrilling scenes of camel caravans and desert towns and forts."
5408,"The kids in this film are all interesting enough to listen to - they're talking about their "" fabulous "" lives after all. She, along with S. I. Newhouse IV and Josiah Hornblower, appear to be the most well - adjusted of the bunch. Bottom line, parenting / mentoring makes well rounded, responsible children into adults. It is very clear that well - rounded, responsible adults come from proper mentoring, not undeserved wealth or social status. It is one rich kid interviewing others."
5412,"The alt - rock soundtrack is superb and Caouette, a handsome, playfully schizophrenic star - in - the - making, is a talent to watch. There are just as many stretches of questionable sincerity on Caouette's part as there are exhilarating moments--a joyous romp on the beach with mom or a beautiful, revealing childhood lip - synching take on "" Frank Mills "". Caouette has created a masterpiece and is changing with this film the face of documentaries. What makes Caouette's documentary impressive is that you sometimes forget that he is the one creating the masterpiece. Supported by Gus Van Sant and David Lynch, this movie is like a new born for the youg actor, director J Caouette."
5424,"Conclusion: Once you put together all these subtle hints you have a very interesting and very tragic ending. If Dogville shows the new directions taken by Director Lars von Trier since Dogme, It's All About Love shows the very different creativity of Dogme co-founder Thomas Vinterberg. Definitely an interesting topic of conversation on many levels. The film's use of close - ups takes a little getting used to, but is very effective at communicating the characters' emotions. From start to finish this is a fairytale, an intangible voyage through events and interactions with one overshadowing theme: It's all about love."
5436,"The direction, performances, cinematography, locations, pace, message etc., everything works perfectly in this great movie. The soundtrack and colors work wonders; taking your breath away with each shot. Tibber's expressive eyes and the breathtaking countryside scenery carry the film until Joan Plowright explodes on the screen. The characters in the film are phenomenal. Beautiful Photography, many of the scenes would be great standalone still photos."
5450,"Note the interesting time passage montages and flashbacks. The chemistry between Guillaume Canet and Marion Cotillard is simply perfect. Whether you like it or not, it's difficult to be indifferent to this movie and this is one of the best compliments a director can receive. Note the inventive visuals that employ a multitude of cardboard cutouts and idyllic fantasy settings. It has much of the same Pierre et Giles aesthetic that made the other film so memorable and the child actors also display a similarly remarkable complexity that is so rare when they are usually depicted in film."
5698,Garity and Lee deliver an all out performance. Played by Shawn Hatosy the performance is pretty stunning. Pace manifests Calpernia so well it defies his physical reality. Barry and Calpernia loved each other. It was a tribute and a reminder of how barbaric some humans can be.
5697,"The cast is as talented as it is visually striking - mixing weird beauty, youthful energy, and hard - edged agedness. Another thing is that everything feels authentic, from the towns to the corridors of the ships, everything is alive and is used in the scene, you actually feel that theses ships are real. None of the actors misstep, and each seems to know their character particularly well. The best scifi show since Farscape. Hand - held photography - pioneered in groundbreaking series like ER and Firefly - has started to become clichÃ©."
5699,"Otherwise, there are some bright young moments here. The production design and costumes are delightful. The stunning costumes, set, and dialogue--all very era - appropriate--were compelling. The cast that's compiled here are a definitive ensemble of well - known performers juxtaposed with a cast of then newcomers. With incredible settings, accurate costuming and luscious scenery, this movie captivates a prelude time period before WWII."
5700,"Gallo's instincts as a director are spot - on. Gallo plays Bud with brilliantly articulated physical suggestions. A lot of people will approach it with precise expectations, and most of them will be bored or even repelled by its disregard for convention. This is a truly radical film made by a very courageous filmmaker, someone willing to tell a story, tell it honestly and suffer the consequences of his convictions. In a time of overblown budgets and enormous productions with endless crew lists, Vincent Gallo has almost single - handedly made a concise, well - thought out, conceptual film--a poignant, touching love story."
5701,"The film is very well directed, and all the cast has good performances. Hanks is also good, as is Shawn Hatosy. The dialog is sharp and real, and Marcks has a real skill with his young cast. Good performances from Patrick Swayze and Hilary Swank make this a good cinematic treat. There's enough material for three horror movies--or, with wittier dialogue and more sparkling production values, a substantial sequence in a Quentin Tarantino movie."
5704,"The girl Shiori becomes close to comes in to watch her play. Finally there is a completely new scene at the end where the students ask Riki questions about the mission. The film also brings a new edge to the rules of the original, the irony of the children now being forced to work together instead of forced to fight eachother leads to some great scenes. Here is a full list and description of the major differences and new scenes! While a lot of it might be there just for provocation, there are moments where the semi-philosophical parts actually hit home quite well."
5706,"He wrote of his experiences in flop houses, bars, and women in a very distinctive, one - of - a-kind, formless fashion. As a dilettante's summary: a must for anyone ever read Bukowski and for others hopefully a trigger to start right away. He also had a string of women, some wives, the last one, Linda Lee, a beautiful, classy lady with a tough and tender edge worthy of Lauren Bacall. And it's interesting seeing some of Bukowski's lovers and associates again. Next he had ulcerative acne vulgaris as an adolescent and his face was covered with pullulating boils that left his face craggy and pitted for life--though there are angles in some of the varied films from different decades that show him tanned and sunny, almost elegant - looking and possessed of an evident macho sexiness that explains in part the many women in his life."
5716,"Some of the symbolism behind the scenes are stunning. Everything about this film is done in style and panache and creates a memorable experience, and has many memorable scenes. Same goes for Oldboy, you gotta admit some of the genius art - form it contains. Simply put, from a technical point of view, it's one of the best movies ever. Films have a right to stretch out reality, don't forget the reason it does this is to be entertaining."
5708,"There are laudable performances from the two central characters, and a third from Christopher Doyle's shifting oblique camera - work and composition. Pen - Ek Ratanaruang's direction is truly impressive, and his attention to detail is particularly worth praising. As it turns out the Yakuza scenes work very well. Asano in particular cannot be helped being taken to the viewers' heart; it's obvious here why he has such a high status in Japan. Boonyasak is not so sympathetic, but she is perhaps not meant to be, and she serves her purpose well."
5709,"The best bits in this are the convincing recreations of the look of the Reichstag and other places associated with the rise of Hitler. Needless to say - unlike the generally excellent' Nazis - A Warning from History' - this film neglected to point out the fact that nearly all of the leaders of the Munich communist rising were Jewish, and that this may have coloured his views on the subject - and his axiomatic linking of the jews with Bolshevism - an absolutely crucial aspect to understanding much of the Nazi era. First of all, the performances set by Carlyle and companions are quite good. Under his younger years he was a charismatic person whom "" manipulated "" people through his charms. The scene in the trenches where Hitler is mocked by his fellow soldiers and decides to take it out on his dog is simply a disgrace and an insult to the intelligence of all viewers."
5719,Furthermore he implemented his flair of storytelling through symbolisms and graphic metaphors quite nicely. Mysterious and sinister atmosphere is well made by the photographer Yamamamoto. Miike success in creating an intense and creepy mood that follows you all the way till the end credits. The film displays hair - rising and horrifying images with a bit of blood and graphical gore. So it is remarkable and truly rewarding to see how Miike toned down his tastes for the twisted and perverted in One Missed Call.
5722,"Guy Maddin just gets better and better. Maddin is truly one of the most imaginative of directors and he has a firm grasp of the medium. But most of all, there were those intoxicating legs. Guy Maddin is a master in at least one respect: he knows how to use 8 mm film. Maddin delivers a picture that is quite beautiful visually; all in black and white, and edited in such a way as to recall something resurrected from the 1930s."
5725,"Many amusing scenes are merely random bystanders doing silly things. As an achievement the result is miles ahead of the director's previous, briskly produced juvenelia and ought to be required viewing. In terms of animation quality Interstella is very good, the characters move realistically the locations look great and range from fantastical and blatantly mundane. However, the first four segments were Daft Punk's commercially released music videos for the Discovery the quality is exceptional, but after that the film seems to jump into a lower standard with thicker outlines and repeating of footage from the first four segments, that's not to say it doesn't look good. Basically if you like Daft Punk, Anime or Simply want to try something a bit different Interstella is worth checking out."
5726,"The fights are simply put amazing! Most of the one - on - one fights are well choreographed and quite intense. At their best they can be like a wonderful ballet with astonishing moves and moods. No wires, just a show of talent and that is what Tony Jaa brings. In Bruce Lee films it was just pure badassness."
5727,"After phenomenal success of "" Wu Jian Dao (2002) "" (or IA for short), a lot of hypes generated around when next two movies in the series are announced. Anthony Wong still delivers a high standard of acting just like in IA and how he plays the 3 ups - and - downs of Inspector Wong is simply terrific. Thought the first one was one of the finest Cop thrillers in recent years and the follow up is equally brilliant - for obvious reasons its a prequel set in 3 time periods leading up to the events in the first movie. The only disappointment is the absence of Tony Leung from the original cast; but it's rare that two movies in a series are as complementary, and as good, as these two. The actors portriating the young Wing - yan Chan (by Shawn Yu) and Kin - ming Lau (by Edison Chan) would be the weakest link in IA2."
5729,"In fact, there's a quote by some musician in the film about: "" Woodstock was a treat for the audience; the Festival Express was a treat for the performers . "" Anybody who has a warm spot in their heart for the music, the bands and the ethos of that era MUST add this DVD to their collection. In the wake of Woodstock, it was time for the players to have their fun. Her set alone is worth the price of the DVD. "" Festival Express' "" split screen camera techniques, the documentary style narrative and band lineups are bound to invite comparisons to the movie "" Woodstock . """
5732,"Their emotions are very real which really adds to the tension. Chris Kentis wrote and directed this with a keen eye and a good sense of tension mounting. This atmosphere helps create an extremely realistic feel, aided by the outstanding performances of Ryan and Travis as well as Kentis' naturalistic direction. He also brought out excellent performances from two newcomers, Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis. Shot entirely on digital video, Kentis achieves a look that is crisply, almost otherworldly beautiful and colorful and which at the same time conveys a stark, voyeuristic glimpse at a "" home movie ""."
5735,"The expressiveness of the two boys' faces is beyond wonderful. For as with any great film, "" The Return "" finds its way into the depths of one's soul and leaves the viewer a richer person for the experience. Among other things, "" The Return "" represents one of the most impressive directorial debuts since Francois Truffaut's "" The 400 Blows . "" Life's hardest truths sit like a stone in the mouth and won't be broken down easily. Astonishingly enough, this is the feature film debut for director Andrei Zvyagintsev who demonstrates more of a mastery and command of the medium in this his maiden effort than most directors do in a whole body of work."
5739,"Quite a feat considering how complex these entities actually are. Good documentaries have both a viewpoint and an agenda. ( p. 56) He adds that the corporation's sole reason for being is to enhance the profits and power of the corporation. Bakan, Achbar and Abbott play fair, and give both sides of the case--although that is not to say that the weight of evidence or sentiment is equally distributed. According to the film, most of the world's governments and job markets are run or at least affected by corporate power."
5740,"The comparison of the historical form of slavery to the present state of some workers in the poorest countries is appropriate. This movies is enjoyable as a satirical comedy with a message. It is very inspiring to see someone speaking publicly about the corruption of the WTO and the large corporations it represents. The Yes Men is a brilliant and hilarious documentary by the filmmakers of American Movie. In other words, the Yes Men are a group of socially conscious activists who engage in pranks."
5748,"Great camera work, the film really trusts the power of pictures. And of course the genuine kindness of strangers. There's something of An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge in it, but it's not quite that facile. The pace is slow and there are lots of gaps but that only adds to the charm of this delightful little film. The camera lingers on many long shots of subtle hilarity, emphasizing the humor in the sometimes mundane existence people experience."
5758,"even so, Gozu was really a peak experience. This makes it a great match with Miike's previous "" Visitor Q, "" another masterpiece of great symbolic kick and potent, unforgettable imagery. Acting: A - Hideki Sone, who plays Minami, is absolutely fantastic in this movie, as is Sho Aikawa, who has a supporting role in Ozaki. Script: B A little janky at some parts, but it compliments Miike's insane outlook quite nicely. By now someone watching this will have said more than once "" alright, this is starting to get weird "", but there's more in store on the side of the personal side, and something that happens that, as Miike can only do, actually softens the much more disturbing implications of the shock before the BIGGER shocker."
5781,"_ Stander _ was completely fascinating, from start to finish. Hopefully it will have some interesting extras Tom Jane was great in the role as Andre Stander, and was excellent in his confidence within the character. A great movie with great actors. This film has plenty of great action scenes and alot of great comedy as well as brilliant acting by the whole cast, especially Thomas Jane who shines as Stander."
5796,", and the music (haunting) are welcome bonuses. Beginning in the fall of 1986 and continuing for the next four years South Korea was haunted by the nation's first recorded serial killer. Kang - ho Song and Sang - kyung Kim are brilliant as the two cops who have drastically different views on how to solve a crime. The film begins with the first body discovered, a woman strangled with her own stockings, raped, tightly bound, and hidden in a drainage culvert. Serving as a foil to Park and Jo is Seo Tae - Yun (Kim Sang - Kyung) a detective from Seoul who has volunteered to assist with the investigation."
5820,"Check it out, chances are you'll be pleasantly surprised. Lots and lots of familiar faces too, plenty of great cameos. Great performances, and the alternative ending on the DVD is even funnier than the one in the film. Funny bits involve running clips from Kurt Loder, E! TV as well as a subplot about an obsessed fan, it's all woven together pretty well. If your heart is in comedy and you remember the great movies of BioDome, Encino Man, Son In Law, then you'll love this flick."
5826,"Zelary tells a powerful story and the film has been wonderfully made - the photography in particular is outstanding, capturing the beauty and harshness of the mountain village location. As the war refuses to go away, both Hana and Joza have to deal with fear and sudden death, and they both become increasingly resourceful and self - reliant. Although may not seem so at first sight these two movies have a lot in common. Zelary definitely pertain to the latter group. Set in Eastern Europe during the Nazi occupation, this is the story of a young, urbane, freedom fighter woman who faces discovery and capture every day in the big city."
5863,"And, of course, the thing that makes Harvie remarkable is that he survives. But now , 7 years later, this still retains a lot of its appeal. It's not been so long, but this still works on all its purposes, humor and visuals. And you feel engaged in the film thanks to the great narration done by Geoffrey Rush, he has one of those powerful voices. Harvie Krumpet is one excellent story."
5864,"and tremendous scenes of San Francisco. Word of mouth has generated large audiences in Seattle and the movie has moved to different and larger venue. Mr. Bittner is an very intelligent man, deeply empathetic and self - aware. The themes that even some of the best mainstream movies explore very well are that much more poignant and interesting when they're presented in real life. Bittner is an intelligent, thoughtful man, and sometimes engages in persuasive self - examination."
5869,""" Seriously, this film makes Eurotrip seem academy award worthy. It DOES have a lot of bad errors (the big snake scene, some of the fantasy's, and the ending). Will Friedle is a far cry from his Boy Meets World (horribly annoying) character and he's actually funny and his comedy is well timed and his expressions are classic. After their first couple of ideas turn out very badly, they find themselves in the company of two older ladies who appear to be very wealthy. Teamed up with Chris Owen, The Shermenator from the American Pie Series, you have a comedy team genius."
5895,"She was so brave doing that--and no ridiculous implants for her! it sucks you into these peoples lives. He silently amuses in the role, with the quiet nature of someone who is truly at peace with all things around him. He has several excellent scenes where he blurts out all these intense feelings. Cudos to Camble Scott for such great direction and Joan Ackermann for writing such a beautiful play."
5901,"A very touching movie and one that everyone will enjoy. The movie is exceptionally well made, especially considering its low 10 million CDN budget. If you love movies that are true to the culture they are portraying, this definitely is for you. Despite language barriers, the two characters manage to communicate well enough, and their relationship blossoms in a fascinating way. Annabella Piugattuk is wonderful as the succinct Inuit girl."
5338,"Scene: Sam and Largeman are in a bar. it is a simple, quiet film thats been made with a care only found in independent films. Natatlie Portman did an amazing job playing Sam. This is a film without violence about people living ordinary extra-ordinary lives and it's much more interesting than extra-ordinary murders, which very, very few, even in the USA, encounter. It is this moment that defines, with one pure act, the epitome of what it feels to be in your late teens, early 20's looking out at life."
4970,"Godsend has some admirable script characteristics, a good to great cast and some very good technical aspects. That makes some of their "" horrified "" reactions seem shallow or false. In short, this could have been a great movie about the moral problems posed by human cloning. Although Godsend also mixes some strong fantasy elements into its "" twist "" and the consequences that lead to the film being a thriller / horror picture, the basic idea is one rooted in actual genetics."
4969,"He is always quite a character in his movies. This movie is destined to lose a lot of money at the box office and become a DVD cult classic. The extravagant lifestyle that Black gains and the fact that he still tries to be best friends with Stiller causes Stiller to become crazy with envy. Just enjoy the insanity of the brilliant cast and be thankful that Envy has the common decency to forgo the usual pretense of profundity and focus on poop jokes instead. Not for everyone but if you like Stiler, Black or Walken, see the movie and judge for yourself."
5343,"For the better part of his career, Tom Cruise has played the All - American good guy. Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx are the stars of the film, Foxx winning an Academy Award. Foxx was entertaining, too, as the nerd - ish cab driver who is pulled into Cruise's murdering adventures. Through an interesting course of events, Max (Jamie Foxx), a timid cab driver who lives on dreams never full realized, gets pulled into the whirlwind of murders as the driver for a hired assassin. The smart dialogue, written by Stuart Beattie (Pirates of the Caribbean), is short, often witty and has a knife fight nature of quick cuts and ripostes."
5344,"Joseph Tobolowsky, Kevin Sussman are among the supporting players that contribute to make this film fun to watch. Nick Hurran shows lots of talent and he indicates he is up to the challenge in future projects. Having a job with your idol and making something of yourself would mean more than getting a guy in the end. Hunter plays the part of the little red devil on Murphy's shoulder so well that it would be hard not to see it until the final moments. But if you enjoy "" To Die For, "" "" American Psycho, "" and other dark satirical comedies, and you're up for a little snarky humor and some great media parody, you will probably enjoy this movie."
4858,"One of the stand - out performances came from Hank Azaria. After their reception they head to St. Bartes, for their honeymoon. Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston are both intelligent and (especially Aniston) fairly versatile actors. And Jennifer Anniston really isn't that pretty, but her HAIR looks great. Debra Messing made a small role as Lisa but she wasn't anything great, Philip Seymour Hoffman was hilarious as Sandy Lyle."
5346,"In fact, it has many more redeeming qualities than AH. Bottom line - this is a good movie that actually delivers the laughs. Written by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, the story is more hit than miss, with inspired moments and a drugged out cool. "" Harold and Kumar "" has some of the funniest scenes that sometimes blur lines of taste. The Acting is Right on from the 2 leads and there are quite a bit of funny cameos."
5347,"Memorable scenes include the ball, the parade, the wooden leg, and the continuing romance between Joe and Queen Clarice. Completely ignore the only two interesting characters and their complex love story to focus on the teen dream of the "" perfect man, "" and the fight to win him from the dark side. Take one virginally attractive young woman, give her no brains but an abundance of good intentions, place her in a variety of bumbling situations and add one completely plastic love interest. For every little girl who ever dreamed of becoming a princess, this film is the perfect way to spend two hours. Enjoyable to other adult women and men who just want a happy trip to fantasy land with no worries about sex, blood, or blue language?"
5348,"Cinematography is crisp and pleasing to the eyes. Moves at a good pace, especially after the first half hour. Yes, his set design here is fantastic (it's no surprise that a great amount of pre-production work went into creating these enormous surroundings). And the film's director, Paul W. S. Anderson, has always excelled at set design. However, Anderson did show a lot of enthusiasm and both the pictures and previews for the film looked promising."
5349,"The movie was perfect, for what it is meant to be--90 minutes of excitement for adolescent boys. "" If you've watched Duelist Kingdom, you'll find it funny. , the anime (tv show), or the dubbed anime (any of the Yu - Gi - Oh! But the thing is, Pokemon the First Movie was better than this. Anyone who knows the series is bound to like the movie, so take a kid with you who likes Yuugioh."
5350,"All four performances were moving and believable. Mark Ruffalo and Naomi Watts always very gifted. The end here is as reassuring as viewers want (or need) it to be. Director John Curran keeps things tight and gets emotionally powerful performances from them. But the film is solidly grounded in reality, as embodied by the environment in which the two couples live--their home lives, their children, the very houses they inhabit."
5351,"The huge surprise is that the gags are relatively' tasteful', for want of a better word. "" Corner of Bumfuck and You Got a Purty Mouth "", Matthew Lillard snarls in way of answer. And it's loads of fun. One of the funniest scenes in a long time. This is one of the funniest movies of the year."
5358,"Bring the crackers because mama, this movie is bringin' the cheese! The objective is to find a flower, Blood Orchid, that flourishes for a couple of weeks every seven years and could be a fountain of youth, prolonging the expectation of life of human beings. From the lush jungle scenery to the splendid visuals of the snakes right under the surface of the water, Anacondas is at least a movie that's always nice to look at. He directed the underrated Halloween 4 and his older films are far superior to Anacondas. For cost - effective purposes, virtually all the effects are CGI, and they're only a tiny bit better than what one would expect from a Sci - Fi Pictures Original."
5359,"This is a solid 7 stars. Aaron Eckhart and Ben Kisnley are very good. On the one hand, the performances are all good, especially Ben Kingsley's. Director Merhige does an excellent job with atmosphere (who knew it rained so much in the desert of New Mexico? ) E. Elias Merhige's direction is good, but nothing memorable (although Kingsley's remote viewing sessions are pretty intriguing)."
8586,""" become dialogue classics in her hands. This time it's dished right back to the fear - mongers. Stylistically the film captures the spirit of the era, from the titles, to music, and the creative use of computer imagery and set design. It was a fun, witty, and fresh look at 50s Hollywood. It's a smart and sassy homage to fifties films that expertly balances farce with message."
5361,"Nair's version, with its visual and audible pleasures, has the potential to become one of the few successful attempts. Elegant costumes, beautiful scenery, and piano playing in excess all add to the sights and sounds of Mira Nair's film' Vanity Fair . ' Ifans' is a fantastic, heartbreaking performance, the best of the movie. If anything, this reincarnation of the Thackerey's novel is a joy for the eyes. The highlights are Declan Quinn's striking cinematography, performances by Hoskins and Atkins, the only two who seem to be having any fun, and a superbly restrained Ifans, playing convincingly against type."
5362,"The lead roles Cole Hauser and Tom Sizemore are quite impressive. The press will clearly do anything to get the perfect shot. Looked like a pretty interesting take on the action / thriller genres. Their teeth are perfect, their wives / husbands beautiful, their children beautiful, their homes are palaces and their lifestyles enviable. The story is good and entertaining but could go a little deeper, some twists here and there would have spiced it up a little."
5363,"There are a few twists and turns that will keep your attention. It was a top notch performance on everyones part. Simply with her eyes she portrays this wounded, internally saddened character effortlessly. A haunting theme weaves its way through this labyrinth of lies, leading to a satisfying (because inevitable) conclusion. the characters were eccentric and go to such great lengths for love."
5373,"1 hour and 30 minutes of Good Unforgettable Times. It is quite astounding how those Kids Act. Baby Geniuses II is really a Great Movie. Overall this film is for everyone, the jokes are hilarious, the action scenes are nail - biting and the polish of this family adventure is perfectly executed. Summary: The adventure continues with a new generation of talking babies."
5374,"All thumbs up for this one! David R. Ellis does a good job at directing. Cellular is a fast paced, exciting and entertaining movie. The parts that weren't so believable were very satisfying and the parts that were believable were incredibly suspenseful. In the end, Cellular is a "" B "" movie at heart and a pretty good one."
5375,"Thankfully, the lighting was very well done, so the film maintained a dark, night - time look while simultaneously allowing the viewers to perfectly see all that was happening. the cut scenes in the video game are better directed. Guillory has Helen of Troy (not from the film' Troy') on her resume, as Jovovich has Joan of Arc, Fehr has the mummy hunter, Ardeth Bay from the' Mummy' series and Epps is credible in several comedies. If you liked the first, are a big fan of one or more of the actors, or you just have nothing better to do for 90 minutes, give it a shot. Hollywood is known for its summertime action "" flicks "", and recent action films such as The Matrix began to show a hopeful turn towards a trend of thoughtful plots and interesting stories."
5376,"This is one of the great touches of the "" Mr. 3000 "". At the heart of the movie is the amazing Angela Bassett as Mo. . Mr. 3000 is a decent comedy that works a lot better then it should thanks to Bernie Mac and Angela Bassett. Stan parlays his "" Mr. 3000 "" title into a successful business. Without giving anything away, everything works out sometimes in the most unsuspecting ways."
5377,"The film is currently available in a DVD release that is visually handsome with superior sound, and the package contains a fair number of bonuses. The overall style is 1930's Art Deco mixed with bits of Neo-Futurism. The film starts immediately with a really great visual feel that harks back to the old sci - fi serials of the 1930/40's where the future is based on the present with knobs on. The shuttle references to classic sci - fi movies of the 1920's , 30's and 40's littered the screen. Paltrow has some comic moments but mainly she plays it pretty straight and is a little dull."
5378,"Bettany shines in this film and it shows the huge talent that he has. 1) Sporting an excellent Dolby Digital 5. Movie The movie has a lot of style right from the very cool opening credits. The filming of the tennis scenes are well done and keep the flow of the movie going. It's very funny too, and Paul Bettany shows a particular talent for timing, comedy and looks on camera."
5379,"The Extended Version fixes that very well. In the dÃ©nouement of The Forgotten, such a balance is rewarded, and leads to hope for the present and future while maintaining a reasoned embrace of the past. Equally interesting, though, are the more subtextual readings of the film. All in all: good acting, good story - 8/10. Di Pego and Rubin have poignant things to say about the nature of memory and its effects on beliefs and behavior."
5380,"the intro credits are simply brilliant! As far as comedies go, it was creatively warm and mostly. The performances by Baldwin, Broderick, Cusack, Flockhart - and, well, all of the inserted cameos - are excellent. The plot is well outlined on these pages. Calista Flockhart, Tim Blake Nelson, Buck Henry, James Rebhorn, do good work in the film."
5381,"This film is full of risks; some of which work. Waters has seen fit to have a lot of scenes play out to music, and this works well some of the time. He pokes fun at just about everything so it is a celebration of being freakish whether you're from Baltimore or anywhere else. And all the sex addicts are just awesome and show no shame. A DIRTY SHAME is the new film from John Waters, and arguably his funniest film yet."
5382,"Using different countries such as Peru, Venezuela, and Spain allows viewers to gain an insight into the vastness of life. The scenery is always beautiful with shots of the towns in a poor state and the general background of the countries is to be admired. The camera work, the musical scoring, the obvious commitment on the part of everyone involved in this glorious picture - every aspect of THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES is exactly right. They work out, and make themself beautiful by going to tanning salons. While the plot revolves around Che's awakening to the social struggles of South America (which are ongoing) there is a rich sense of place, and people, and beauty here."
5383,"Clever, witty, sweet and nasty and, at times, gory and horrific, SOTD has it all. The great British sit - com has undergone something of a revival in recent years. The funniest being a very subtle snipe at Boyles ` 28 days later' - see if you can spot it! The film, like Spaced relies on a flawless script, observational humour and the theatre of the absurd. The film begins firmly in very British comedy / drama territory, with a number of stylistic directorial flourishes that seem like a cross between Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream (2000) and Danny Boyle's Trainspotting (1996)."
5393,"It's no "" Shrek, "" but it's still enjoyable. While that statement had some merit, at the end it turned out that A Bug's Life was a far better movie entertainment-wise, despite cuter characters and simpler story and all that kiddie - like appearance. Zellwegger gives a decent, if shallow, performance as the love interest, and Jolie's Lola is barely on screen long enough for her to make an impact. Pixar seems to like choosing a simple story, one that a kid can understand, and than building upon it creating a wonderful movie for all ages. A couple of the jokes worked, some pop - culture references were funny, the movie was not too boring."
5394,"This is a film that definitely looks at the day to day lives of firemen as it is primarily through the eyes of Jack Morrison. In many ways an homage to those brave individuals in New York who sacrificed all during the terrorist attacks of 9 - 11 and also a deceptively smart character study. For all the focus played to the rising star Pheonix, it is the supporting cast that really stands out within the confines of the 105 minute running time. This film, through his character, humanizes emergency responders, their lives, their camaraderie, their courage. If you like firefighter movies, you will like this one, because some of the rescue scenes are spectacular."
5395,"At any rate, HUCKABEES is a clear descendant of films like MORGAN! e. e. cummings said it isn't easy to be nobody but yourself, but it's worth it. What's more, perceptions have an important role in this film. His wife is Dawn Campbell (Naomi Watts - Mulholland Drive), she is the gorgeous face, body and voice of the Huckabees corporation. Awesome soundtrack, inventive and original cinematography, some amazing performances and most importantly a great story."
5396,"Even if you don't particularly like Hillary, you should still see it because this is one of her best movies. Hilary Duff fans, if you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it please! the performances of Hilary as well as her supporting cast were honorable. A lot of people don't like Hillary movies but this one is worth seeing. After a little persuasion, she makes it there, and the movie is more or less about her exploits therein."
5397,"Perhaps thats why it feels so fresh. It's amazing what can be done with only $7 , 000 - in comparison to what others do with $200 , 000 , 000. A budget scifi with lots of intellectual intrigue. In fact the film contains and is defined by many aspects deliberately avoided in "" sci - fi movies "", namely, the surface banality inherent in much of engineering or innovation. Listening to these characters talk, you feel relieved that there is none of the nonsense typically associated with sci - fi films: no buxom models or chisel - faced bodybuilders arguing passionately about trivialities while secretly accomplished in physics."
5398,"But special kudos go to Clair Danes - this is her best performance to date. A conniver and master manipulator, here his skills are shown as being wholly adapted to surviving in a court attended by intrigue at every turn. As previously referred to, the acting is exceptional, especially the two leads (Danes and Crudup) who shine. This is unfair - the film is more thought provoking, substantial and better acted than the aforementioned Oscar snaffler. Ned Keynaston (Billy Crudop) is the leader of the pack, a star of the stage whose Desdemona is the height of his career."
5399,"At times infectious with fun and genuinely funny this is a great look at several aspects of enhancing one's life. He played the part with great skill and brought out just the right emotions from the audience who applauded at the end. And there a couple of genuinely funny moments (none better than the Gere - Tucci moment in the men's room). The sets were realistic and not overly noticeable, leaving the attention to the actors where it belonged. , everything that is, except fun in his life."
5400,"This could be by far the funniest film this year. Another infamous scene that got a lot of attention, was the sex scene between 2 lead puppets. This bears the standard of a great film by expressing the ironies innate in every argument in this quasi-political tale; from socialist Michael Moore, fashionably charitable celebrities to the terrorists and the, ahem "" world police . "" The movie is a lot of laughs, and makes fun of an endless row of Hollywood clichÃ©s and has tons of movie references. And the songs are hilarious too!"
5401,"One thing that's rare in movies is something real. A welcomed little performance piece film full of nice little moments. Zooey Deschanel delivers an amazing performance. Ray Romano and Hank Azaria deliver priceless performances. Regardless of what others say, the film is great."
5905,"As soon as you can place yourself in her shoes, you will find this film moving, and very clearly (and poetically) observed. A beautifully filmed story, the two film comparisons that come to mind are The Virgin Suicides and Morvern Callar. All of these films feature young girls, coping with circumstances that throw them into a spiral - an internal spiral - filmed with grace, attention to detail and a good ear for the soundtrack. "" Somersault "" is a vivid, interesting coming - of - age tale about a young girl who runs away from home, and quickly has encounters and experiences that force her to grow up fast. Was also nice to enjoy some good acting from unknown faces and excellent cinematography - the film had a great look - pale blue / white and red, and good editing."
5422,"This is one of the best performances by anybody in recent years. The entire cast was perfect, great screenplay and awesome settings. All - in - all, a good movie, a great Oscar - worthy performance, and a good way to spend 2Â 1/2 hrs. Hackford's stars are likely to be rewarded with trophies and --- better yet --- more starring roles. The music, also, is incredible - it really showcases the breadth of Charles' music, from country to blues, and everything in between."
5411,"Showing the boys' fates at the end was an excellent conclusion. It had incredible performances under a great director with a fantastic story to back it up. One thing the movie does extremely well is taking hackneyed plots of the individual players (because it's all been done before) and putting them all in the background. Sports fans often regard their teams as extensions of themselves. Billy Bob Thornton was excellent as the coach, facing pressure on all sides to win the state championship."
6112,"Similar to the Bergmaneque feeling of that film, Hirokawa achieves a consistent aesthetic that matches an art design that sees characters occupying clean white and gray spaces rendered with a soft graininess. Ichikawa solidifies these intense layers of feeling with wonderfully basic techniques: stirring skylines and skyscapes used as backdrops; lovely, tangible environments; and discrete, minimalist camera angles--key conversations shot from behind the characters, over the shoulder, for instance. This section of plot takes up a much greater portion of Haruki Murakami's original short story, and Jun Ichikawa made a wise decision in reducing it, though utmost respect for the source material is in evidence throughout the film. Director Jun Ichikawa demonstrates a uniquely idiosyncratic film - making style somewhat reminiscent of Yasujiro Ozu's work in his constant use of lengthy medium shots shot at waist level, as well as a certain narrative sensibility that focuses on elliptical episodes to unfold a story in a subtly uneventful manner. From start to finish, really, the film is an episodic accumulation of small, deeply - touching scenes tied together by very simple yet evocative piano music and the enchanting voice of a narrator (Hidetoshi Nishijima) whose warm, thoughtful delivery makes one think of some poet of a bygone era."
5413,"Gandolfini is also excellent, as always. If you want to have an enjoyable couple of hours, definitely check this one out. The cast was wonderfully chosen and Ben Affleck plays a good leading role. Nevertheless, there are many positive attributes to this genre subverting film. The pleasure is in the reaction of Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) and the comments of Brian Valco (Josh Zuckerman)."
5414,"That's right, this baby is stocked with jump scenes! From the very start, hitting you again and again with relentless, unforgiving, terrorising scenes! definitely going to get this on DVD when it comes out. The Grudge has a couple significant differences from other recent examples of that trend, however. They are spirits whose purpose is to cause the pain they have suffered."
5415,"Law's current squeeze Miller all make strong impressions. , and can judge the movie without preconceptions, it's actually quite, quite good. It takes a story very much associated with a particular time and place--London in the swinging '60s--and successfully transplants it to modern - day New York City. and delivering her final coup de grace with devilish elan], Long, Krakowski and especially (surprisingly? ) Alfie goes through the motions as he does in the original, but there is considerable chunk of life missing."
5416,"The standout performance in the film was Paul Giamatti's. And he does it in the funniest most entertaining way. Beautiful, saturated colors and light that evokes films of the 70s, long takes, edgy humor mixed with touching introspection, SIDEWAYS is a visual treat that gets better with subsequent viewings. Thus these two opposites (who are more alike than they appear on first glance) have all sorts of adventures and misadventures. Overall, this film is for those who like movies based in reality, which as you will see can produce some of the most bizarre and comical situations of all."
5417,"The very atmospheric nature of the film is supported very strongly by excellent performances all around. As you watched it, you knew that there were answers at the end and the journey was simply captivating! No matter how many pounds he lost, it's a remarkable performance. It's adorable how the movie constantly establishes new plot points without ever getting tedious. In that way it is closer to films like Magnolia or the Others, where the apex is the characters."
5418,"Everything is flawless about this film. His ambitions as director are greater than ever. He sets up the story here very smartly; it's Altmanesque the way that the lives intertwine. And the acting is great and the scenes of the family interacting in close quarters, moving in synch are so pitch perfect you feel they have been doing this for decades. Come to think of it, most of Mike Leigh's movies have this effect."
5419,"These extra songs are not to be missed. So, what you get with this movie is a lot of performances that are reasonably strong, a couple of weak ones, and a handful that are just great (Solomon Burke, the Neville Brothers, and the just - too - cool - for - words Clarence "" Gatemouth "" Brown come to mind instantly). Tyler and Perry rip up their numbers and bring the place down. An amazing house band led by drummer extrodinare Steve Jordan, backing the absolute cream of the crop of blues legends. With all due respect to the blues legends that performed, and were celebrated in this documentary, it was awesome."
5420,"Both are big, physical, attractive men whose faces aren't unalike. The cinematography by Green regular Tim Orr is lovely though, with its rich locales and saturated color. On top of all that the film is beautifully shot, perfectly acted / cast and the music fits the moods in each scene. The grandparents who appear in the denouement are priceless, like so many of the incidental characters. This may seem anti-climactic, but it's extremely effective and it makes the chase sequences very exciting and 1970s - influenced."
5421,"This was an enormous achievement for Aussie newcomers â€“ James Wan, and Leigh Wannell. It delivered the necessary chills, to keep its audiences fully awake, and engaged. This movie has the perfect mix of scares and a really bizarre plot. With "" Saw "" James Wan and Leigh Whannell, the creative heads behind this project, set new standards. Well, the story is actually unlikely, but everything in the film is physically possible."
5423,"It is one of the best movies of the year. Craig T. Nelson is perfect as Mr. Incredible. But by appealing to a kind of level late teens and adults can relate to, it reaches a higher, far more intelligent plane. Samuel L. Jackson was hilarious and thankfully, he wasn't overused. Quality of direction, scriptwriting, performance, production design, editing, photography, scoring - on all counts' Incredibles' triumphs, with deceptively effortless ease."
5847,"Ejiofor and Sevigny are also very adequate in their roles. The dialogues presented are human and dynamic. It features plenty of allenisms and classic Woody situations. The result ins quite different; this movie is not as critic as that, but is really enjoyable. The script is great; with parallelism and second interpretations - And the movie is really entertaining."
4968,"The performance of Denzel Wahington was brilliant, this guy continues being an excellent actor and that it continues this way. Actually "" fabulous "" is a small word to use for such talented actors. Denzel Washington plays one of his most engaging and emotional roles to date, and the rest of the cast perform beautifully. MAN ON FIRE is one of the year's best movies. Scott is at the top of his game here, revolutionizing subtitles along the way and adding an unmistakable grain to his movie that only helps it become more memorable as a gritty revenge flick."
5426,"The story is very simple but yet entertains all the way with some very adventurous scenes. All in all, quite an imaginative and innovative achievement--impressive enough to assure its place among future Christmas favorites with unlimited appeal for the young in heart. Even Ebert's written review gave it a full four stars! Tom Hanks and the others enter into the spirit of the whole thing with gusto--and all the performances are right on target. This film was a glorious explosion of the hope and Wonder that fills the memories of the Christmas of Olde."
5427,"The flashback scenes are presented in lush color with mostly subtle and gorgeous cinematography. There is a nice, near cameo appearance by Lynn Redgrave (Gods and Monsters) as the last interview of Kinsey, and she resonates in her brief appearance. As his research assistants, Timothy Hutton, Chris O'Donnell, and Peter Sarsgaard round out a very strong ensemble cast. Peter Sarsgaard is the stand out in the trio, as outstanding as his role in "" Shattered Glass "" and as all holds barred as in "" The Center of the World . "" The make - up, which has to age the principals 30 years or so, is masterfully done--at beginning of the film, you'll find yourself saying, "" Geez, Liam Neeson, John Lithgow et al look young for their age "", and at the end, "" Geez, they look old for their age ""."
5428,"If you're looking for an hour and a half of casual entertainment with solid performances, script and directing go see it. The film has some nice scenery and entertaining scenes, particularly the shark capture. It's not up to the standard of Oceans's eleven yet it beats the likes of Ocean's 12. She knows it's good and isn't shy about showing it, and (5) overall a good mixture of crime, comedy, romance and suspense and just right amount of time at just under 100 minutes. Take Pierce Brosnan - a great showman and a guy with asense of humor, add sexy as she's ever been Salma Hayek, add Woody Harrelson in good form, top it off with decent screenplay that does not take itself too seriously or risk falling into pretentious or shallow territory and you have yourself a very entertaining little piece of movie - making."
5429,"Oh look, matching Christmas jumpers â€“ how cute. Just one of his story lines in Love Actually is as good as or better than anything in Edge of Reason. First, the positives â€“ Colin and Hugh are still hitting their marks. Most of the funny in this movie comes from certain' episodes' as opposed to the dialogue. seeing things through her eyes, groaning as she put her foot in her mouth again and cheering for her to finally get it right."
5430,"Yours, is a performance of perfect beauty. Luke Spill, Joe Prospero, Nick Roud and especially Freddie Highmore were excellent. This is a brilliant cinematic accomplishment - a feast for the eyes, the ears, the brain, and the soul. He nailed J. M. Barrie and was absolutely captivating throughout the entire film. The magical moments in this movie seem to literally jump off the screen."
5431,"But as it stands with its PG rating, everyone can enjoy it. This is a film that will play well with young minds and with adults that will allow for the silliness of the situation at hand. This is a fun movie that most everyone in the family can enjoy. This treasure has been passed down through the centuries from great civilization to great civilization by conquest and all sorts of other means, but. Well paced with some good action scenes that will keep you hooked all the way through."
5432,"It's literally a laugh - a-minute film. There's a certain amount of slapstick and visual gags, but the dialogue and situations are fine too. But he's right, SpongeBob is a funny movie in it's own quirky, original way. It's non-stop laughs and plenty of color and all - out craziness. If you've never heard of SpongeBob, then there's quite a bit here that may humor you."
5433,In a lot of scenes it made sense. The performances in this movie are all right on the money. Farrel really looks a lot like Ryan O'Neil in Barry Lyndon. Stone is hypothesizing that Hephaistion was essential for what Alexander did. Hephaistion was as skilled a warrior as Alexander and a successful commander in his own right.
5434,"There are so many excellent documentaries being made these days. The ending, which juxtaposes images of media - darling Patty with the rest of the SLA either in jail or long - since dead, is truly stunning. Altogether, it is a gripping and often darkly funny insight into one of the strangest cases in pop culture as well as the annuls of crime. The film comes ready - made with the gripping narrative of a thriller - and proves the clichÃ© correct that truth is much stranger than fiction. After almost two years of living with the' enemy ,' the precious Patty Hearst was released."
5435,"CLOSER is a well crafted dissertation on art's reflection of the human condition, particularly the dependence on romantic relationships. He and Portman have amazing scenes together, and he's always on par. The face of Jude Law is, still, so full of possibilities. Jude Law is a Peter O'Toole without the steroids, Julia Roberts a Jeanne Moreau with an American passport, Clive Owen is a child of John Garfield and Peter Finch and Natalie Portman a Jean Peters with a college degree. The four leads, are remarkably and perhaps unrealistically witty."
6710,The story presented is not one where all the pieces fall into place like a script. That is a long way to get around to an opinion but here goes: The interviews are great. This documentary presents fascinating stories about movies and filmmakers. as well as some scattershot clips from various movies that were carried on the station. The documentary drops hints that the fall of Z Channel parallels the demise of Mr. Harvey.
5437,"Yimou sets a number of scenes within symmetrically perfect backgrounds, the picture set up like a work of art. Zhang Yimou, once a photographer and cinematographer himself, has an exquisite eye. The scene has a steady tempo, finally hitting a crescendo as the whole bowl is flung, nuts flying everywhere like missiles striking every drum. The cast, the scenery, the music, including vocal performances by the legendary Kathleen Battle; all elements conspire brilliantly to convey subtle and nuanced meaning in moments. Shi Mian Mai Fu belongs to a growing body of work that embodies a clearly Asian aesthetic packaged just as clearly for Western consumption."
5438,"By far the strong suit of the film was the cast and their generally above par performances. The storyline was entertaining and full of just as many twists and turns as had graced the first one. and pretty much everything else in comparison to the original Ocean's 11. After the success of the remake of Ocean's Eleven, out comes the sequel three years later. Garcia appears for the first few minutes, and returns for an exceptionally brief scene at the end."
5439,"comic fans around the world should now panic as to what he sets his sights on next. Pros: Ryan Reynolds put on some serious weight. Those good old days of Blade kicking ass are gone, replaced by Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds beating down brittle MTV vampires that couldn't hold a candle to Stephen Dorff's Deacon Frost. Cons: Dracula wore gold chains here. The first two were exciting, with punchy dialogue, impressive villains and most importantly, a hero, the man himself, Blade."
5441,"Bush won the election, and with the help of Rove, won the presidential nomination and the general election. If Rove is behind some of these dirty tricks, which seems entirely plausible, then you have to admire the guy. However, "" Bush's Brain "" shows that Georege W. Bush does indeed have a brain working for him; it just happens to be within the head of another individual. But when Rove is involved the tricks turn positively filthy and sometimes illegal. The film briefly deals with his rise to prominence, and then spends most of its time focusing on three separate campaigns that Rove worked on."
6758,"There are a couple of good lines and the performances are solid â€“ Rory Conroy being the best. However it does have some funny moments and moves along at a brisk pace. It's also fantastic to see the raw talent of Ruaidhri Conroy back on screen and with none other than Brendan Gleeson, the master! McDonagh (formerly a playwright, here making his film debut) is a master craftsman, able to play several levels at the same time. This film is beautifully acted by Brendon Gleeson and especially RÃºaidhrÃ­ Conroy, sharply photographed, and well directed by McDonagh himself."
5452,"Powerful, thought - provoking, educational and debate worthy, there need to be more documentaries like this in times like these. Egyptian - born, Harvard - educated director Jehane Noujaim, having worked with D. A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus on""Only the Strong Survive""and""Startup. In a democracy, all voices have a right to be heard. If there were ever a quintessential journalistic document to point to 100 years down the road and say: "" THAT was what it was like in the world, sonny boy, "" this documentary would be it. ' Lt. Rushing is one of the more interesting characters, at first a central - casting officer spouting the Pentagon message."
4967,"But somehow thanks to Garner and Ruffalo, "" 13 Going on 30 "" has undeniable charm. Suddenly 30's not innovative and it's certainly corny, but this chick - flick take on Big is charming. Jennifer Garner, transported from a 13 year old girl into her 30 year old future self, gives a thoroughly appealing performance which is backed up with strong support from the likes of Mark Ruffallo, Judy Greer and Andy Serkis. If you're looking for a great way to invest 100 minutes of your life, see From 13 to 30. Jennifer Garner sparkles with charisma and sizzles with charm."
4966,"Using the tried and true style of fist fights and pyrotechnics this movie keeps the character rooted in his all too mortal persona. This is by far the best film in the reinvigorated sub-genre of comic - book - to - screen conversions. So far this is probably the best of the non - X - Men / Spider - Man Marvel movies. The acting in this movie was extremely well done, a lot more well done than many people (critics) have given it credit for. The sometimes - juvenile but interesting action scenes, the diverse characters in here and the humor all combine to make this better than anticipated."
5675,"Zhang Suping (William Chang Suk Ping) does a wonderful job in creating an enrapturing atmosphere set in the late '60s. This is not an easy film to follow and it is most assuredly one that will grow in importance with repeated viewings. But it is Kar Wai Wong, the writer, director, choreographer, colorist, visionary that makes this excursion into the interstices of the mind / imagination so overwhelmingly satisfying. The film's technical level (costumes, music, photography etc.) is also very high. The actors in every role include many of the finest actors available: Li Gong, Ziyi Zhang, Carina Lau, Maggie Cheung, Takuya Kimura, Chen Chang, and of course Tony Leung."
4965,"The final twenty minutes of the movie fully justify the term ` awesome. Mr. Tarantino, you will be hard placed to match this gem. ' was delivered with such believable sincerity and emotive sadness, it closed a chapter in Beatrix's and the viewer's recent experiences with remarkably good taste. Madsen's good, though, and so's Daryl Hannah as another rather mouthy assassin, Gordon Liu as Pei Mei, and especially Perla Haney - Jardine as a girl named B. B. Very emotional and touching movie with a few key gore scenes."
4964,"Duchoveny is honest, and the rest, well, the are believable. Toni Collette as Carla also gives a warm performance. Collette and Vardalos are sizzelin hot! It was funny, well edited, and gave the audience a few things to think about in the meantime. Yes, this Laverne & Shirly type of comedy is better than anything else released so far in 2004."
4953,"The first movie (Whole 9 Yards) was witty, humorous, and surprisingly good. Although not nearly as funny or as exciting as the original, The Whole Ten yards will surely entertain However, the film is never far away from a one - liner or comedic set piece to keep it moving and there are a number of big laughs. Matthew Perry's wisecracks are mostly amusing, and he is in his element the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. In The Whole Ten Yards, there is a scene that makes a reference to Hughes' Planes, Tranes & Automobiles (1987), but let's just say that it was more funnier when Steve Martin and John Candy did it."
5850,"And original music by Gary Meister complemented the moods of the film well. The music adds a great deal to the proceedings. Also the selection of the four bowlers to highlight was a great choice as they all were so different. It would also have been interesting to show some of the international PBA regulars that compete on tour (they did show a brief piece on England's Stuart Williams but should have included Ameletto Monacelli or Mika Kouvunemi). Williams and Weber are the two superstars of the tour, and get the majority of the movie for themselves, but it also follows former team USA member and rising star Chris Barnes on his journey to greatness, as well as a PBA hall - of - famer with 20 career tournament wins, Wayne Webb."
4952,""" Ella Enchanted "" is nice enough to sit through--Hathaway's presence keeps things going, and there are enough nice visuals. Well as for the other cast member - There was a casting perfection as taking into consideration Cary Elwes, Minnie Driver and Vivica Fox, all were matched perfectly to their designated roles. From the beginning Ella Enchanted was good â€“ and all thanks to the beautiful Anne Hathaway who seemingly sparkled. The supporting roles are cute, witty, and fill out the movie in all the right places. The interesting opening scenes were great as they transported you to the fairytale world."
4951,"Each has his obstacles to overcome, and each shows significant growth as their fates are played out. The principals, the tempestuous Houston, the celebrated Crockett, the fearsome Bowie, and the young, unproven Travis are portrayed as real humans rather than as demigods. Some untold truths left off the film are worthy of mention : 1. The decision to acquire recognition of Texas as a nation required an acting head of state to preside, so the United States was chosen. Director John Lee Hancock does a marvelous job with subtleties that encompass great portions of Travis, Bowie and Crockett's personality in particular."
4950,"Yes there is indeed 11 minutes worth of credits. O_O But if you wannasee a good Dwayne Johnson movie, this is certainly better than the other movies he's done so far. For one thing he is an big strong guy, and when he is laying "" the smack down "" on the villains it is believable and thoroughly enjoyable. Sure, he does look a little awkward in some scenes but overall he's very competent. It's extremely fast paced, well - acted, the action scenes are excellent, and at just under 80 minutes, it's exceptionally lean too."
4948,"The twists don't feel like twists. But then, they're young and animation appeals in general. The likes of' Snow White' ,' Pinnochio ,' Bambi' and those like it are apparently gone for good! Maybe there are faster or cheaper ways of making these movies, but a great history is coming to an end. Roseanne provided a funny voice to one of the cows."
4947,"The boy recognizes Hellboy and the scenes that follow the encounter are close to brilliant. The snappy - attitude lines are allowable because of Hellboy's partially juvenile personality. John Hurt is great in this, as is Jeffrey Tambor. The character of Hellboy self works out just great! The two characters Abe Sapien and Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor is wonderful! )"
4944,"The story is better and more interesting and the monsters and CGI - effects in general are more convincing looking. The monsters are enjoyable and are good looking. Still best parts are played by Matthew Lillard and the perfectly cast Linda Cardellini. In the picture there are comedy, tongue - in - cheek, slapstick, humorous moments, mild diversion and is pretty amusing. There still are some' fake' moments but on the other hand there also are some truly spectacular looking sequences involving monsters."
4943,"But Hanks plays it so smartly and charming, you can't help but be enveloped into its complex layers. Tzi Ma's death is particularly hilarious. She's the one thing about the remake the Coens' get right. The Coens have made many marvellous films over the years. Spoilers Falling short of a Coen masterpiece (such a Fargo), The Ladykillers can be described as a Coen gem."
6762,"That and the fact that the director worked on "" FLCL . "" As the above reviews imply this flick is utter insanity, but brilliant insanity! No other motivations beyond that other than imply its "" fun "". One of the many characters is Chinco Doll, a mutant with a drill. An enjoyable ~ 60 minutes for your mind to take a rest."
6080,"and less than 90 minutes its well worth your money. Inside these walls its a veritable jungle, with the strongest (and ofter most corrupt) ruling. This is the first 20 minutes of the movie, and it was simply awesome. He has worked as the cinematographer on Danny the Dog (a. k. a. Unleashed) and the Transporter. David Belle is an interesting choice in that he is the founder of Le Parkour, a movement where people try to move from point A to point B as fast as possible, in the most fluid manner as possible, without stopping, and always moving forward, never backward."
6078,"Without these classics and the skill involved in making them, today's movies wouldn't be what they are. The examples are great, the explanations on the "" unseen "" or "" hidden art "" of editing are perfect, the pacing is just right, etc., etc. . For all you folks out there that dismiss older films, you may be surprised by your favorite directors such as Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg and James Cameron praising the magnificence of silent films and many classics. The numerous analogies and the like are excellent. The contributions to film making of directors, actors, designers, cinematographers and sound recordists is self evident, but the film editor's role has seldom been understood nor its importance fully recognised."
5919,""" Saint Ralph "" is one of the best things that have come out of Canada in recent years. The characters are well developed, the plot intriguing and inviting, and the dialogue simply priceless. It truly is an inspirational film, without being sappy or relying on overwrought clichÃ©s. It approaches the "" inspirational "" movie genre (think everything from Rocky to Chariot's of Fire) but manages to evoke a genuine and unique flavour in the form. Ralph is an interesting character, his even blend of pure and impure motives providing both the humor that make the film entertaining, and the realism that make it believable."
5702,"If you're a fan of Bring it On then watch this one, just check your expectations at the door. Whittier is both nervous and excited. well one hour and a half, small, the story: clichÃ©, some funny parts. Don't be mislead by the title, because other than cheerleading, this movie has little (actually, nothing) to do with "" Bring It On "". it says something like "" with a group of rising, up - and - coming new stars ""."
5703,"Benoit Magimel is great to watch. Jean Reno made a solid job in his part as the cop Niemans and cool role of the horror legend Christopher Lee. The final confrontation between the starring and the contenders in the Â¨ Maginot line Â¨ tunnels is spellbinding. RiviÃ¨res Pourpres 1 was better than 2 because in the first there were much more suspense elements. Olivier Dahan tries to build on the success of the first' Rivieres pourpres' and brings back Jean Reno in a second series which has little in common with the first film, unfortunately."
5713,"The first fifteen or twenty minutes, introduced by the Lowe character with a steady and pointed commentary, brilliantly introduces the story's characters while it's signaling the movie's main conflict. This is one of the best adaptations of a King work, and there are far, far worse. A bit different than the 1979 version, mainly due to modern computer generated enhancements and Peter Filardi's loosely adapted teleplay. The second part was filled with great performances by the cast and fantastic special effects and was far more enjoyable to watch with Rutger Hauer as vampire Kurt Barlow, while James Cromwell as Father Callahan gave the best performance. This movie changes many of King's original notions, but maintains the heart and soul of his book."
5705,"Visually it was a very strong film, a fantastic film to feast one's eyes upon. The real star of the show of course is Jim Carrey. With his crazy persona, Carrey was good choice for this role. Visually, the film is stunning, the sets look straight out of a Tim Burton film, the costumes are fantastic, the direction is splendid and does a fine job of progressing the story. The movie was well done with (as many are saying) excellent scenery, costumes, etc., yet nothing made this film completely amazing."
7246,"The enhanced sequences in the film have a much more integrated feel to them than they did in theaters in the 90s. It was a little long winded but it has several great moments that one could pause at and come back later to finish. This was a great combination of fresh commentary and new behind the scenes footage. Of the three films, Star Wars exhibits the most improvement in video quality. Buttressed by spellbinding special effects, script scenarios that seemed to improve in leaps and bounds with each new installment, and a near mythological following akin to "" Star Trekkies, "" "" Star Wars "" became that rarified cinematic sensation; a marketer's wet dream."
6032,"Life is really a miracle, or rather some miracles. They are bright personalities, they are full of dignity, they are honest and direct in their feelings, and they experience life to the full. For those who have already seen other Kusturica movies, this one will clearly be seen as a further step in the evolution of a great director. Kusturica's humor is sharp and true. In this movie you can find real feelings, real values."
5707,"And the way these scenes unfold are incredibly spellbinding. And in the event Mr. Jeunet sees this, thank you! Even the smaller roles are well rounded and memorable, a testament to good casting, strong writing, and Jeunet's direction. The whole film has a very dreamlike aura to it and the colors are great. It also has well defined characters and nice touches of detail and exposition."
5884,"These are brilliantly handled by the director and screenwriter, Dennis Gansel. Their heart - wrenching performance is illuminated by director Dennis Gansel's artistic genius. Napola is the better of the two films by far. The acting is outstanding throughout, especially by the young stars of the film. It has brought back very vivid memories especially the scene where the parents bring their boys to the school at the beginning of of the term."
5885,"Shocking in places but ultimately rewarding to anyone prepared to give palindromes a chance. She did a fine job, but the parts of the film that have the strongest emotional impact are the scenes where the actress playing Aviva actually resembles the character's age. Upon this journey Aviva is played by many different actresses, all of whom portray her with the same facial expressions and mannerisms. "" Palindromes "" is a fascinating visual thought experiment. Nothing seems taboo to Solondz and this makes for a refreshingly different movie experience if you can get your head around it."
5710,"Everything, and everything good, exists in this flick! Faith Akin has really made a good job. Also the cast is very good, especially Sibel Kekilli and Birol Unel. Lead actor Birol and Sibel Kekilli have done a good job. Nobody could play Sibel better than Sibel Kekilli."
5711,"It is without a doubt one of the most visually engaging animes ever created. This is a beautiful anime that will be enjoyed by both long time anime fans, and even first time viewers. Like in the first movie, Oshii lets the movie halt at times, immersing the viewer in the richly detailed world he created. Mamoru Oshii and his crew did a masterful job creating a worthy successor to their 1995 adaptation of Masamune Shirow's original manga. A new Japanese cyberpunk masterpiece that makes the original GiTS look primitive by comparison."
4942,"Other than that, his and everyone else's performances were outstanding. Liv Tyler performance was very good and she really showed she has some talent. He had proved himself an expert of human emotions. Liv Tyler is fantastic, showing a great chemistry with Ben Affleck. Ben Affleck's performance was actually not bad and its watch able."
5714,"As she visits more often, her confidence grows, her dresses more revealing. Yet these intimate strangers bring quite a bit more to the screen. INTIMATE STRANGERS is an elegant film. The film is an intimate comedy, action is made by good dialogs. As Anna returns to William to unload her problems, Bonnaire and Luchini slowly build a thoroughly absorbing intimacy."
4941,"Hawke does his best with the material, though there really isn't much he can do with it apart from going through the motions, which he does reasonably well. Other players, Olivier Martinez, Gena Rowlands, Tcheky Karyo and Jean Hughes - Angalade are also quite good. D. J. Caruso directs and he does a decent job. Whether this was a smart career choice for Ms. Jolie is debatable. Although watchable, "" Taking Lives "" feels like a weak - spined, half - hearted effort in an already played - out genre."
5717,"Where "" Unleashed "" was a bit of letdown compared to its predecessor, it made sense and it followed the storyline well and even managed to wrangle up a boatload of genuine scares. J. R. Bourne does well as the second - in - command, but his character is just two - dimensional, the a â€” hole dimension and the d â€” chebag dimension. Although there are some great scenes this film, its only good if you are a fan of the Ginger Snaps series really. The make - up of the werewolves is excellent. The first is classic; wonderful acting, very clever story, realistic - looking werewolves, the humor in it was great and the scenery and style was just terrific."
5718,"Daniel Burman and Daniel Hendler have reached the perfect timing to expose contemporary idiosyncrasy in the finest shape. The delicate portrayals of emotion and spirit are heart - rending and hilarious together. Camera movements were even very popular in the 70s. The director, Daniel Burman working on the screen play with Marcelo Birmajer, shows he is a talent to be reckoned with. The grandmother, Rosita Londner, is also appealing."
7639,"Its something you'll be watching and quoting for years to come. He is charming and clever with his audience and moves quickly from topic to topic, so that although the show only went for an hour and a half it seems infinitely diverse and rich. Even the simple joys of life unleash that monster that swells inside of Dylan. His material is observational stuff but it is the writing that makes it much better than the same observations made by a more standard comedian; his turn of phrase and his imaginative take of things makes even the most obvious remark just that little bit funnier. Moran has a problem with everything and he's going to tell you about it in a very funny manner."
4940,"Jim Carrey, very simply, is at his very best. It is a tribute to Carrey and Winslet that they were able to do the same. Carrey and Winslet both turn in superb performances, as do the supporting cast. Carrey and Winslet did a perfect job acting as Joel and Clementine respectively. The story for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is hauntingly brilliant and, in some cases, personally gratifying."
5721,"There are some striking visual images. These two kids did an amazing job, one of which has had no previous experience. There are moments of comedy, of suspense, and thought - provoking elements. The use of stop - motion and accelerated exposures is characteristic of a style Boyle enjoys, and it accents the scenes where it is employed well. The story is told from the children' s' point of view, bright with color, and those children give extraordinary performances."
8480,"One of the best parts of this movie was the intro to Dasha. The cast was very good, with Zenon pulling off another excellent performance. The new characters were believable, as were the old ones. It was a great movie, with catchy phrases that will replay over and over in your mind. The directors focused hard on keeping the childish, soft heart and fun feel to the movie while at the same time showing that Zenon isn't perfect and most certainly has grown up."
5723,"And since the first one was such a grand spectacle of monsters and fx. This film has few locations but makes the best of them. It has some decent looking bugs that looked just as good as a big budget picture. there are plenty of much more entertaining B - movies out there. In the past few months, a bunch of direct - to - video sequels to highly successful movies have been released."
4939,"Rhames' performance clearly commands the most attention. There a few unexpected surprises that even the most attentive viewer will take pleasure in. It, like the zombies, moves fast and brutally throughout and is very, very tense. 1) Not a B - Movie; 2) An absolutely cracking A-Movie. What is even more amazing about this movie is that it's [re] creators have also managed to tap into what will surely be the unanimous expectations of the target audience."
6020,"The interviews, voice overs, and lingering camera shots of a still photograph were all spot - on. That was a very interesting twist that stood out in a film filled with interesting and satirical twists. The movie, amazingly, is put together so well that you find yourself laughing at points and cringing at others. Instead of Better Homes and Gardens, there's Better Homes and Plantations. This new twist on "" what if history "" will touch many different emotions."
6463,"The characters are fairly well developed. The dynamic between these two characters is very well done. The writing, directing and performances were world - class. Few' coming out' films flesh out the territory as succinctly and realistically as this. The movie is slyly comical, with a lot of big laughs."
6039,"It's well - paced and there are sufficient surprises to keep you guessing throughout. The music is beautiful, all the score is chosen at the right moments and its pretty damn elegant. Perfect songs used with impeccable timing create a distinct, moody atmosphere. Dead Man's Shoes is an expertly delivered thriller, with subtle tension and great performances. The film also uses its Derbyshire locations brilliantly and looks fantastic."
5728,"This is not just a family torn apart or a budding, forbidden romance, it is also the core mother - daughter dynamic seen though the teenaged daughters and their respective mothers. All the kids are pitch - perfect, especially the young actress who plays the Clasky's daughter, Bernice. Ms. Leoni gives a good performance as this confused woman who, in wanting to please her maid, irritates her by exposing young Cristina into things out of her league. Rich people, sometimes, feel guilty about the domestic help they must have to keep their lives in order, which seems to be what's the problem at heart in this story. She delivers some subtle scenes of conflicting emotions."
5891,"Crash features a top - notch ensemble cast which includes: Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Jennifer Esposito, Brendan Fraser, Chris "" Ludacris "" Bridges, Loretta Devine, Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillipe and Larenz Tate. Set over a 24 - hour period in contemporary L. A., it is a social commentary on the interconnectedness of life in the big city. All put in superb performances in a tight script which is at once gritty, heartwarming, shocking, tragic and witty, and which will ring true with viewers of all demographics. The complexity of the film comes from the encounters between characters and their tangled lives and worlds. This is what gives the movie wings during its second hour, makes it interesting, keeps you guessing and on knife's - edge."
5730,"Barratier has had good success with his young actors. The picture itself is made "" Ã  la "" 50s, it's very special but truly desserves the highest awards. The story is fantastic, the music is magic, Jugnot is expectedly grandiose. In "" The Chorus, "" Christophe Barratier draws on this tradition and adds some lovely vocal sounds. If you like this movie recommend it to others as it deserves to find its audience."
4932,"The Pulitzer Prize winner of' Glengarry Glen Ross' shows he can keep suspense without sacrificing intelligence. The support are therefore a mixed bunch â€“ few have any real characters of substance but generally people like Macy, O'Neil and others all spouting tough dialogue is still worth seeing. He nails the character Scott, to a tee. Everything in the story really revolves around him. More surprising than the impressive stylistic touches was perhaps the moments of action, which Mamet delivers with real tension and pace â€“ not bad for a playwright!"
5892,"Words can only reveal so much, while Araki's images display an almost unbearable amount of visceral material, exploiting vibrant color, alluring texture, dark and light, the brooding and harrowing eyes of Joseph Gordon - Levitt, and the handsome modesty of Brady Corbet. From the superb performances, the excellent and intelligent script, through to the inspired direction and stunning' shoegazer' soundtrack this is a splendid film. The lead performances by Brady Corbet and Joseph Gordon Levitt are terrific. Such movies are not always good, but they are always interesting. Chase Ellison captures the emotions of his character very well."
5733,"There were many funny moments between "" Cary "" and Alim. The director, Ian Iqbal Rashid, was present and provided a wonderful Q&A following the showing. A remarkably charming homage to a dozen 40's , 50's and 60s romantic comedies. The issue of responsibility to parents and family versus following ones own feelings about how to live was also touched on. Kyle Maclahan has clearly enjoyed himself, and it is a delight to watch him perform."
5734,"Still the humour and action set pieces are enough to pull it through. The rest of the performances are pretty good. Layer Cake deserves a wide audience and there's more than enough of everything for everyone to enjoy. Although there are some problems with the story, Matthew Vaughn has made a respectable movie. As long as he works on the clarity of the plot more, he will have no problems securing full audiences."
7804,Interviews with pretty much everyone (well the main players) who had to do with the film.
5736,"This is surprising when the rest of the tension building moments are so much better formed. Almost 40 years after the original the 2005 version shows how much the world has changed. Once it hit the first sand dune, it would have broken up into small chunks after the first ground strike. Perhaps what's missing is the guiding hand of a master craftsman like Aldrich to really deliver the goods (John Moore, a far less distinguished director, is manning the controls here). "" Flight of the Phoenix "" is at best a so - so remake of the fine Robert Aldrich adventure classic from1965."
5737,"They give naturalistic performances and say real things. Her Millie is mature way beyond her years. Hers is one of the best supporting performances the year. The first point that calls the attention is the performances of this young generation of promising and talented actors and actress. The dialogue, their emotions, their reactions to a crisis, are very spot on."
4931,"Interesting performances (Bello is pretty good as the wive too) and some dry humor does not change that. Koepp payed some good attention to what David Fincher did with his' Panic Room' screenplay, especially with the camera. Just an enjoyable Friday / Saturday night matinÃ©e, and worthy of recommendation if you're not looking for anything special. It's obvious Stephen King knows exactly what's going on in Mort Rainey's mind, and Koepp, a successful and busy screenwriter, probably connected with the material for the same reason. Watch this film with an open mind, taking to heart each character's motivations."
5918,"In this day and age it would appear that films that are British made now need a certain Hollywood endorsement or require to be set in chic surroundings in order for it to be considered a triumph. The film looks gorgeous, shot in the beautiful Yorkshire moors, and the direction is sharp. Both girls in this movie are superb, wonderful actresses. First of all, the young leads Nathalie Press and Emily Blunt acted superbly; these newcomers are really stunning for the way they movingly played this character drama, showing every sort of emotion a human being may feel. This film is a near perfect rendition of an oft told tale of growing pains and confused adolescent feelings and is so delightfully rendered as to make any further comment superfluous."
7920,"Hats off to the directors for spotting this amazing talent. Yes, this is a tragic story and has some interesting twists. Possible spoilers ahead--best read once you know a thing or two about the case and the players. If the twists, turns, anger, love and incredible, mind - bending insider views weren't already enough, every single episode added had an incredible emotional charge to them. No matter how you * personally * welcome what the director presents you, the raw honesty and the human emotions will affect you - from everyone involved in this tragedy."
5741,"; just a kind of "" yeah, that's right, these people and these feelings are real "". But he gets ample support from Birthistle. There's something deeply honest about Yaqub and Brithistle's performances. It is Casim and Roisin who must determine what their destinies are, and this non-fatalistic scenario is often the case in real life. He consistently makes superb films, movies that comment on important social issues."
5742,"There are some truly breathtaking moments of foreshadowing, and a quite gorgeous continuing circular composition of the story. A beautiful film, touching profoundly up the simple, yet divine aspects of humanity. superbly directed, acted and sung, it brought tears to many eyes, and smiles to all. Hearfelt thanks to Kay Pollak and the wonderful cast for this superb treat! This film's structural similarity with the likes of The Full Monty, Brassed Off, Calendar Girls and On a Clear Day shows its indebtedness to the formula."
5768,"Small roles are well performed by David Paymer as one of Dan's subordinates and Selma Blair who briefly shows up in the beginning as Carter's new wife, Kimberly. The acting by the leads is top rate and the Grace and Johansson paring could end up being the Hanks / Ryan of the new millennium. Here's a film that in some ways resembles and is a bit of a genre successor to "" The Graduate, "" that 1960s iconoclastic gem. When a sports magazine gets bought out, Dave Foreman, an ad sales executive (Dennis Quaid) finds himself playing second - in - command to Carter Duryea (Topher Grace), a hotshot barely half his age. At 51, Dan is feeling his years as the younger and ambitious Carter seems to be his polar opposite as well as a reminder that his best years may be behind him."
5743,"As in almost all English movies the acting's great. A Fantastic Movie from start to finish, with brilliant acting, script, dialogue, poignancy and laughs. Danny Dyer proves that there is more to young British Actors that Jude "" Pretty Boy "" Law and Orlando "" acts with his eyes "" Bloom with a stirring performance as Tommy Johnston. Throw in the punches and a ream of genuine laughs and you got a film that is easy to like if you belong to a certain demographic. The social critique is as prominent in the film as the football hooliganism, and the bathos that runs throughout is definitely a strong point."
5744,"Possible Spoilers *** First of all, major praise goes to Jang Dong Gun's riveting performance. SHIRI was the South Korean film that probably did more than any other to bring the country's cinematic new wave into being, and especially into the field of view of the rest of the world at large. And then there are the battle scenes which are wonderful and frightening and seem to be the total chaos that war really is. In 1950's Seoul, Jin - Seok (Won Bin) and his older brother Jin - Tae (Jang Dong - gun) are enjoying a strong family life of perfect happiness. In most Hollywood productions there is only one perspective, the winners view."
5745,"The amazing genius and operative dexterity of surgical research phenomenon Vivian Thomas, and his focus on, love for, and persistence with his work against seemingly unscale - able obstacles, in superbly portrayed by Mos Def. What they achieved is one of the most significant advances in medicine ever! This is a compelling, touching film, with wonderful performances all around. You see it in his eyes, in his pauses, in his voice. Everything excellent about filmmaking can be found in this superb production."
5746,"It was so awesome to see these famous people depicted as normal human beings. Hetfield's re-emergence from re-hab is when the film really gets into gear. Joe Berlinger & Bruce Sinofsky are always there in time to catch the most important facial expressions, quotes and actions. At a fundamental level the seem to love each other, but as with many long - term relationships, they sometimes reach the point that they cannot stand the sight of one another. But Metallica has undoubtedly been a beast to others as well."
5747,"Instead, the film starts off with the nice Tookie Williams who has kind eyes and a nature that evokes sympathy. STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits A true story depicting the story of Crips founder Stanley' Tookie' Williams, played by Jamie Foxx. Tookie Williams admits that he regretted the things he did and for that, he deserves to be granted clemency. Jamie Foxx, up to this point an underrated actor, displays amazing range in his portrayal of Williams. This movie gets two thumbs up for a well directed, well acted, well portrayed story of Mr. Williams."
8167,"The Animation, while not up to the caliber of Mulan, is still fairly good. The only good thing in this is that the two trios are endearing, if show - stealers, but not by much. It goes by the clever name Mulan II. The same sort of fun, silly jokes as Mulan. True the animation is far from movie standards but it's still pretty darn good."
5749,"Enter Ms. Briski with cameras in tow. It would certainly take a filmmaker of much self - consciousness, something which Zana Briski certainly possesses, to make this film the way she has. The others: Gour, Puja, Tapasi, and Suchitra all show a unique ability to find beauty in their ugly environment. One of the best documentaries of 2004. The resulting pictures that the children took between the years 2000 and 2003 are striking."
5750,"He is a very talented musician, its amazing how many instruments he can play and with such skill. What makes it special is the examination of the complex contrasting personalities and the ironies of success and failure. Ondi Timoner has done a great job of piecing together one of the best music documentaries that makes you always wanting more. Knowing that it was made on such a shoestring budget over 7 years it is amazing that such a story can be told, especially with such style and substance. The movie centers around the Brian Jonestown Massacre."
5751,"Perfectly complementing the almost mythic personalities are the ridiculously massive and powerful waves themselves. Beginning with the early ages of surfing (a brief history lesson) lasting all the way till Laird's infamous ride, Riding Giants goes further into the mind, heart, and soul of the sport than any of these other documentaries. The waves are simply huge, and even though you may have seen quality shots in "" Blue Crush "", you haven't seen them on this grand and wild a scale. Using teams and jet skis, Hamilton's vision and drive radically changed the mindset of what was possible as surfing entered the 21st century. Everything from the structure, to the players, to the amazing stock footage, to even the style in which this was filmed only reinforced the beauty and power behind the sport of surfing."
5814,"Klaus Nomi was certainly an interesting character. The amazing, and short - life of Klaus Nomi proves this adage. Possessing a unique look and a phenomenal voice, he seemed poised for a measure of stardom during the early 1980s. Weird, but considering Nomi's legacy, probably appropriate. This is a remarkable compilation of interviews, live shows, home videos, and more all bringing together the short but phenomenal career of Klaus Nomi."
4930,"Timothy Olyphant and Chris Marquette's work on this movie was simply priceless. It kicks in at the exact right moment and manages to capture everything about this innocent, pure, high school romance. But what makes The Girl Next Door stand out from the rest is the superb cast. There is one very memorable kiss which takes place at a party, while David Gray's "" This Years Love "" plays in the background. This movie has plenty of twists and turns, so come along for the ride and have some fun."
5753,"Of course, the footage is amazing, particularly the pieces on Bill O'Reilly. What comes out as obvious is the fact that, as a person puts it, this form of control is even more vicious than authoritarian governments: leaving the people "" free "" of believing that they are indeed free and well informed is a machiavelic way of control. One effective montage shows how FNC anchors use variations of "" some people say "" to spout their own opinion as news. The movie itself is well made, even though the first 20 minutes or so have a bit of sloppy editing. When you hear a keyword like "" flip flopper "" repeated by a dozen different anchors / pundits in 1 - second shots strung together it is really impressive."
5755,"It is a story about values and truths that far exceed sports and movies. As accomplished as "" Unforgiven "" and "" Mystic River "", yet even more personal, this film is a triumph of human storytelling. Forming an iron triangle forged from mutual dependence, Dunn and Dupris school the impulsive but untutored Maggie in both the techniques of boxing and the tradecraft of survival in a world pre-disposed to pulverise individualism. His best pal and wise - man assistant (Morgan Freemna) stands alongside them, as the plot unwinds steadily, seamlessly, picking up speed, scene by scene, act after act. In MILLION DOLLAR BABY, though, Eastwood the director brings a fresh eye and an entirely fresh approach to both the setting and characterisations, virtually re-inventing this venerable sub-genre rather than simply recycling its conventions."
6507,"A few moments in time but moments that create a smile. The film provides a few minutes of amusement and is very well crafted. There are a few laughs and all the cast do a very good job. However, from the very first moment, the movie grabs your attention and puts you in the shoes of Ben. The amount of detail put into such a short amount of time certainly makes the film worthy of all the awards it has received at various festivals."
5759,"It is gripping, heart - wrenching, and opens your eyes to so many things. For years, he's turned in one superb performance after another. Even more so for Sophie Okonedo as she truly did a magnificent job for a supporting role. Okonedo and Cheadle are utterly believable as a couple. It's based on a true event, about Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu who worked at four star hotel in Kigali."
4924,"He delivered a nice sum of laughs and for once wasn't a completely pointless character. instead of action, it plays it purely for laughs, turning the original streetwise tough - guy cops in to fumbling buffoons. Ben Stiller had four movies come out in six months and this one was the best. In the by - the - numbers, police procedural screenplay, Starsky and Hutch trace the floater back to Feldman. Altogether, while its boasts several funny scenes, this "" Starsky & Hutch "" remake doesn't amount to much."
4923,"This is a beautifully filmed movie, stunning in some parts. Sets and production design are spellbinding and the Oriental landscapes are mesmerizing. The photography and the landscapes are just astonishing; and the work of Mortensen is so remarkable. Expect moments of triumph and humor that make you laugh and cheer, as well as moments of tragedy. One of the best parts of this movie is the fact that it is a movie by grownups for grownups, although it carries enough action and suspense that kids will probably like it to."
5762,"The light is superb, the framing, everything. Korea must be an interesting place to make movies. His adventures are far richer than the confines of a suburban definition of paradise. This new movie, "" 3 - Iron "", shows the best of ki - Duk's soul and senses. This movie is a treat in this day and age of "" talkie "" movies with too much exposition and dialog."
5763,"Coupled with his amazing performances is the work of everyone else involved. It's a visually beautiful film with loads of odd little CG touches and subtle visual gags. Excellent music, great acting, teary moments, and action - packed rescues make this a definite 9. The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is a beautiful film. Maybe you got very smart girl among you who could solve everything (Eleanor)."
5764,"Blanchett's performance is simply stunning. Wonderful performances by all the cast and the time "" flew "" by. Her look, her mannerisms, and her speech perfectly match the screen legend to a haunting degree. As for the performances, they are amazing (thanks in most part to Scorsese, the ultimate actor's director). Importantly, DiCaprio more than holds his own when paired with Cate Blanchett and especially Alan Alda, who both give equally note worthy performances."
5765,"Her performance visually (i. e. expressions etc) is mesmerizing. The costumes and the scenery were Beautiful. It is a visually stunning movie - the costuming and sets are as extravagant and lavish as the music. Minnie Driver, Miranda Richarardson - all great. The theatre set itself was absolutely stunning; marble and velvet being the main materials within it."
5766,"She comes across as a very positive and nice person, a lot more than Darin whose problems are shown as well as his good points. He's spent the last 12 years making this project perfect, and has received blessings from both Sandra Dee and her son with Bobby, Dodd. Spacey's strong ties to his own mother have been reported and Bobby Darin's relationship with his mother is at the focal point of the story, as well as Sandra Dee's, Darin's wife. Kevin Spacey's acting captures the essence of BD; after the first ten minutes of the movie it seemed that Kevin Spacey WAS Bobby Darin irrespective of age. Which makes it okay that he doesn't look 20 in the early scenes."
5767,"It was quite a popular film at the festival, especially with all the Oscars - buzz surrounding Kevin Bacon due to this film. It's not an easy film to watch, but the performances are all good, the story's riveting and it's definitely one of the best, most thought - provoking films of the year. Anyway, this movie can be appreciated by spectators and they can admire an actor complete and mature, perhaps one of the rare actors in USA's cinema of today. Well, it has it's ups and downs. However, monologues are used to great effect."
5769,"Aside from the humor, this is the crux of Meet the Fockers. But many of the variations are quite inspired. Blythe Danner gives a decent performance, nothing really special. The writers came up with a bunch of different, funny situations and some of them were recycled while others were new. It's a great mix of slap - stick, witty banter, strong comedic performances, crude humor and even cutesy fowl mouthed toddlers."
5770,The performances here are just as compelling and the 70s look of the film is absolutely perfect. Director / Co-writer Niels Mueller has crafted a stunning work that is clearly heart - felt. Sean Penn is Sean Penn--just the best that there is and this is as great as anything he has ever done. The theater in Toronto was over a thousand seats and was packed. The scenes hum with a slowburn intensity and gradually build up a momentum that lunges to the film's explosive final act.
5771,"It has distinct characters, a thoroughly engaging story, beautiful cinematography, and wonderful performances. With many citations of important writers, the dramatic story has excellent lines and is very positive, with good messages and a well resolved conclusion. That anyone could alter the ennui in the way Pursey changes things is a minor miracle. Gabriel Macht is very good and Scarlett Johansson, the greatest talent of her young generation, too. She decides to share the place living together with them and after their initial difficult relationship, they disclose deep secrets and improve their lives."
5772,"Antonio is a complex character; part loyal friend, part melancholy contemplative, part religious bigot and part enterprising capitalist. Jeremy Irons plays Antonio, as other reviewers have noted, as an "" aging queen ""; the line readings and gestures make it clear that he is in love with Bassanio. This is one of the best Shakespeare adaptations of recent years; an intelligent and visually attractive look at a complex play. ' The Merchant of Venice' is one of Shakespeare's better - known plays and is still regularly performed in the theatre. It goes without saying, that the location shots, costumes, and interiors were breathtaking, almost to the point of distraction."
5773,"A decent story for all others. The surreal, dreamy humor was represented mostly through Momoko. Kyoko Fukada's acting is perfect, she makes what she does better: an ingenuous little girl. Nakashima Tetsuya's wonderful "" Shimotsuma Monogatari "" (Shimotsuma Story) is quite a unique and charming film. The film makes the most of this simple plot line, and it's the compelling personalities of the characters, beautifully overplayed by Kyoko Fukada and Anna Tsuchiya, respectively."
5774,"This is an extremely enjoyable film with laughs galore. Like Garfirld and Scooby Doo, another great cartoon character comes to life. The only really enjoyable scenes in the movie were the ones with Bill Cosby. But "" Fat Albert "" succeeds on so many levels, it's amazing a film this good can even be made in 2004. A lot of the scenes in the movie seemed as though they were for occupying space and time more than for aiding the plot."
5775,"' In the Realms of the Unreal' uses several gimmicky visual devices. Because Yu has no footage of Darger, and only a handful of photographs of him, she resorts to re-enactments. The decision to make animated cartoons from several Darger murals is a good one, and the stiff - legged' lazy' animation technique used here is appropriate to the material. Less commendable is Yu's decision at several points to use new artwork that paraphrases Darger's themes; audiences will mistake these images for actual Darger artwork. For most of his life, Darger lived in one room of the house of Nathan Lerner, an aspiring artist in his own right who ultimately made his impact in the art world as the curator of Darger's work."
4921,"The lead pair Diego Luna and Romola Garai share a nice chemistry. Not only is Garai beautiful but she can act too as she delivers a sincere performance. Romola was fabulous and Diego was just so easy to watch. There were some great foot - tapping songs and the dances were fairly good too. They have an interesting chemistry, (although not as prominent as the characters interaction in the original, which is a slight disappointment)."
4920,"But it wasn't really good, although it had good parts. It is a full - fledged slasher film, but they are obviously having a lot of fun with it. They are two totally different style movies. From Sam the fun police to Jenni (played by the super hot Brittney Daniel) each charecter was histarical. In Pleasure Island, Costa Rica, a serial killer slashes the employees of the Coconut Beach Resort, a paradisiacal place for having sex and fun."
5982,"Rating: Good, the picture has its sensational moments, mostly provided by its agile star, the great Jackie Chan. Awesome, incredible stunts and brief comic touches, as usual; the picture is better constructed than its predecessor. This is a breath of fresh air from his last few big duds. The action sequences and stunts are downright sensational; the highlight being an excessively destructive bus - out - of - control scene through the crowded streets of Hong Kong. Jackie's partner is Nicholas Tse, who did a lot of his own stunts in this movie."
5784,"Like heavyweight stuff, like Burtolucci and those guys. This film is chock - full of little surprises, many of them funny. The valedictorian speech is a hoot and a half--got a big laugh! Leavened with a good dose of humor the film none - the-less is a listless addition to the quasi - genre of suburban angst films. Hirsch plays out the character quite well, revealing frame after frame in the visual expression of his body, a host of conflicting emotions inside the soul of a kid whom no one seems to listen to or know very well, unknowing and unaware of his depth of soul and prodigious talent."
5788,"But as talented as he may be, no one can recreate the subtleties of the master, especially the use of his eyes Despite the fact that virtually the whole show centers around Rush and his masterful performance, he is backed up by a strong supporting cast and crew. This is not necessarily the film's fault; the movie is mostly well - cast (only John Lithgow as Blake Edwards didn't seem quite right) and beautiful to look at, from the opening credits on. The rest of the casting is excellent too, particularly Charlize Theron as the second "" B. E. "" in Seller's life, Britt Ekland. John Lighgow is Blake Edwards, the man who elevated the actor to an international acclaim."
5789,"Here's a bit of everything, violence and fighting scenes, hi - tech armory, some love and some conspiracy as well. The environments and characters really seemed like living, breathing versions of the ones in Akira and Ghost in the Shell. As a whole product, it's graphical presentation rivals that of great 2D animation features. But about forty minutes in people began laughing. The range of emotions expressed through the CG is impressive; and motion capture has worked beautifully into the film, making it a seamless viewing experience."
4919,"It works in so many different levels that it would be impossible to list them. However, the overall effect is that there isn't anything sanitized in this film; it's an according - to - the - Book account and after you see this on film, it shakes you up. The scenes are so believable, the violence so real, that the scenes appear to take place in your very presence; imagine before you a man being torn to bloody shreds; your helpless to do anything, you're a spectator - utterly horrific. As an historical observation, the film is brilliant, depicting the social and political dynamics of the Romans and Sanhedrin with clarity and accessibility. Its dialogue is entirely in Latin and Aramaic, with English subtitles, a remarkably bold decision by Gibson, and one that pays dividends."
4918,"Naturally the four fresh - faced kids get into all sorts of hijinks as they make their way through London, Paris, Berlin, Rome, and so on. Along for the ride with Scotty are his friend Cooper (who looks and sounds like David Spade) and twins Jenny and Jamie. Eurotrip uses almost every single clichÃ© or stereotype regarding Europe & exaggerates it enormously in an unbelievably funny way. Eurotrip follows the adventures of four teens, Scott (Scott Mechlowitz), Cooper (Jacob Pitts), and twins Jamie (Travis Wester) and Jenny (Trachtenberg) as they backpack around Europe between high school graduation and beginning college. With a strong cast, plenty of well written gags and an overall cheesy script - EuroTrip is definitely a winner."
6451,"This is a highly intelligent, informative, sometimes humorous and superbly edited series of programmes that look at two types of dominant fundamentalist groups that exist in the Twenty First Century. What makes this documentary so outstanding is not just that it clearly exposes many of the myths of the so - called "" War on Terror, "" but the fact that it places the power of these myths in a larger and very important context. Part documentary, part essay, part brilliantly edited collage, Curtis tracks the rise and rise of two groups: the American neo-cons and the radical Islamists. This remarkable documentary, well written, researched, and articulate, traces the odd, parallel paths of the rise and failures of the Islamist movement and the movement of the American neoconservatives. In the next decades some of his followers like Paul Wolfowitz, John Ashcroft or William Kristol set about putting his ideas into practice, first during the cold war and now during the Bush - era."
5798,"Robert Stadlober is in great shape acting, as well as the whole of the cast. It's one of the rare film in which everything fits together, the acting, the music, the dramatic art, the fun, the dialogs. The performance by the award winning Robert Stadlober (Best Leading Actor at the Montreal Film Festival , 2001) was particularly standout. Kreuzpaintner is able to capture the feelings of the protagonists in a very subtle and convincing way. A well - made coming - of - age tale for everyone (except for conservative prudes and pre-teens), definitely worth your time."
5799,"A perfect script, made in real life 59 years ago. But "" Der Untergang "" is awesome and comparable to "" Apocalypse Now! "" As Traudl Junge, the young secretary, Alexandra Maria Lara gives a subtle performance. Pity because in many respects, she convincingly stole the show. Ulrich Matthes as Joseph Goebbels and Heino Ferch as Albert Speer are equally effective playing these two men."
4917,"The whole aspect of a girl with a dream moving from New York City the dream city with the lights, sparkle and Broadway to a small basic town in New Jersey. Lohan does a great job playing the "" drama queen "" and for the most part her character is believable. It's also fairly obvious how her new best friend will react to any revelations. The "" arch-enemy "" gets the better moments and is well played by Megan Fox, who really keeps her nails well - filed and ready to scratch. No offense to Duff, but Lohan is a much better actress and has proved that in films with scripts so much more intelligent than this one."
4916,"The movie is better than its IMDb rating would indicate. You can't hate a story when it comes from true events and both Shaloub and Ryan pull off their characters with finesse. Omar Epps fares a bit better, turning in a performance of strength and dignity, though the script lets him down by failing to develop his character to any appreciable extent. Helgenberger would have brought credible toughness and credible sexuality to the role. The film will like to Meg Ryan fans and boxing buffs but displays nice combats."
4949,"The physical casting of the two leads is very good. However, don't expect a sugary sweet fairy tale story: while it is sweet, the story has many modern twists and plenty of humour thrown in for good measure (Scotty the roommate and Soren the butler / caretaker are, quite simply, hilarious). Paige's girlfriends are a great collection and the the Prince's valet is very funny. There was a nice touch with the pacing of the film and the close - ups provided by director Martha Coolidge. And of course, Paige teaches Eddie about love and work ethic, while Eddie teaches Paige about poetry and the pains and pleasures of wealth and privilege."
4908,"It's well worth seeing, and it is a must - see for fans of Romano. The extras are very nice and complimentary. Ray Romano stars, and he proves himself to be quite an excellent comedian on the big screen. The show is a big hit sensation, and the two characters Ray Romano play, in personality and such, are very similiar. But his arrival to his hometown of Mooseport had caused some spectacle of sorts."
4907,"Sandler is great in this film and he is one of the funniest comedians around today. Rating 8/10 one of the funniest movies of the year and a must see if you want a good comedy. There are more laughs in this than in another, perhaps more pretentious picture, "" Punch Drunk Love "". Rob Schneider has a small role in this film but he still manages to draw some laughs. Chances are very good that you will enjoy it."
5805,"Romola Garai is amazingly gorgeous and brilliant in her role. This is definitely one of the finest examples of film this year, telling a very relevant story in a simple way. O'Donnell manages to tell this story with extraordinary grace and humor. This is a must - see film for everyone. Their acting was excellent, there was this real lifelike feeling between them, that made you really believe they were the characters they were acting out."
5806,"Yagira's outstanding performance is original and remarkable, and simply unforgettable. this is largely because of the superb performances of the adorable children, who were all really natural and likable. Particularly, the eyes of the eldest boy, Akira, are very impressive. Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Nobody Knows is the performances of the four children. The content of "" Maborosi "" is too thin, but the images and color are exquisite and the sequences of natural, unrehearsed - looking scenes achieve an impressively rich, beautiful, zen - like calm."
5807,"Matt Dillon and Christina Applegate have both done quite well. It was kinda funny, in - fact really funny in some parts. Beyond that point, it's Wild Things. Steve Zahn, as the crazy Jack, does amazing things. The characters were well fleshed out and the story took such surprising and hilarious turns."
5813,"The expressions and the nuances and the emotion captured in this film are truly breathtaking. Now is a great time, as many of his films are available on home DVD. There a few clunky moments in the plot line where transitions between story points weren't very strong, but overall it's another outstanding film from Studio Ghibli. It has all of the classic stunning Miyazaki panoramas, rich settings, exciting and unusual machinery, and brilliantly conceived creatures that are often humorous and fanciful. About a decade and a half ago, Hayao Miyazaki, the mogul of Japanese cinema, burst into the Hollywood scene with the delightful' Castle in the Sky . '"
4900,"A documentary with the DVD shows the great lengths they went to in filming this in order make the action look realistic. A must - see for sports fans and non-fans alike. He elongated his vowels very well. Herb Brooks was a remarkable person, long before Lake Placid. According to the film, Brooks is relatively new to these techniques which he adopted while studying USSR hockey."
5817,"The musical numbers are a joy to watch. Ash Rai did a great job and Martin Henderson was just perfect for the role of Mr. Darcy. The scene moves between Amritsar and Goa to London and Beverley Hills, all in brighter - than - bright super-saturated colour, with an assortment of equally colourful characters, wonderful costumes, lavish dance pieces and heavenly bollywood - style ballads. Go and see this film if you are open to something new - it really is quite a faithful re-work of the story, and it is very entertaining. This movie delicately and playfully bridges the gap between the two genres, which is not an easy task."
4898,"It is worth 90 minutes of your time. To the detailed observer you may even find a few ironic twists and laughs throughout the movie Some almost assuredly intended and some only fate could have delivered. You'll not remember it 5 minutes after the credits role but for a non-threatening, easy - going movie The Perfect Score fits nicely. One of the best aspects the director and writer brought to this was to poke fun at some of the Aspects that will remind you of other films and popular teen television shows. Many important things, like the students grades in school, are not taken care of."
4897,"There are some great performances hidden here. There are some nice shots of scenery, even if a lot of them are composites. Actually, it's a vacuously enjoyable, if occasionally rather desperate comedy with some nice, sun - bleached photography, and a few funny scenes. The scenes of Hawaii and the beautiful shoreline and water are the only good things to be taken from this. When it ends, you want to kick someone - the director or producers or studio financiers - for stopping what COULD have been so great!"
5915,"The characters are well written; the plot well told and the actors, especially, the kid playing Chava are very good. First time actor Carlos Padilla portrays Chava in the film, and his outstanding performance is a credit as much to director Luis Mandoki as it is to himself. The gorgeous Leonor "" Cleopatra "" Varela also shows she is much more than a pretty face, putting in a very moving performance as Chava's mother. You can see that these are real people going through a great ordeal, unlike "" Salvador "" or even "" Romero "" whose characters and plots were obviously made up based on facts read on news papers. The rest of the cast is also routinely superb, including Spaniard Daniel GimÃ©nez Cacho as the priest and Jesus Ochoa (uncredited on IMDb) as the bus driver."
4976,"O'Toole was awesome (like there ever was a doubt) every scene Sean Bean was in boosted the credability of the film. It is truly a much richer, perhaps even exciting experience, as your expectations have been lowered, and often this makes a movie - watching experience better. The rest of the cast is good enough with a special note for Peter O'Toole and Brian Cox. And those thousand ships, battles, and numerous special effects certainly please the eye. Rose Byrne and Brian Cox were the two surprise packets, delivering powerful and believable performances."
5197,"The songs chosen for the different scenes matched the purpose and the flow of the scene and tremendously enhanced the viewer's experience. As a result these movies are satisfying, meeting some deep rooted needs but in novel and refreshing ways. The DVD (Canadian version if it is different) was also well made and had a number of decent extra features. Wonderful new characters (you have to love the pussy in boots), superb animation and a all - round well made movie for everyone to enjoy. Both use latest technology to create a hyper - real quality which goes beyond their forerunners to create a feel that the viewer is seeing something that has not been seen before."
5198,"In that regard the film carries all the usual problems that the genre carries but happily benefits from the fact that the effects are much better than 1970's movies could manage. All this film does is to provide spectacle and moments of dramatic action â€“ if you want to think about it then you will only hurt your enjoyment of the action. Except for the over-exaggerated and extremely erroneous scare tactics of this movie, and a ridiculous portrayal of the Vice Preseint of the United States, the movie works strictly as an entertaining fantasy - adventure story. Well - intentioned it may be, but the movie's plot takes second place to the imagery - the opening credits over an icy landscape, the massive weather systems over the planet, colossal hailstones pelting down on Tokyo, snowstorms over India, tidal waves - and the numerous effects houses make it an eye candy feast, especially for people with a grudge against the Big Apple (kudos to Industrial Light and Magic, Digital Domain and all the less renowned FX companies involved). So on that level, it works; the music by Harald Kloser and Thomas Wanker is also a bonus, being more restrained and serious in its support than is usually the way with Emmerich movies."
5199,""" Raising Helen "" deals with the trials and tribulations of Helen as she comes to terms with her new situation. Ms. Cusack is a treasure in this movie. But she makes it real, as if she is a real character with someone inside pulling strings violently. The two of them actually have pretty good chemistry, and the three kids are cute without being annoying. It had some very funny moments, and some very tender moments."
5200,"But it has enough laughs to be worth looking at. This movie hit those stereotypes in such an amusing way. Some jokes play better than others, but with the right attitude, the movie proves to be fun. Kevin Hart, Tom Arnold, Snoop Dog, K. D. Cubert, the funny Mo' nique, and the beautiful Sofia Vergara make this a movie with a lot of laughs. The director has gathered a lot of talented black entertainers in a comedy that is best watched with a lot of friends because there are some hysterical moments in it that are a riot."
5824,"The cinematography is excellent: the camera - work is superb, the mood is perfect, the effects are beautifully rendered (and not overused), and the timing of individual scenes is consistent throughout the piece. It just has that kind of history and interesting terms and names and events that make you go, "" Wow! The closing titles background song was pretty cool. Final verdict: not for all tastes, but refreshing and worth watching, at least once. The reason for the Jeunet comparison (e. g. Delicatessen, City of Lost Children) is that it has the same dark antiutopian / surrealistic ambiance to it, and is very imaginative."
5202,"is one of this year's best movies. All others may find it worth the price of the rental. It's funny and clever and outdoes all' teen - comedies' by transcending the genre. It so poignantly captures the hardships and comedies of being a teenage girl. Jena Malone continues and deepens her fine work from Donnie Darko, creating one of the most moving teen heroines in memory."
5825,"The cinematography is more sophisticated, with an authentic 1930s aura. The setting is great with some nice scenes of old Hong Kong and the way people used to live. It rivals Hollywood features in every category (set, costumes cinematography), but amazingly enough the CGI is really good! The impressive action is thanks largely to the great choreography talent including both Sammo Hung and Yuen Wo Ping (each working on the film at spate occasions). Yuen Wo Ping manages to take a scene that appears to be rehash of the Burly Brawl (hundreds of suits against one guy) and manages to make it not only fresh, but a thousand times more exciting and intense."
5204,"It has a really good atmosphere and good actors. Things take a very unexpected turn when one of the team gets killed. The death scenes are also pretty good even if they are unrealistic. Although not being exceptional, "" Mindhunters "" is a good thriller and slash movie. Their teacher is Jake Harris (Val Kilmer) who likes to use special methods while training his agents."
5926,"The movie is full of emotions acted pretty well. all in all, the edukators is a breath of fresh air that is both satisfying to the head and the heart. The camera which makes u feel to be very close to the scenes and the music support these emotions successfully. The four main characters were cast exceptionally well, and the dialog--whew! A very interesting, psychologically well developed film, that starts from the rather simple (the whole of the establishment are' a wunch of bankers', as the British say) and then becomes more complex."
5206,"Otherwise, chances are good that you will. Just had fun watching TCOR and am pretty happy about it. The direction, special effects, plot, music, screenplay, cast performance, and entertainment value are all truly fabulous! The action scenes in this film were great! And Thandie Newton was a really good "" baddie ""!"
5207,"Details are important to the loyal fans. As a family movie it is entertaining, but Garfield - the movie seems to have ignored the comedy that made him everyone's favourite cat; only traces of it still remain. Kinda dragged in parts of the movie, but the humorous attitude of Garfield makes it bearable to take your kids to. It's worth watching as a family movie, but for fans of the Jim Davis comic character, it's probably best left alone. As for the product placements, yes, they were a bit much, but at least part of the time they were well integrated."
5208,"The original was a gem, with excellent acting by Katharine Ross, Paula Prentiss, and Patrick O'Neal. This movie is a perfect example of what is wrong with the state of movies today. All the pretty, golden - hued settings, and Matthew Broderick's emergence as a' good guy with a heart' who saves the day can't compensate for the quagmire of a plot. The dialogue was pretty intelligent, the plot twists weren't given away in the first 15 minutes, and the ending was a real shocker. Some of the cartoonish humor (though over-the-top) is entertaining and colorful, and the movie's first 45 minutes are good, but the thicker the plot gets, the more ridiculous the film becomes."
5209,"In terms of story, this one is tops. One of the funniest parts about this movie is that it IS so accurate. This movie is quite possibly the funniest movie ever. It's not a fall - out - of - your - chair - in - hysterics funny, it's more of a constant - giggling - over-the-silliness-of-it-all funny. There are Napoleons, Pedros, Summers, Debs, and Dons in EVERY American High School."
5227,"Indeed, this is what happened to Spurlock, however the magnitude of the health deterioration was astounding. But Spurlock never claimed it was entirely realistic! Morgan Spurlock undoubtedly aspires to follow in the path of Errol Morris, Roger Moore, Joel Sucher and other leading documentarians. Spurlock is a great presenter, however, because he is just a regular guy who has a great amount of charm and good camera presence. Spurlock decided to eat at McDonald's and only McDonald's for a full month."
4974,"Combined with the extravagant visuals and quickly changing, sprawling locations, the result is epic in scope. The look of the film is lush, with lots of unusual point of view shots, exotic locations and computer - generated environments. Van Helsing is a great Sunday afternoon video. The makers of this film are clearly fans of the genre. Everyone, including Van Helsing's friar sidekick is a magnificent specimen."
5246,"As with the original movie, cameo appearances are a small but welcome treat. She is attractive, in a cutesy sort of way but she has a charm and a likeability that works very well and the three leads seem to have a good chemistry. The set designs, cinematography and special effects are really excellent. Of course there are funny parts. As far as fight - scenes go, they are well choreographed and Jackie can luckily still kick ass."
4895,She was always so upbeat and happy as Rosalee Futch. Both male leads are played pretty well. Josh Duhamel plays Tad and he gives a decent performance. Topher Grace is very funny and entertaining as Pete. Josh Duhamel was great playing what you would think of a guy like him.
5248,"Ben Stiller does a routine that's absolutely hysterical. A true film for any Ben Stiller fan, that's for sure. Alan Tudyk, Rip Torn, Christine Taylor and Stephen Root are a great ensemble. It's one of the best comedies of the year and a lot funnier than it should be given the flimsy premise. Ben Stiller was funny as always and Vince Vaughn was surprisingly funny."
5249,"The same thing with the Zeta Jones character: everything she said had to be done with her eyes and tears. The Terminal is an incredible fairy tale of a movie - it's quietly captivating, rich in interesting colorful characters and superbly acted and directed. Many of the good things from that script are also presented here in diverse and creative ways. It's a very different type of movie - for all the strategically placed product adds, there's something quietly uncommercial about Terminal and watching it is an interesting experience. By the way, the art direction / set decoration is amazing as everything within the titled location was built from scratch in a studio."
5250,"Life has many of these moments. In terms of characterisation Auerbach also got things right. The photography is absolutely marvellous; it hardly needs anything else. Such precious, subtle moments make for a tremendous piece of film - making. The direction is brilliant, the acting brilliant or Aerbach got lucky."
5251,"Terry Crews was excellent as Latrell Spencer and was a good touch to the movie. Frankie Faison was alright playing the chief and delivered a few clever scenes. This movie makes fun of everyone--black, white, rich, poor, dorks, cool people. One of the best things about the film is that they didn't use the same jokes that every other comedy movie based on someone dressing up as someone else and pretending to be them. The plot is very unreal, something you won't see in the real life, but if you pass over this things you'll see one of the best comedies."
5252,"The story is compelling from the opening credits to the closing credits. Gosling is best known for his role as "" Richie "", one of the kids, in Murder By Numbers. And yet the wonderful thing about this movie is that it takes what seems like a story you've heard already (at least in bits and pieces) and still moves you deeply. The scenes during the opening credits is absolutely breathtaking. All of the actors turn in engrossing and compelling performances."
5253,"Ooooooooooo, big amount of talent for that. Also, it portrays a great performances by the Tigers. Wonderful graphics, exotic views, well mixed sound, good music, great story, interesting point of views. All parents should take their kids to watch such movies, it will make them love and care for animals. You begin to love the tigers from the very first second you see them on screen, and your heart breaks every time something happens to them."
5254,"This movie works on so many levels. Even if De-Lovely is not historically correct, Kevin Kline's performance is outstanding. DE-LOVELY is not an easy movie but it is a brilliant one. Although production values are good for a period and location piece, it feels a little less grand in scope than it ought to be. A special mention to the make - up artists, who do a fabulous job in aging the characters over several decades."
4894,"On the more peaceful moments it sounds real well. Kutcher seemed to do what he does best. Still, he holds his own in plenty of scenes. The previews looked very intense and the whole film is pretty much like that. As for the technical feats, The Butterfly Effect is very well done."
5833,"That said, the footage is superb, the sense of a grunt's life very well evoked, with individual personalities nicely delineated. It must be good since so many other directors are using a similar format in upcoming documentaries. There is a lot of very scraggly video of nighttime raids. To learn more about the making of the movie, check out the Apple computers website, and Gunner Palace website. If only to see the faces of the soldiers and citizens in Iraq, as they are actually living, this film is worth seeing."
5834,"In Lior Ashkenazi, the director has found a charismatic Eyal. This is a unique film that has several layers all happening at once. Sometimes the opening credits predict a great deal about the film itself. The music by Esther and Abi Ofarim and the nice mixture of German, Englicsh and Hebrew made the movie most enjoyable. This film's credits are pretty conventional, only they are in English."
5281,"With that said, FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is the most important film in the history of cinema. Also, Moore does an excellent job of outlining the Bush insiders and their ties to the oil industry. Ultimately, all audiences, regardless of their political proclivities, should be able to see that Moore is anything but anti-American or anti-democratic. Understand that the facts are the facts, the presentation is Mr. Moore's, and your opinion is your own. Nothing here is new to anyone who has spent any time perusing the alternative or progressive media in the past four years, but the effect is substantial because Moore has finally shown himself to be a true documentarian, and has woven together a coherent picture of the connections between the players and the events from December 2000 to the present."
4973,"It definitely isn't being advertised as anything else. A fun story of mayhem and mischief, it is far from the worst movie out this season (have you SEEN "" Van Helsing ""? a pair of twins, each of whom is very different. The Olsen's produce family friendly movies which are enjoyable for what they are. The Twins are growing up and are doing quite well for them selves."
5285,"movies are best in the cinema! He truly embodies the spirit of J. Jonah Jameson. Two thumbs up on the music. The performances were top rate, especially Alfred Molina's portrayal of Dr. Otto Octavius. The first and third' Spider - Man' movies were simply fantastic."
5286,"Some scenes are extremely well done. Anyway, the performances by Hawke and Delpy are wonderful once again. Everything in this film was connected and worked to the fullest extent of cinematic possibility. They have grown and emerged as two important commodities in the Hollywood community. This is probably Hawke's greatest performance in years."
5287,"Most times you see a Directors Cut you might get an extra scene here bit of dialog's there and you ask yourself what was the point of shelling out the extra money to see basically the same movie, in the case of King Arthur, you haven't seen anything until you see the Directors Cut. Only a few centuries early eh Jerry! The fight scenes between the various groups of people vying for control of Briton are good, visually stunning and intense. The movie is beautifully shot with a variety of landscapes ranging from Hadrian's Wall to icy snow - covered hills and peasant villages. The movie King Arthur has it all - a tight, well written story, believable characters, gritty realism, a great musical score by Hans Zimmer, epic battles, and more blood and splatter than you probably really wanted to see."
5288,"Ferrell (who co-wrote the film) is his usual manic self, unctuous but likable, and Applegate, Paul Rudd, Steve Carell, David Koechner, and Fred Willard do fine work in supporting roles. This is Will Ferrel at his best and it will be hard to top. Enter pretty but tough Veronica Corningstone, Christina Applegate. The only redeeming qualities of the movie are Steven Carell and Jack Black's brief scene with Baxter, the dog. Will Ferrell is genius in playing Ron straight without character dispersions."
5289,"Sporting a superior blonde' Farrah' reminiscent of nasty Caroline (Haviland Morris) in Hughes' Sixteen Candles (1984), you just know that Staci's a bitch with a heart of gold. Her best friend Hannah, played by Mika Boorem, is the only person who seemed to know how to show emotion. you "" However this film had only one true intentionally funny part, when the jerk - for - even - thinking - of - kissing - his - girlfriend high school boyfriend and his new girlfriend are trying to win the dance contest, their slow jerky dance movements were the only bright spot in an otherwise idiotic film. Sleepover is just an above average teenie - bopper movie with some really fun moments and nice performances by a talented young cast. There are a couple of very funny scenes from Steve Carell who plays an over-the-top security guard looking to break up the girl's fun."
5290,"Despite a few corny moments, the film does a great job of being genuinely funny. Samantha (Duff) showed girl power and her true colors in the end of the movie towards Austin (Murray) and Fiona (Jennifer Cooliedge). So for adults, at least, A Cinderella Story is going to be successful or not dependent on how well it hikes its well - trodden path. But also, for the guys, hot chicks galore, and for the girls, fit AND soulful blokes. Chad Michael Murray, who played Austin was good as well, although he looked about 5 or 10 years older then Duff but he was good in the role."
5291,"His performance is intelligent, marred by occasional "" Gotcha, suckaz! "" This past weekend seems to confirm that, since the universally - panned "" Fantastic Four "" broke the slump. Will Smith's acting is a naturalistic shuffle, a Columbo - like pastiche of mumbling, sarcasm, and unexpected outbursts of charisma and off - balancing interrogation techniques. But it is also good fun and, along with Spiderman 2, stands out as one of the best of this years generally disappointing crop of blockbusters. Nonetheless, in rare moments, she invests the character's personal revelations with warmth, doubt, and a glow of determination and moral purpose."
5292,"Catalina Sandino Moreno has awesome performance and this film really deserves the nomination for Oscar and another twenty - seven (27) wins and twenty - one (21) nominations in Festivals. The lovely Ms. Moreno, in an Oscar - worthy debut performance, is no cardboard character but a fully developed human being who epitomizes the desperation of people who are willing to do almost anything to better their life. The narration is lineal and relays absolutely in the work of the two main actresses, and this is the success of the movie, the work of the two girls is superb, they transmit lots of energy in the screen, and although sometimes the decisions of the characters are quite sudden, their interpretation makes them absolutely believable. Is admirable how a person that had never been in Colombia, before the movie, understands the problem and shows it in a so delicate and powerful way, and is able to put it in the big screen without extremes so common in films about Latin America made by foreign directors, as an example watch Len Loach's Carla's Song. Unusually well managed without being junked up with the usual Hollywood tawdry tinsel and situational extremes, this very human drama does more pound - for - pound than most films many times its size."
5298,"Hes very good in this role, which commits a great success to the whole of the movie. It is extraordinarily refreshing to see an action film like this, even more when it accomplishes everything it sets out to do and has so much brains. In fact, the film is very efficient on the whole and it never overindulges in anything, which compensates for the amount of talking and allows it to be exciting. This made these scenes a little hard to enjoy. Some new characters are present as well, and they are good additions to the series."
5299,"Knowing only of the old Batman TV show from the 60's, the 90's Cartoon and the brilliant portrayal by Michelle Pfeiffer in Tim Burton's exceptional Batman Returns in 1992. Oh yeah the man who thought she was gonna kill herself turns up everywhere she goes, surprise surprise and cant even use his thick head to understand they are the same person, even though there is no difference in looks except a silly black thing covering her eyes."
5300,"The scenic design and location choices were notably excellent. The rest of the performances are excellent as well. It is now in DVD, and it is a good movie to see. Sissy Spacek is simply superb; aside from the tendency to like her in whatever she does, her character took only moments to become highly engaging. From a very young age, his character is aware of certain truths about life and he's acutely in touch with his feelings."
4972,"If you like teen movies then you'll find this a very good one. The other members of the Plastics shine as well. Her best scenes are with Rachel. They also give good performances and the scenes that have all the plastics together are very entertaining. Gretchen herself, played by the delectable Lacey Chabert is a character of her own, not just a cardboard minion to follow orders."
4971,"But with these traits, how is it their apartments are immaculate? Brosnan is actually becoming a much better actor than he was 6 - 7 years before. The supporting is actually also great, from Sheen, Posey, Fisher, Dunn to the locals in the Irish village. To be really interesting and re-watchable it requires that at least some of the predictabilities have twists without ruining the eventual outcome. Yes, its sweet and light and everything a good romantic comedy should be except memorable."
5925,"Extremes "" last night, and it was insanely good. "" Saam gaang yi "", a. k. a. "" 3 Extremes "", is composed of three segments (1) "" Dumplings "", by Fruit Chan, is the best segment. Wow, just went to go see these three shorts last night, which are about 45 mins a piece. These directors use powerful cinematic storytelling elements in exploring their genres. Each story has very different qualities and gave the viewer something to enjoy."
5336,"The picture packs thrills, suspense, action, intrigue and is quite entertaining. Good cast, stylish direction by Jonathan Demme (though now in his trademark style: huge close - ups of people looking right at the camera), some nice suspense. Classic movies bring the right actors together in the right combination. Thrilling and chilling film deals with Major Ben Marco (Denzel Washington), an intelligence officer in the U. S. Army. The wonderful trigger line :' Why don't you pass the time by playing a nice game of solitare? '"
5337,"Like Shyamalan's other films, it ultimately carries a message of hope and optimism. It seems that Shyamalan will always live in the shadow of his masterpiece "" The 6th sense "". And so, Shyamalan has been trying with every single outing since to recapture that sense of awe. It's a captivating tale of a very odd small town, complete with a twist, as is characteristic of director M. Night Shyamalan. Then a blind girl viewing peoples Aura's would be all very well and good."
6038,"And when everything is taken into consideration, the writers succeed. Disney has great villanslike Frolo, Hades, and Jafar just to name a few. So please try to see it with the eyes of a little kid, and you might enjoy it better. The best non-Pixar Disney film in years. Disney always makes films kids, teens, and adults alike can enjoy."
8430,"com) If you watch "" Life is WorthLosing "" for just the opening and closing segments, you will see pure brilliance. It's funny watching this eleven years after it was released and seeing just how brilliant Carlin was. Interesting to see how he has elaborated on elements of his live stage act from two years ago. This show, like all of Carlin's shows, is scathingly accurate and roll - on - the - floor funny, but this one seems to have a darker theme floating over it than most of his shows. George Carlin has his unique way to bring you his vision on everything and this in a funny sarcastic way."
8154,"The locations and cinematography were exotic and the sexy scenes were, well sexy. This is the kind of movie that will make just about everything else you see this year a pleasant movie experience. And some high - intensity love making scenes, definitely make this film worth watching. ' Three' is described as a steamy erotic thriller guaranteed to create an atmosphere so tense you can barely swallow for fear whilst at the same time it is full of hot performances with lavish sexual tension on the screen. Saved by brief sex scenes, mad witch, gorgeous desert island and Brooks body."
7749,"So one of the BBC triumphs of the decade, and unmissable in every respect! The production sparkles and one is immediately involved with the story and the characters. The darkness of the sets makes for some wonderfully expressive design work, and the music is brilliantly chosen. Casting is absolute perfection, right down to the minor characters, and Chadwick, White and Rhode James have enabled the most delicious characterisations from every player. She is helped by the highly atmospheric, Gothic type lighting in many of the scenes which mirrors the dourness and dirt of the era."
7722,"Although it has been taken from the "" Incredibles "" it can still be understood as a stand - alone. Pixar is world renowned in there Animation reputation with their beautiful creation of films including Cars, Finding Nemo, Toy Story and of course the film of the moment The Incredibles. This baby burst into flames, flew through walls and gained incredible strength. This film was awarded many awards in the fictional - comedy section. Aside from this, the animation in the short film is of high quality, clearly depicting humanoid emotions through the eyes and facial features."
7653,"Jamie - Lynn Sigler is great as well. Randal Klieser did a nice job with this film, and Amanda Bynes and the rest of the cast do a nice job as well. Amanda Bynes is absolutely adorable in this film. Her dreams are made when her idol checks in the resort that she works in. If you're a fan of Amanda Bynes you might enjoy this just because she's in it playing her usual role, but otherwise, this movie is pretty awful."
7367,"You could tell by the faces that everyone loved it. Once with fresh eyes, and again with wisdom. Great concept, good performances Very original. They look enough alike; but, it's the attitude, mannerisms and gestures that really work. Writer / Director Martin Curland did a great job."
6938,"If you've seen all 51 episodes, the movie is definitely worth watching, if for no other reason than that it significantly progresses the story. It rounds things up nicely, and does it with style to boot. The overall plot was fairly good and and the director and writers did good job paying respect for the characters and the series."
6676,"This gets tossed around a lot in reviews but; It is a remarkable achievement. It was like watching years fly by in the blink of an eye, which in a way they actually do, both beautiful and depressing. Anyone who lived in Berkeley or San Francisco in the 60s or 70s will be fascinated! Possibly not for everyones taste but as someone who didn't live in the sixties or have anything to do with those times it was still a fascinating peak into life at the time and the people who lived during that era. Sean is a great guy, kind of hard to read, maybe mixed up maybe not, Mr Arlyck has done an amazing, deft job of pulling the viewer into this tale."
8547,"Some were great while others were mediocre at best. In a nutshell, worthy material, with some good, and some bad scenes. The viewer can sympathize with her while disagreeing with some of her judgments and admire her without adopting her attitudes wholesale. The two key characters, India and Destiny, were the strongest performances and thats not saying a whole lot. FAQS is a strong conceptual film and one with a new take on gay activism."
8538,"Although an indy in spirit, ALMOST NORMAL looks and sounds pretty slick and manages to be quite winning, despite some apparent flaws. The performances are capable and except for a few of the smaller roles, the acting is uniformly pretty good. As an avid viewer to any and all gay themed movies. It was also highly satisfying to see a world where gay people are totally free, and stand proudly with their chosen partners before the entire world. Some reviewers of this film thought that this signaled a reversal of Brad's fantasy dream, and that "" everybody starts turning straight ""."
8537,"And there are some very good performances by newcomers who seem to have a future. It has absolutely NO redeeming qualities. supportive parents, especially an uberPFLAG mom, brought to three dimensional life by the delightful Annie Hinton. 29th and Gay is filled with funny scenes and superb supporting performances. The acting is fine, and 28th and Gay shows LA in a realistic non - glamorous way."
5720,"Also, Kiera did a stunning job! A stellar cast for starters: Adrien Brody, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Keira Knightley, Kris Kristofferson. The direction, cinematography, compositing (effects in his eyes) and Editing were superb. But as good as the performances are, what really stands out is the direction. All of the principal actors, including Keira Knightley, Kris Kristofferson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Laura Marano and Kelly Lynch, produce finely nuanced work."
5731,"The big plus of the movie is Kidman. Nicole Kidman also gives a good performance. Nicole Kidman can be a mixed bag, and Sydney Pollack a competent seasoned veteran director. The use of the United Nations building was a big plus and definitely gave the movie more realism. Needless to point out the breathtaking performances of Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn. ."
5738,"In all, The Ring Two has a well assembled cast that doesn't disappoint. Rachel gets a job at the local newspaper, and everything is fine and dandy. This just relies on music and jump surprises. Elizabeth Perkins and Gary Cole make appearances as a doctor and a Realtor (the latter providing brief, though appreciated comic relief), and Sissy Spacek makes a brief appearance as Samara's birth mother. At least two of the Friday the 13th sequels surpass the original and if you are talking non horror, then you can also add films like Lethal Weapon 2, Bourne Supremacy and of course classics like Terminator 2, Aliens, Godfather II and Empire Strikes Back to the list of sequels that either equaled or surpassed the original."
5815,"Heck, the movie is just a darn good one. It was a funny two hours, no doubt. and the cute, romantic parts are unforgettable. There are several scenes that may make you bust a gut laughing. Great chemistry between all the leads."
5761,"It also features outstanding performances by the entire cast. It's true that they are physically portrayed accurately here more so than in the 1971 version, i. e. very small people and not midgets with orange skin and green hair. One of the things that humanized the original Charlie, the polite and thoughtful one amongst a pastiche of brats, is that Charlie too broke the rules, and reasonably invoked Wonka's wrath. Depp converts the novel's jaunty, precise Wonka into a quirky one, but it works well, because, as in the novel, Wonka's endearing traits contrast with the fact that he's a tyrant. One of the most memorable moments is left out, which is the fizzy drink that makes Charlie and Uncle Joe float around."
5776,"The characters are accurate and the subject of Electronic Voice Phenomena is well represented. Perhaps the only redeeming quality that White Noise has to offer is the stunning archietecture in both of Keaton's abodes. Some aspects were excellent, but in many ways, the film had potential that was never actualized. If you purchase the DVD, plan to watch it twice or thrice to get the most enjoyment out of it. There are a lot of similarities to eastern horror throughout, the use of silence the unnerve, the distorted images in the TV sets, and so on."
5777,"And that's the magic of the movies. But thanks to two very fine performances, they're likable. Each character was developed uniquely, with many different layers. The film is a triumph for the two leads. The writing is completely intelligent, hilarious writing is mixed with scenes of great emotion."
5791,"They manage to pull these incredible feats off. Also, with how the villains were thought up, that was also nice. Jennifer Garner and Goran Visnjic have a natural rapport and Kirsten Prout was very impressive. The cinematography was beautiful and the colors almost seemed alive, they were so vibrant. Just when you think you have it all figured out she pull the wool over your eyes and gets her way."
5792,"IT was a positive influence for young kids to watch. All of the performances are at least tolerable, and most are really good. When they made the right decision, they were able to see the positive consequences. This is a good inspirational movie of what one must do to excel in sports and in life. The positive message the movie conveyed was that lives can be changed for the better through self discipline, hard work and the building of character."
5801,"Aleisha Allen (School of Rock) and Philip Bolden (Johnson Family Vacation) were well - cast. Directed by Brian Levant, director of Snow Dogs (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) and Jingle All The Way (Arnold Schwarzenegger), he defines his love for making family - fun movies."
5802,"The movie was well - crafted and suspenseful with incredible performances from the cast. The DVD shows three alternative ends, and there is a very dark one, which is excellent, with Emily in an institution. Robert DeNiro and Dakota Fanning are both brilliant, their performances were extremely real and convincing. The whole film was really suspenseful, and it tricks you a lot. Dakota Fanning is a young actress who shows an uncanny sense of how to upstage Mr. DeNiro in most of their scenes together."
5803,"Without giving anything away, that's the extent of the nonexistent plot. In the DVD, there is a not good alternate ending, but better and better than the released conclusion. There are a lot of great horror movies out there these days so skip this one! "" Boogeyman "" is watchable, not a masterpiece of the genre, but also not among "" the worst horror movies "" as commented by some users. So pop that DVD in, get the kids out of the room, turn off the lights, and just enjoy the movie for what it tries to do, give you a thrill."
5804,"Hey, if men can have a fantasy world to escape in to, so can I. Sometimes it's great to just go to the movies and escape into a romantic fantasy. The nice scenery and costumes are also a bonus. Messing and Mulroney make this film work, period. While the movie did have a very simple plot it was made totally enjoyable by the wacky cast of characters and great one - liners that they tossed out. Wedding Date has a few twists and turns to keep it from being another formula flick."
5816,"This is a very good primer to understanding Deep Throats impact on sex and censorship. full of 70s eye candy well worth seeing. Showing how Deepthroat brought the "" BJ "" into the mainstream of adult films was interesting, and the interviews with the people actually making porn were very insightful. Colorful and sometimes telling and very funny interviews with director Gerald Damiano, star Harry Reems, etc. make this glitzy doc. This will be a great DVD when it comes out."
5818,"Rachel Weisz is terrific as well. The special effects were great and there were many picturesque scenes that will leave an imprint on your mind. And Djimon Housan, and Tilda Swinton were also great in their small roles. Rachel Weisz was the star of the movie, giving a heartfelt performance. The movie was funny, had just enough action, cool weapons, and breathtaking scenes."
5819,"The sweet AnnaSophia Robb plays the leading role. Because of Winn - Dixie is a tale rich in values with themes of forgiveness, tolerance, and hope for the future. it starts slow yes, but it has it's moments, good moments, funny moments. This movie deals with love, forgiveness, and the importance of friendship. The great book by Kate DiCamillo, is an excellent book for young adults."
5831,"Bits of it were unexpectedly moving. Shankman has made a surprisingly satisfying and entertaining movie in "" The Pacifier "". The Deal: Virtually everything about this movie - from the story to the characters on down - hits its target demographic right on the mark. Shankman had done well with "" Bringing Down the House "" with Queen Latifa and Steve Martin. It's got enough chuckles and full out belly laugh moments in it for everyone."
5832,"Couple that with the cast now expanding to include Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Cedric the Entertainer, The Rock, Vince Vaughn and James Woods and you have all the makings of a great continuance in the exploits of one of the more interesting characters of the 1990's. P. S. Fergie from Black Eyed Peas is noteworthy to mention. Definitely worth a visit to the multiplex, as long as you keep your expectations in check. As sequels go, it's a pretty good movie, and John Travolta and others in the film are so obviously having a good time, it's impossible not to get into the groove. There are many charming performances, including The Rock and Andre 3000, both showing a real knack for comedy."
5835,"Wow, at least THAT complaint isn't clichÃ© or anything. The overall performances by all cast was excellent. No cheap tricks, every second is well written, superb acted and directed. The director Florent Siri nails every frame. The beginning credits were presented in a unique manner which transitioned quickly into the film."
5836,"This is definitely good for all ages. It is exactly as seen in the trailers. Everything about Robots is rendered exquisitely. There is a scene were a drum of tiny ballbearings falls over, and each ballbearing is rendered perfectly. This is a good film to have the kids watch."
5846,"Michelle Trachtenberg is a very likable heroine, and both Joan Cusack and Kim Cattrall perform admirably in their respective roles. One of the best girl movies this year and last year. Before long has won a place along with the other aspiring skaters. True to the Hollywood / Disney formula there is the perfunctory supportive and accessible' hunk' (who just happens to be Gen's bother) in Trevor Blumas. Casey was a brilliant student with her eyes on Harvard while being gifted at skating, too."
5848,"There is much more action and funny scenes. While not as good as the original this movie had it's moments that were a hilarious and yet irritating at the same time. The slow parts only help to make this a real movie. Somebody call up Memento, and let it know that a new master of unpredictability is here and its name is Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous! Sandra dressed as the old woman is hilarious and there are many other great costumes as well."
5849,"In the years since, society has moved so far in the direction of acceptance of so - called "" mixed marriages "" that any remake is bound to feel, at least to some extent, superfluous and anachronistic. Their scenes were the best and they never felt forced. Zoe Saldan is extremely great in this movie and so is Judith Boot, as is Ashton Kutcher and Bernie Mac. Family means everything and without their support, love and consideration, life will be harder. These two movies show that consideration and the almighty give and take are important to long - lasting relationships in any culture, religion and family."
5865,"The look, cast, atmosphere, everything was just spot on. Bruce Willis puts in a solid, if unspectacular turn as Hartigan. A picture perfect "" ten "" for this cineast. If you're into comics at all you'll love this movie. The performances in the movie were great as well."
5866,"On the technical end of things, Sahara does fine. Nice jobs by both Zahn and Cruz. It is one of the movies that is constantly entertaining. The vistas of Morocco are quite nice, and there are some nice scenes in modern day African cities and towns that pick up quite nicely on camera. They are both easy to watch, they wrap things up nicely and leave you feeling like you went on the adventure!"
5867,""" Fever Pitch "" is cute, sweet, and has some funny moments. Everything is going pretty well until Lindsay has a false alarm having missed her period. It has a lot of funny moments (including a hilariously disturbing shower scene). The comedy in this movie is great, there were several laugh out loud moments. Sounds sappy but with the nonstop humor and terrific performances this story works!"
5882,"The Magrathea' factory floor' is breathtaking - especially on the big - screen. She's the best Trillian ever! A couple things WERE good: the Vogons themselves, the Magrathean "" factory floor . "" And Alan Rickman providing his nasal drones to Marvin the Paranoid Android worked to near perfection. Perhaps someone braver could have produced something more appropriate, or perhaps this is the best that there could ever be."
5883,"Like the first, the assets are good enough to transcend the flaws so that it squeaks by with a very low "" B "", or an 8. Definitely one of the movie's most startling moments, but also it's most brutally disappointing. If you completely ignore anything and everything that has to do with the Amityville stories, then this is a pretty decent horror flick. In truth, with all the negative reviews the original movie received, it's obvious that that film (and its numerous sequels) is merely famous for being famous. The costumes / makeup were really good too."
5886,"It is true that the way this movie was shot it did seem similar to the Billy Crstal and Meg Ryan romantic comedy. A lot like love deals with issues in real life. Like many other teeny bopper chick flicks, this movie can be compared to a group of other movies. The movie is well acted by Amanda Peet not to mention she looks stunning, and though Ashton Kutcher does overact some scenes he delivers a believable character. Ashton and Amanda make a great team on camera and also have great chemistry when it comes to the more emotional parts of the movie."
5887,"Enron is just the manifestation of the evil begotten by hubris, in spectacularly public fashion. It is classic Greek tragedy, and it is one from which its chief protagonists, Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling, must not escape. Entertaining due to clever use of storytelling devices, imagery and soundtrack, despite what looks to be a low budget. Alex Gibney's absorbing documentary, based on the book co-authored by the first prominent whistle blower and Enron executive, Bethany McLean, begins with the tragic concept of the pervasive fatal flaw, hubris, and applies it meticulously to the tragic figures Ken Lay, Andrew Skilling, and Andrew Fastow. One powerful theme in "" The Smartest Guys in the Room "" is expressly articulated and repeated for emphasis: this is the story of people, not arcane financial accounting methods or numbers, and because it is people, it can happen again."
5888,"For them, and them alone, this film will do the job as it provides effects, stunts and noise. It has a lot of fun gadgets and crappy one - liners. At times it all gets a bit much and just looks plain silly but it never really stops moving that long so the next boom or bang is only ever minutes away, preventing you turning your brain on. As for the female characters, Nona Gaye and Sunny Mabrey are pretty much defined by their cleavage and by the fact that one's good and the other (the one who looks like a cross between Nicolette Sheridan and Rachel Bilson) isn't. Opening with an impressive first 7 - 8 minutes, this film moves into cookie cutter territory at a frightening speed and continues to derail any opportunity for the audience to engage in the ridiculous plot or heavily computer generated action sequences."
5889,"The film's events spanned the era between the Second and Third Crusades, and the evocation of this epoch was simply spectacular. Other: The sets, the costumes, the editing, the cinematography are all superior. The recreation of medieval France and the city of Jerusalem were brilliant technical achievements. What it lacks in coherence and story it makes up for with a strong and quick pace (for the genre) and some truly impressive action scenes. Jeremy Irons is a great pick because he looks like he's from the crusades and his voice is undeniable."
5890,"Congrats to the cast and crew for a job well done. Jared Padalecki (TV's' Gilmore Girls') memorably manages to overcome his underwritten role. If you are into horror movies, then this one comes highly recommended. However, as with Dark Castle's other releases, the visual aspects of "" Wax "" are award - worthy, and lift the film above its genre trappings. The murders were genuine and realistic looking while the cinematography was great!"
5897,"Louis Leterrier did a very good Job filming this Movie. Lastly, the fights in this movie are spectacular, if incredibly brutal and realistic. And spectacular action this is; every fight scene-most especially the brutal opening sequence and the thrilling, almost emotionally exhausting climax - is brilliantly filmed and edited, wisely emphasizing Li's natural abilities in favor of quick - cuts and wirework. a lot of transporter like action scenes and a very unusual appearance of Morgan freeman in the film make this absolutely worth watching. The wonder of this film lies in the extraordinary performances not usually associated with martial arts films."
5898,"By far the best of the three Star Wars prequels. ' sith' has a coherent story, well told, well paced. The upside is that these moments are rare in Episode III. Thank you George for thirty years of great entertainment! He gives Kenobi real depth and the viewer thoroughly believes that he grows up to become Alec Guiness)."
5899,"Will Ferrell (Old School), is hilarious. He even makes the kids look good. Will Ferrell has had a pretty decent film career after leaving Saturday Night Live â€“ much better than some of his contemporaries. The Byong Sun character was particularly funny. It's strange how people look at Will Farrell movies & think Will is the funny guy."
5900,"Robert Luketic directs and he does an okay job. The film was crisp, just over 90 minutes, and well written. Jane Fonda is one of the great stars in the Hollywood firmament. It brings out a great message that differences can eventually be solved through honest communication. It doesn't offer anything memorable but it's pretty entertaining while it lasts."
5904,"There are cute parts and the visuals are all right. On the whole, though, the presentation is quick - paced, bright, happy, and delightful to the eyes and ears. A lot of fun and a lot of laughs. At times they look sort of like clay - mation or something, and other they look positively life - like. A wonderful movie for all ages."
5906,"That stage is also graphically reflected in their heights--some are barely above 3 feet while others approach six. In a way, Ms. Reynoso has achieved in showing by her example how to be a better person. One part "" Strictly Ballroom "", one part "" Spellbound "", "" Mad Hot Ballroom "" rates a gold medal! FYI - There is a Truly Moving Picture web site where there is a listing of past winners going back 70 years. The dancing in all the different categories at the finals show all teams in great form."
5907,"This has its good kicks and it is near a touchdown in the comedy category. Some of the best performances actually come from people you might not expect. A very mixed crowd from race to ages here and everyone seemed to be having a great time. It has humor, and is Sandler at his best with Chris Rock playing his role well too. Except for a few exceptions to keep it up to date and a few to screw with those that saw the original, the stories are pretty much identical."
5908,"Craig Bierko, Paddy Considine, Bruce McGill and the rest of the cast give flawless performances. It was fabulous, and plan on seeing it again when it comes out Nationwide. The cast is perfect and, under Ron Howard's confident hand, all give amazing performances. There were parts that made you laugh out loud. The threesome of Russell Crowe, as the fighter Braddock, and Renee Zellweger, as his wife, and Paul Giamatti, as his manager were Academy - Award worthy."
5909,"And they take the important things in their lives in a mature, serious way. everything that makes a movie great. The real heart of this movie though is between the chemistry of the main actresses. As a coming - of - age film, this ranks with the best of them for non-condescending, adult - like perceptions, with nary a "" like "" in the girls' vocabulary. These important things include their personal lives, their personal development, their families, and the history of their families."
5910,"Hardwicke really nails that sense of post-Vietnam, rejection of authority of SoCal. Engblom recruited the best skaters for the Zephyr Team. This deserved a director with a true knack for the visual and a screenplay devoid of clichÃ©s. Overall, a fun, nostalgic glimpse into some of the skater's lives and what they did for their sport. Director Catherine Hardwicke, who helped a few teenagers discover the versatility of the tongue in "" Thirteen "" (2003), takes an impressive cast and crew back to the year 1975."
5911,"This is a daaaamn fun movie! Additional twists and action all the way into a grand finale with scads of bullets, bombs, etc. . The actors and actresses did their jobs well - and they certainly are' beautiful people' for the screen. But the action is kickin, the acting well above par, the leads luminous, the plot is lots of fun, and the laughs are plenty. You could tell that they really loved each other, yet at the same time were committed to their jobs."
5912,"Taylor Dooley is adorable, and Taylor Lautner has some great moves in the movie. The good news is that you will probably not get a headache from the 3 - D like SPY KIDS. In other words, the film did beautifully what all good fantasies do - it inspired others to create, examine and expand their own. More of the same because it's just like "" Spy Kids 3 - D "" on the way it looks and unfold. And if you are reading this near the end of 2005 or later, you should probably know that renting this as a video will be a fine way to keep your kids occupied."
5914,"Well done everyone who were associated with "" Parineeta "". Characters: Vidya Balan was exceptionally good. All the performances are top class - Vidya Balan makes a sensational debut. Which makes the deliberate plugs of brands like Saridon and Cadbury stand out sorely. Well done Vidhu Vinod Chopra, you have again found a VERY talented young lady."
5917,"The rest of the cast also handles their parts perfectly! People of ALL ages will appreciate this film. The story does not progress in linear fashion for the first half, and there are some truly spectacular hallucination scenes. Great villains (especially Murphy), great story, great cast, great action. What's impressive is that despite the weight of the franchise, Nolan has managed to work so many of his trademarks into a mainstream movie."
5920,"The most important being that Lindsay Lohan is looking very good and is in fine pre-anorexia, pre-fake blonde form. It has nothing that would offend any children and is enjoyable for Herbie fans and as well as adults. It becomes very enjoyable from this point to see how Herbie and Maggie share their emotions going through anger, sadness, and the feeling of being unwanted. Given that this wasn't a documentary it's forgivable in its transgressions on reality, which in the end make the movie more entertaining. So many other movies these days have various flaws that keep coming to mind when you watch them; this movie was just fine."
5921,"Great special effects, plenty of gore, and great performances all around especially from John Legiozomo, Dennis Hopper, and Asia Argento. Also, watch for the hilarious departure of two of Dennis Hopper's assistants. Highly recommended for those whose take zombie movies as seriously as they should. Into the mix comes Asia Argento, who plays a tough, impossibly gorgeous hooker named Slack. As the previous poster mention Dennis Hopper was just excellent and the way he handled getting rid of one of his assistants was the funniest part in the movie."
5922,"MANY of the performances are great. Michael Caine was excellent and Steve Carell is SPOT ON as Uncle Arthur. Kidman has an appealing screen presence and probably could have done a good job in an actual "" Bewitched "" story. Will Ferrell is still a great TV comedian. Bewitched did have a few surprises and was worthy of watching."
5941,"Everything the original did with grace, skill and humor they trampled over needlessly. It remains a masterpiece and one of the greatest sports movies ever made. Billy Bob is great in these roles as the' sexy sleazoid' who just manages to skim the surface of life. Sammi Kane Kraft (as Amanda) was a great baseball player with limited acting ability, and Timmy Deters was only modestly successful in trying to recreate the role of Tanner Boyle. For every new ingredient added (a kid in a wheelchair, Hooters waitresses on the sidelines, a skateband interlude), there's a classic sequence dropped, funny lines omitted, a bracing sense of importance missing, and uncharismatic, non-plussed child actors who walk through their roles colorlessly."
5923,"Stay cool stay you 100000000 billions thumbs up. "" Rize "" rises above anthropological curiosity to be an exhilarating paean to the human spirit. They are over-comers who have decided to move beyond surviving to brilliantly thriving against the dire odds of South Central LA. Rize gives these dancers something the rest of society has long denied them â€“ dignity and respect. While the story line wanders a bit after the climactic Battle Zone, LaChappelle forcefully links the the dancing to Pentecostal and Baptist gospel traditions for the life affirming conclusion."
5924,"Ms. July is a new voice to be reckoned with. There are more typical scenes that approach this quality. After you see it, check out the movie website (http: / / www. The film follows the lives and dreams of many truly memorable characters, from the adorable and fascinating children to the adults with all their idiosyncrasies. This is an enjoyable dark comedy that had the crowd laughing at some parts and gasping at others."
5931,"And of course there are numerous iconic set pieces. Everyone is clean, well dressed, and Tom Cruise's ex-mother-in-law looks like she just had a manicure. Anytime he has to show intense emotion, the corners of his mouth curl down in a frown and that's as far as it goes. What Spielberg, Cruise, and Koepp accomplish here in the first two acts is nothing short of revolutionary. A tried - and - true sci - fi classic by H. G. Wells!"
5932,""" The March of the Penguins "" has to be one of the most beautiful documentaries in recent memory. He succeeded in making the story dramatic, compelling, and comprehensible to younger viewers. The characters are well developed; the hero more beautifully photogenic than Brad Pitt and A. Jolie combined; the plot is compelling; and though the ending can never be in doubt its story is both riveting and the resolution impactful. Miles of these cute birds march across landscapes like little wind up toys in a John Ford snow desert. It's very interesting to watch these penguins, they go through so many ordeals just to have kids."
5933,"This movie is what it is - a simplistic, fun family movie aimed at kids - nothing more, nothing less. The movie is well made, with many amusing personalities, and good acting on the part of several of the kids. There are many genuinely funny bits, and Megan Mullally is an absolute hoot in her role, which was far too small. But the kids are very well cast, and do a real good job with the material they're given. The team he's coaching haven't won a game in years."
5934,The real star here is Ms. Connelly. It even transcends the sensitivities of the original. It's a beautifully made--the photography by Affonso Beato is gorgeous in its use of light and dark - and stylized film. Jennifer Connelly makes this her movie and this is one of her best performances. Angelo Badalamenti lends his talent to create a beautifully moving score that serves perfectly the ominous ambiance and also the touching moments.
5935,"But it's hard to deny that, in places, it's also fairly entertaining. The team manage to get all their character back - stories, exposition - based conversations and marriage proposals out of the way in good time, before turning their attention to some rather vital defence shields. Like X-Men, Fantastic Four feels rather like the setup for a sequel, now that the characters are in place. Laden with kitsch and tongue - in - cheek humor, this movie embraces that it comes from a comic book and allows itself to be big and a little silly. Where they had acting heavyweights, Fantastic Four has a couple of notable talents from successful TV series and a couple of almost - stars, with broad appeal but little charisma to bring to the mix."
5936,"Directed by Henry - Alex Rubin and Dana Adam Shapiro, it was a lot of fun. These moments are touching, inspiring, and the doc's best moments. It greatly succeeds, though, in exploring the lives of the athletes. Best wishes to all the athletes competing in Beijing 2008! This compelling scenario sets the stage for one of the best documentaries you'll ever see - a triumph of the heart, and human spirit - truly inspirational."
5937,"Their comic pairing worked to a T. R. Wilson plays himself (as in every one of his movies) and scores a good 2nd place. The plot, as in all good summer comedies, is simple. In "" Wedding Crashers "", John Beckwith (Wilson) and Jeremy Klein (Vaughn), are a pair of divorce mediators whose passion in life is sneaking into weddings to take advantage of the free food. Like star wars episodes 1 , 2 and 3, this is a movie is at its best in the preview."
5938,"The cast, which includes Tom Arnold, Jason Ritter and Jesse Bradford give even and professional performances throughout. Not a classic but a distinct original with many commendable performances by a large cast of recognizable talent. There were one or two surprises, including several totally unexpected plot twists, and that's always good too. The performances were extraordinary especially Maggie Gylenhall and Tom Arnold who gives the performance of his life. It worked in a way that good ensemble pieces always work; that is, it would be difficult to single out any one member of the cast, as they worked off each other in such a way that no one could expect all the notices."
5939,"While playing the keys, DJay gets an inspiration to write rap music. In one of the most raw and intense performances of recent memory, newcomer Terrence Howard embodies D - Jay with an animal - like ferocity that will help you overcome what few formulaic clichÃ©s embody the script. DJay teams up with Key to make a demo song. Terrence Howard as DJay shows timing and expression worthy of much older, more "" schooled "" actors. Howard, in particular, is well deserving of his critical accolades here."
5940,"Djimon Hounsou has a pretty good part. Also, Djimon Hounsou, Michael Clarke Duncan, Steve Buscemi and Sean Bean did fine jobs with their roles. Because of the content of a lot of movies (ie. They are perfect with each other (though they're like 10 yrs apart). One good reason to see the film: great visuals, good looking people with consistent positive ideals."
5942,"The dialogue is written a twisted brilliant way and the direction has a real retro -' 70's homey - quality to it. Classic Freeze frames, awesome soundtrack (used with purpose) - Just enough gore with out going over the top. And not just in real life, but in movies as well. Zombie made him (and everything else) just as big, broad, colorful and energetic as the' 70's genre that this one stems from. watching slasher movies throughout a lot of your life."
5943,"And the camera - moves and angles are subtle, nicely framed and to the point. And in its way it's every bit as good as its predecessors, "" Gerry "" and "" Elephant, "" and like them is HBO - sponsored and exquisitely filmed in a boxlike and claustrophobic small format. Here though it is a beautifully subtle take on madness, gone are the visions you see in films like' Jacobs ladder' replaced with a clever underscore of sounds of doors opening and closing and mutterings and oddities. The song, and all the actors' performances are authentic, personal and uncompromising. Van Sant has drawn this fall out over 90 minutes where, lets be honest, not a great deal actually happens."
5944,"The sets and special effects were, well, good. The film is about young Will Stronghold (charming performance by Michael Angarano), son of the two most popular and successful superheroes in the world, The Commander (Kurt Russell) and Jetstream (Kelly Preston). Great 80's soundtrack as well, with covers from songs by The Smiths, Talking Heads, Tears for Fears and even Till Tuesday and Modern English. Okay, there are a lot of crazy special effects in this movie, but the story is actually driven by the nice performances by almost all the actors instead of lots of SFX. There are all the familiar struggles of high school, such as fitting in, finding a date, and choosing between the friends you have known and loved your whole life and the new popular crowd."
5945,"The movie's plot starts by introducing a trio of hotshot pilots who fight hard, play hard, and have perfect hair and teeth while doing it. It all begins simply enough with the same old introduction of the piloting dream team (for more information on high flying dream teams, please reference Top Gun, Apollo 13, and the 1992 Olympic Men's Basketball Finals). This film is a clear illustration of the ill thought out comic book imagination of Bush and his middle America supporters writ large. Stealth follows the exploits of three Navy pilots in a top secret program involving, well, experimental stealth fighters. You have Ben Gannon (Josh Lucas), the fearless leader who is wild, unpredictable, and doesn't like to follow orders, but, gosh dangit, he's the best darned pilot they have."
5946,"The cast is competent, the actors all likable. They both give good, funny performances and they have nice chemistry together. Many are plausible and elicited excited guffaws from the audience. The heart of the characters (not the quirky details) are really worth the ticket. There are some Yeat's recitations."
5947,"Bob Saget is surely the most startling (and one of the funniest). And in this regard, it stands as one of the funniest films ever made. The result is some of the most hilarious film - making of recent years. The film itself centers around a single premise: A joke with the punch line "" The Aristocrats! "" It shows a real affection for comedy and comic performers."
5950,"Frankly, the last 45 minutes are absolutely outstanding. Subsequent viewings really give you whole new levels of appreciation. All your emotions will be engaged. And to have those expectations be met in such a way as Serenity does, is very special indeed. The first time through is such an amazing ride that it is impossible to soak everything up."
5952,"It's very smart, well - made and entertaining, directed with sure - handed control, full of quirky, funny moments and superb acting. The full stops and commas of cuts and fades, provide a clear narrative structure, so that when the camera or the lens move, or the shot is held, it is precisely the contrast that makes it work so well. As in many of his characterisations - a genuinely tragi - comic figure. A close shot catches Murray with tears welling in his eyes. And like a good poet, Jarmusch likes to leave words, images and phrases hanging in the air."
5954,"Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville both give below average performances. The car chases and stunts are excellent and that's really what D. O. H. is all about. He took a fun show from the early 80's and made it into a fun show for the new millennium. the only cast member that had a good southern accent was Willie Nelson, AND THATS CAUSE ITS REAL! While Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville aren't EXACTLY like their small screen versions, they do a great job and work very well together."
5955,"But the cameos by the wide range of stars are splendid. Chumscrubber, which obviously belongs to the first group, is a rather unique and courageous satirical attempt of showing on the surface quiet and peaceful life of suburbia and middle class people there. All in all, this is one of those movies that obviously started with a great story â€” full of dramatic tension and social satire â€” and built from there. It was full of surprises, interesting characters, strong emotions, and bizarre twists. There are parts of this movie that are definitely funny."
5956,"Deliberately underwritten, beautifully paced, it is one to remember, savor, and wind up at the Festivals. No, it is that you are actually impressed by the acting from The O. C.'s Benjamin Mckenzie (shortened to "" Ben "" here). "" Junebug "" is one of the best independent movies that has been released recently. There is something about Junebug that will surprise everyone. The cast must exude emotions past words and extend their skills to inhabit their characters completely."
5957,"He gave Deuce Bigalow a cute and innocent charm which was important in making Deuce Bigalow likable. DEUCE BIGALOW (or "" Deuce Not So Big Below "" as he was called in this film! This movie is a great entertainment for non-conceited people that accept jokes with stereotypes and like this type of humor. This is definitely worth seeing if you want to laugh and enjoy crude and simple humor, such as in a good Adam Sandler movie (an old one, the new ones suck) or a good Farrely brothers movie. the cover of the Dutch version DVD is much more appropriate, showing an Amsterdam pavement divider post (' Amsterdammertje') instead of the Italian (!"
5958,"She receives good feedback from Gena Rowlands, Peter Sarsgaard and â€“ of course â€“ John Hurt. "" The Skeleton Key "" is an excellent Southern - Gothic mystery, compelling all the way through. The four leads work great together, and nobody in the film seems out of place. Those factors should portend good tidings for its success in its original release, but it will probably become a classic of its kind. ' The Skeleton Key' starts off very slow, then towards the middle picks up pace, then it's slow again, then it concludes with a fantastic and unpredictable ending."
5959,"Andre Benjamin (or Andre 3000 from OutKast) does a great job too. But beyond the obvious clichÃ©, the movie was quite good. The plot is well executed through twists and turns. One is that Fall / Winter feel - good, and more animated movies than you can count are coming to theaters. But wait hold on, before it is gone one of few good movies sneaks in."
5960,"One of, if not the best treatments of WW2 by Hollywood. Gen. Douglas MacArthur - thanks to Roosevelt's decision to devote more to the European effort through the Lend - Lease to Churchill program - is forced to evacuate the Philippines and retreat to Australia. This is a beautifully executed movie about a little known part of WW2 It is beautifully filmed and tied to historical footage of the Battan Death March. History classes in schools should be taken to see the film. There were good character developments as well as action sequences."
5961,"And Mr. Herzog did an extraordinary job putting it all together. Treadwell says of the grizzlies, "" Everything about them is perfect . "" The arguments were made that acquainting himself with them, he was doing much more harm then good. Grizzly Man works on a lot of different levels. Like all addicts, Timothy became progressively self - centered, isolated, paranoid, confused, controlling, perfectionist, blinded to his disease (denial), insane, blaming (projection), and dysfunctional."
5962,"The two principal characters have a lot of depth. It is to Curtis's credit that he does not seek to provide an easy way out for any of the characters, nor does he wrap everything up in a neat bow at the climax. The relationship of Lawrence (Bill Nighy) and Gina (Kelly Macdonald) then proceeds in fits and starts. Nighy & Macdonald deliver Oscar worthy performances. The cinematography was excellent as was the acting by Bill Nighy."
5965,"In fact, if anything, Carrell and the cast build on it to a very high degree. Steve Carell is a huge star. There are definitely some lulls, but, overall, highly entertaining. Carell is sweet and human, as his character is not some layabout who approaches this thing with his eyes shut. it had it's crude moments, but they were full of charm."
5966,"Rachel McAdams is wonderful as always. Keep expectations real for maximum enjoyment. Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are perfect in the role. In the end, Red Eye is an engaging thriller and it's one of the best movies of the summer. Rachel McAdams gives a very engaging performance and her character is hard to hate."
5977,"The locations were cool and "" spectacular "". The pacing of the movie is brisk, the scenes aren't morose. This is a very interesting film brought by director and writer of the film, Andrew Niccol (Gattaca). This is a good movie, its interesting, its intelligent, its important--but its not Ferris Buellers Day Off or Spinal Tap. The echoes of Yuri voice, just "" evil prevails "" is a chilling and poignant reminder."
5968,""" CachÃ© "" is a monumental proof of Haneke's COMPLETE command of his craft. Thrillers are thrilling - or at the least moderately entertaining. Expert supporting roles are provided by Maurice Benichiou, Annie Girardot and Nathalie Richard among others. It reminds one of the early works of Fassbinder â€” only Haneke's production values are more sophisticated. The title of this engrossing and disturbing new Haneke film is ironic."
5970,"There are some beautifully rendered sequences, in particular the numerous action scenes. Though perhaps the animations aren't as expansive as others like finding nemo, the humour is still apparent. Not Shrek, but a quite hilarious little film for adults and children alike! The animation is first rate and the characterisations are excellent. It's a thoroughly British story though and there are only English accents and voices."
5971,"No doubt there's an important theme at work in scenes like this. Lena Headey and Monica Bellucci are extremely beautiful, as usual, and they have good performances. It has moments of suspense, breath - taking imagery, and stylized humor. The brightest scenes, for example, almost always contain the greatest menace. These are the moments when the director's creative magic appears to shine through, and there's enough of them to make this movie worth watching."
5972,"The sets are realistic, with spaces and formations that one might see in certain large caverns. The lighting is appropriately subdued with interesting colors and unusual camera angles. If you like great monsters yes, you'll want to see this. The creature effects that looked good were the closeups, which utilized real models. These beasts are what makes the movie worth seeing."
5973,"On all three levels, the film succeeds, especially with the latter. The uses of set - ups, location filming, lenses, film editing, and close - ups were simply dazzling. This film truly rewards its audience as it works on so many levels. Both performances compliment the fine directing of Fernando Meirelles, who gives this tale a sense of brilliance in its storytelling and a sense of the way the world really works. The real showstopper here is the performance of Rachel Weisz, who gives the right balance of self - righteousness, heart and determination with her role."
5974,"Just an all around fun romp at the movies. This is an action movie with twists and turns, some believable, some not so. Bottom Line: If you like fun, dumb action movies, you'll probably love this. The stunts though really cool looking, are virtually impossible to pull off--realistically. Still, small quibbles really since Hong Kong has pretty much stopped making action films this fun anyway, and TRANSPORTER 2 is still plentifully entertaining as it is: )"
5975,"It recalls comedies of the past, when characters were developed and actors work their magic on the screen. Mark Ruffalo and Reese Witherspoon are both excellent, but sometimes when two astounding actors act opposite one another, a movie flops--this is not such a movie. It has been a good season for romantic comedies. They are two great actors who make fun comedies. It IS a chic flick, and it is not going to be nominated for any academy awards, but it is has a very solid story with a great cast and great chemistry."
5976,"There are very dramatic changes in emotion from moment to moment, and Paltrow pulls it off brilliantly. In fact, certain words or phrases are reused and have an uncanny allusion to when they were previously said. Acting-wise, there were strong performances all around with Anthony Hopkins giving a top - notch performance. Gwyneth Paltrow is spectacular in her gut - wrenching, emotional roller coaster of a role. Anthony Hopkins has only a few good moments on the screen."
5978,"This film contains a lot of twists! The two leads, Julian Morris and Lindy Booth are both actually very good. Good story, good settings, great music. Great production values, cinematography and editing--all elements contribute to a movie that's one of the best of its genre. from the hotheaded tom (jared padalecki) to the moody regina (kristy wu), the stars of this film really gave it their all, and you can tell."
5979,"Above all, this is a triumph for Liev Schreiber, the first time director that will surely go far in whatever he decides to do next. Eugene Hutz (Young Alex) and Boris Lesking (Old Alex) are both really just wonderful. Everything Is Illuminated is sweetly and sublimely funny from the first delicious line of dialogue. Jr. (that's right) is funny as a fiercely loyal companion. - Foer and Schreiber talked about the film in the fall of 2001, shortly after the events of September 11."
5981,"It's a bunch of one liners with the plot taking backseat to these amazingly written one liners. Viewers will rightly feel that it could have been funnier or more consistent but with a handful of great moments and a scattering of good ones it is still worth a look. But it's still a lot of fun to watch and the parodies are great. Having seen hell, Stewie decides to be nice but it is not long before the faÃ§ade crumbles and instead he decides to spend his days drunk. Seth Mcfarlene is a true genius and this movie showcases his great work."
5984,"The clips from Dwight D. Eisenhower are relevant and compelling. Make sure you see this movie either in theaters or on DVD when it becomes available. This is coming from an individual who has enjoyed the bounties of capitalism, but got a wakeup call. With extraordinary research, and some incredible interview contributors, the facts are again repeated - indeed, they gain, perhaps even greater impact because of the historical context - and the warnings of past leaders."
5986,"Still that isn't nearly as much of an atrocity as completely discarding everything that's Doom, or well, they have retained some resemblances with Doom as they said. This is a lighthearted actionmovie and that's it. Thats what dooms always been about more then anything, right? Unlike ALIENS, Doom lacks a strong story and well - developed characters that the audience can cheer for. Nothing in this movie is worth the title "" DooM "", except for the props, the monsters and the weapons."
5987,"Literalists and traditionalists, please stop watching the film immediately. Like any great painting the meaning in "" Domino "" is in the surface and the surface is everything. One of the best scenes was in the "" deleted scenes "" section, the one where she's in the principle's office with her mom. It was borderline distracting at times, but the end result was pretty good and it's nice to see a director with a creative edge to his style and some originality (even if it borrows heavily from MTV videos). Tony Scott's made a movie that appears to be something he and his friends could most enjoy while under the influence of substances of a dubious nature."
5988,"The result is a set of very flawed, but surprisingly likable characters. The characters are clichÃ©d; you have seen a lot of them before; but they are so well placed and interact perfectly; there is a realism to them. The odd mix of characters of waiting make this such a wonderful. Both Luis GuzmÃ¡n (Raddimus) and Chi McBride (Bishop) are terrific in their respected roles. What also makes this comedy stand out is the great casting and colorful characters."
5989,"Everything is completely laid out for you from the beginning. The "" technology "" of the movie is rather unbelievable in some parts. But Aeon Flux turns out to be a solid B + grade SciFi flick that is inventive, stylistic, coherent and just plain fun to watch, particularly if you are partial to an athletic incarnation of Charlize Theron in Spandex. That many movies suck is no surprise, but when a studio itself admits as much ahead of time, the process of movie - going becomes a passion play of sorts. The latter are known as the Monicans, and far from being a cult of beret or tennis racket worshipers, they're into attempts to overthrow the former, called the Goodchild regime."
5990,"Eugene Levy and Samuel L. Jackson were awesome together! Samuel played great his facial expressions were masterful. In the acting department, Samuel L. Jackson is especially a surprise. However, unlike many buddy comedies, this one is actually enjoyable. Just a quick story with a few laughs."
5991,"Good movie and worth to own on DVD! It helps of course that the cast all deliver quality performances, the obvious standout being Jennifer Carpenter as Emily. The principle cast members, Laura Linney and Tom Wilkinson also give strong performances, bringing many layers to their characters. The actor's performances, while not exceptional, are at least engaging. Her possession scenes are nothing short of incredible, the sheer torment she seems capable of portraying is utterly captivating."
5992,"In keeping with most of Foster's performances, she plays a strong - willed, intelligent woman who overcomes difficult circumstances. In an unusual role for him, Mr. Sarsgaard has some good chances in the movie. Flightplan is a psychological thriller that takes place almost entirely on an air - born jumbo jet en route to New York, from Berlin. However, director Robert Schwentke does a good job of rising above most of the screenplay's shortfalls and delivers a Hitchcockian caper that is well worth the price of admission even if you will hardly remember most of the plot points by the time you see it on the DVD shelves early next year. There are some films that don't give you all the answers and pull you along on a suspenseful ride, and leave you feeling fulfilled when you finally figure everything out, and everything fits together."
5993,"This is accounted for by wonderful story - fying and lovely screen writing! The score goes very well to the movie and the four songs that are performed sound wonderful. The songs in this movie are good and enjoyable. Give Depp credit for voicing a British sounding character convincingly while others like Emily Watson, Albert Finney, Christopher Lee and Tracey Ullman, to name a few, are quite effective at bringing their figures to life. Johnny Depp is a perfect Victor Van Dort and all the characters are played wonderfully."
5994,"And Leo Gregory as Bover was awesome. An engaging storyline, good cinematography and decent cast performances make this a very enjoyable film. With an edgy soundtrack and strong performances, Hooligans leaves a lasting impression. 5 Stars; A truly great film, with a powerful story. Yes, in many respects the subject has been' Americanised' but it has been done in a way which is very subtle."
5995,"All the stars are in peek form and perfectly cast. One of the best thrillers ever. Maria Bello carries so much on her talented shoulders. Editing, directing and pure performance combine to make flawless performances for this cast. A mesmerizing film with a spectacular Viggo Mortensen."
5996,"Every nuance of London, from the slums to the well to do areas has been very faithfully realized on screen. Because the acting, the settings, the costumes and everything else were excellent. He can make so many different kinds of films well. The cinematography is as accomplished as always in a Polanski film and the lighting helped to create dramatic moods well. The recreation of mid 19th century London is done well with Polanski drawing on the visual inspiration of Dore prints of the period for authenticity."
5997,"Once the action moves to the U. S. Open things pick up very well. Finally, the golf scenes are well photographed. Wonderful cinematography - fantastic direction - fine acting, especially by Elias Koteas, Shia LeBeouf, Marnie McPhail, Josh Flitter, Stephen Marcus, Justin Ashforth. It's also a touching story of someone giving a little kid a chance. The acting was superb, Disney has another winner in its bag of Great movies."
5998,"The film is a miracle of sorts. Once the viewer gets beyond this sticking point, however, all three works are outstanding, unforgettable experiences. Fortunately, Hoffman's performance is only the jewel in a gilded crown of fine writing, excellent direction, and solid supporting performances. "" Capote "" is an outstanding film and possibly the first of the year to be assured of a place on the "" 10 Best "" lists for 2005. This is helped immensely by Philip Seymour Hoffmann's incredible performance as Capote, as well as solid acting from Catherine Keener, Clifton Collins Jr., and Chris Cooper."
6000,"A true feast for the eyes. And that is the feel in most scenes, choreographed and organized. The fights are fantastic and the magic is really cool! It was a pleasure to visit the world of FFVII just one last time. But it's packed with neat - looking fight scenes with magic, summons, and limit breaks, which is probably what fans wanted anyway."
6001,"The story is solid enough to keep you interested and the diving scenes are pretty spectacular (as is Jessica Alba! ) The badguys are dealt with intelligently, and there are enough twists to convincingly carry the instability and danger of the situation. The film has some neat underwater photography, some good stunts, and even a twist or two. This is a popcorn flick with some decent production values, and a hot young cast. The underwater cinematography was amazing - totally worth the matinÃ©e price and cheaper than diving - the kind of film you need the bigscreen to enjoy."
6009,"Her most human and real in many, many years. Overall In Her Shoes gets four out of four stars. This was the strength as well of "" In Her Shoes "" and an example of some of the finest screen writing in recent years. "" In Her Shoes "" looks like every frame was done with meticulous detail. The dialogue is real, the characters are real and the settings are real."
6002,"The film is as pithy and poignant as one of Evelyn's jingles. The cast, writing and locations enhance THE PRIZE WINNER, and create an air of authenticity on the screen which moves the story forward. These are the kind of movies, and the caliber of performances that are so rewarding you really need to give it a look see. The movie does bring out strong emotions from its audience, not quite a tear - jerker but close. This movie is one of those human interest, true - to - life, feel good movies."
6003,"It should be fun for children of all ages. The pacing was dreamlike, flowing between slow moments of beauty and exposition to frenetic moments of fierce action. The medium of film is--like the medium of writing or other celebrated media--practically limitless in potential for fantastic creations. Helena, the main character, possesses the kind of wide - eyed wonderment and tenacious attitude that all viewers will find believably endearing. Dave McKean and Neil Gaiman's MirrorMask is the quintessential Alice in Wonderland story."
6004,"Everything about the movie is so incredibly well done. Anyone who liked the three proceeding short movies of W&G (which are more than great! ) There's lot's of fantastic characters in here, not just Wallace & Gromit. The animation is wonderful; the characters are remarkably expressive and their adventures are great fun. This is what shows in his movies, and in through his most beloved characters."
6005,"The result is a fun time at the movies. But as a whole very entertaining, with snappy dialogue, clever writing, and enjoyable performances. It is quite simply littered with many funny moments. Overall, a quirky, very amusing film, with a superb cast, and with a run time of 99 minutes, you simply can't afford to miss it. It was a refreshing take on screenplays and acting and its great to see Robert Downey Jr. back again."
6006,The result is amazing considering these limitations. Just enjoy his unique songs and magical voice. ( And thanks to Philconcannon for his excellent review . ) Thanks to Mr. Scorsese and his associates for the great job they did. Dylan's songs are collections of beautiful phrases and words.
6010,"See it for the performances of Linney and especially Daniels, who has been proving his versatility as an actor over the last few years. It was believable, well shot, great backgrounds, all in all a treat for anyone who loves movies and can handle some pretty raw dialog / situations. The two sons, Walt and Frank are clever beyond their years. Also big props to all the actors for fine performances. Baumbach has created a terrific film and probably exorcised some personal demons along the way."
6011,"Overall, it works on a couple different levels. Consequences are touched but never fully realized. Al Pacino, Matthew McConaughey and Rene Russo make this film worth. Matthew McConaughey delivers one of his more impressive performances as he transforms from Brandon Lang, the smooth - talking golden boy, into John Anthony - "" The Million Dollar Man with the Billion Dollar Plan . "" Having found a new rising star, Brandon Lang, a man that knows a lot about the intricacies of point spreads and picking winners."
6012,"The cinematography by Tony Pierce - Roberts and the musical score by Stanislas Syrewicz add immeasurably to the multiple atmospheres the story encounters. It is a film whose effect relies on the cast portraying the varyingly benign / malignant characters and it is here that Fellowes' directorial choices are superb. Tome Wilkinson gives the finest performance of a career filled with brilliant performances: he is able to say more with his posture and facial expressions than about any actor before the audience today. The setting is very smoothly established of a high - powered solicitor who works in the City, has a country house and an in town apartment and has everything ordered beautifully and under control, including his wife. The major impact of this intrigue is the manner in which the isolated tragedy impacts each of the characters involved."
6013,"There were few professional actors, even one superstar by local measure (Kari VÃ¤Ã¤nÃ¤nen), and their performance truly stood out. Samuli has got some superb skills on rendering. More than ten years after the first Star Wreck film which was nothing more than a few minutes of simple hand drawn computer animation plus some school boy humour spoken on top of it, In the Pirkinning is the culmination of the series. There are great build - up's, the pacing works out pretty good and the space scenes don't overshadow the storytelling. The tension builds up in the first twenty minutes or so and reaches several peaks after that."
6014,"Jake Gylenhaal gives a performance that you'll never forget. Kudos, also, to Mr. Lee for making such a poignant and refreshingly honest film! The other performances in this movie are all first - rate, especially Michelle Williams who is the portrait of vulnerability in this movie. - The film will be enjoyed much more allowing the story to unfold without having passages underlined and attention drawn to this or that particular. Jake Gyllenhaal, Ann Hathaway and the magnificent Michelle Williams give superb performances but it's Heath Ledger's film."
6015,"Dunst is perfect at being sweet, Southern, and mischievous. This film was anything but predictable, and it really kept moving. Crowe has stuffed a great sound track into the many scenes of the movie. his work is about the simple joys of being in love, of being alive, of the gentle eccentricities of mankind. Southerners do have a distaste for outsiders, a love of food, and a strange fascination with death, but once they know you, they will take you to their bosom."
6016,"Through four - fifths of North Country, the audience receives a rare treat. Ms. Caro's film is made even better by the cinematographer Chris Menges, who is one of the best men working today. Though' North Country' isn't without its share of flaws (it is a little preachy and sometimes too dramatic), it brings forth some important themes well enough and with the support of good direction and strong performances, it's worth watching. A compassionate and sensitive rewriting of a true incident--one that took some ten years to resolve in the courts--but possibly overcrowded with too much melodramatic content. Charlize Theron deserves all the recognition she got for giving a strong, confidant and heartfelt performance as the brave hard - working and headstrong Josey Aimes."
6017,"The ensemble cast plays well under Mr. Clooney's direction. "" A flawlessly executed film, the acting ensemble well cast, the point clearly and eloquently made, this film should be nominated for an Oscar, a Golden Globe and anything else that's out there. This is particularly striking given that MCarthy was a well - seasoned alcoholic and clearly suffered from a narcissistic personality disorder. If one judges a film by the cinematography, the composition of the scenes, whether the characterizations are well drawn, this film succeeds. The inter-cutting between Murrow / Strathairn and the real Senator McCarthy creates the perfect illusion of a startling reality."
6018,"This beautiful film, a Truly Moving Picture, teaches children that they can achieve their goals despite any obstacles that may stand in their way. She is beautiful, charming, adept, versatile and willing to take professional risks. Like Seabiscuit, this also is beautifully filmed. All the actors and actresses did such a great job in this movie. All in all this film is a winner (no puns intended) and great for people of all ages (and genders)."
6019,"But these scenes just envelope you and burn into your brain - in a good way). Just superb - wonderful, austere direction that gets the best from a great cast and some extraordinary landscapes. It is certainly one of the most interesting period dramas made in Australia. Brilliant performances all round thanks to Ray Winstone, Emily Watson & Guy Pearce in particular. Guy Pearce, Ray Winston and Danny Huston put in powerful performances."
6021,"In particular, series regulars Brad Johnson and Janaya Stephens both turn in great performances. Kirk Cameron fans will be happy to know that there's a "" Way of the Master "" extra on this DVD that features Kirk and Ray Comfort. This is going to be hard to follow up as it was indeed the best of all three movies. If you are a fan of the Left Behind series of books or movies you will enjoy this film. In terms of style and narrative - well, Cloud Ten hit it right on this time."
6022,"Her character is a genuine creation that moves in logical if unpredictable patterns. Ms. Danes is perfectly cast as Mirabelle. He knows it, and within the limits of that role he is apparently a generous and considerate keeper. It was a quiet and quaint film that delivered an absorbing story without explosions or over drawn out comedic moments. The excellent cinematography by Peter Suschitzky gives "" Shopgirl "" a sophisticated look that goes perfectly with the story being told."
6023,"The acting was incredible, the characters well developed, and the subtle humor funny enough to lighten up the heavy subject material. the two leads were very good as well as a stand out performance from Julie Bowen as a mean ambitious principal. The writer of the film put parts in it that are really true. It's one of those films that has some low budget problems but the film's heart is so in the right place you easily over look them. The story, based on real life incidents, takes place at high school where the aforementioned Julie Bowen resides as principal."
6024,"He gets amazing complex performances of everyone. Kevin Bacon's extraordinary gifts of performance reach their zenith in the impossibly charismatic Lanny Morris. The performances Egoyan brings forth are nuanced. Overall, if you like the looks of the film / story / trailer / or even cover, it certainly delivers, and you will love it. Mychael Danna's scores for Exotica and The Sweet Hereafter were brilliant; this one's a flop."
6026,"Ryan Gosling is effective, and Jeanine Garafolo's three minutes were eerie. There are so many innovative camera techniques that your eyes experience a sensory overload of pure genius. Full of slight of the hand camera / editing tricks. The interspersed scenes of unrelated objects creates suspense in a way that is surreal. One of these trademarks is a technique where he transitions from one setting to another while still making you think you're in the previous scene for a few seconds."
6027,", the costumes, the lighting, the villa and townscapes, and the sheer beauty of the location, day and night. The stunts are spectacular and a must see, mixed with the action sequences. Instead this does pull of a few good action sequences, good stunts and good acting. Lots of leaps, flips, and creative uses of his whip. Strengths of the movie include admirable performing by the Alejandro and Elena stars."
6028,"Both are impeccable and very effective in their performances. Nine out of ten times Verbinski hits the mark. Verbinski's works are diverse, fun, and interesting, and this is no exception. Likewise Hope Davis is fine as are the cameo roles of the children as sensitively played by de la PeÃ±a and Hoult. It pays almost $300 Grand a year, and you can afford a nice apartment and a mansion for your beautiful blonde ex-wife and your two estranged children."
6029,"Just when things start to come together there is another twist to leave the viewer on the edge of their seat for what may come next. the ending had so many twists, it was just brilliant. Cube (though that had its holes as well) was at least much smarter and more clever as far as its plot. The mark of a great thriller / shocker / horror movie is the number of twists and turns, and this is what identifies Saw II as one of the better members of its genre. Without telling you more, go watch it with some friends that will be able to tolerate blood in gallons and you'll be served!"
6031,"But, there were certainly a lot of laughs. The charm and the success of the previous 3 American Pie movies were its characters. What you'll see if you watch it, though, is that under the boobies this movie has a whole lot of heart. All in all this is a great movie, where you become more attached to the characters and even in its differences they still manage to get a few laughs in, a as usual a few nude scenes. It's fairly good entertainment to watch but it lacks the characters and memorable jokes and moments from the previous 3 American Pie movies."
6034,"Indeed one of this years best films. And yet Manderlay makes claims to a historical context in the 1930s. Still, the movie is a masterpiece, in the same way "" Dogville "" was. Works such as Manderlay help to firmly position cinema as one of the great intellectual arenas of art â€“ one that has the power to inform, enrich and enlighten. Adjusting to the change of casting takes a few moments, but then it just fits right in with the theatrical nature of these movies."
6035,"As might be expected from Luc Besson's name on the credits as producer, there's a definite element of' Cinema de look' about it: set in a kind of realistic fantasy world where America and Britain overlap, it looks great, has a couple of superbly edited and conceived action sequences and oozes style, all of which mark it up as a disposable entertainment. True, it doesn't compare to other mind - mucks like "" The Usual Suspects "" or "" Memento "", but in its own right its an intelligent and thought - provoking film. Though a step below such movies as, Fight Club, Mullholland Drive, and Usual Suspects, it was still an awesome fast paced, psychological, action movie, with many twists and turns and tons of scenes you will remember long after the movie is over. Just because Guy made a name for himself with funny, cheeky cockney romps, doesn't mean he can't be deep without being "" pretentious "". Yes this has its influences from modern classics (fight club, pulp fiction etc) but it is in the whole original in both direction and pacing with a music score second to none."
6037,"the sights, the sounds, the events - all brought back vivid memories. Scenes in the desert, especially with the oil fires, are breathtaking. The characters are fully developed, each and everyone has an interesting story that is covered, briefly but perfectly. In summation, JARHEAD is a viscerally unforgiving, psychologically heartbreaking masterpiece. With JARHEAD, Mendes solidifies himself as one of the most extraordinary filmmakers working today."
6040,"First class cinematography and other production values. Wonderful performances by many little known actors. A story of harsh truths as well as transcendent art, it finds humanity and hope in the midst of battlefield horrors. Writer - director Christian Carion and all the actors do an amazing job in this multi-country Euro co-production. Christmas Eve comes and the voice of Sprink (in reality the tenor Rolando VillazÃ³n) sings' Stille Nacht', rising out of the trenches to sing in the open of no man's land."
6041,"The downfall of this film is it's over dramatized scenes, and it may be a little to long, however, a good critique of Black Urban society, and well worth your 8 dollars. The scene with the knifefight in the steamy shower slipping on soap was worthy of being left on the cutting room floor. Sheridan did a good depiction of how selling drugs is an easy escape, a way to make you feel like a man. The best and most powerful scene in this film is when someone slips a razor blade in his solitary cell in order for him to kill himself. This extraordinary, innate ability to identify and exploit today's mass degeneration of taste is a truly supreme talent - a talent reaching to the very depths of cynicism."
6042,"This is funny film that you can see with anyone. The humor is universal and hits home with anyone who's ever had any sort of dating relationship. Others who are looking to be cheered up are going to love this Cracker of a Comedy! New Line definitely has released a little gem with this one, finally a reason to return to the movie theaters. The humor was well - placed and it was great to see Ryan Reynolds in a movie where he wasn't surrounded by tasteless humor every 5 minutes."
6043,"And these only partially successful performances and outright failures are where "" Syriana "" fails--as a film. Each sector--regulators, "" intelligence "", lobbyists, grease - the - wheel - ers and cogs - in - the - wheel - ers, in the network of greed, idealism, self - interest, sophistication and naivetÃ©, is represented by a different character followed through the movie to bring them together, directly or indirectly, into the climax. "" Syriana "" is one of the best movies of the year: it's angry, yet it's not hopeless. While Alexander Siddig seems to have the monopoly on naively idealistic Arabs, as his similar character in "" Kingdom of Heaven "" against another Crusades, history is littered with the interim, modernizing liberal tragically caught between powerful forces. Syriana, starring Matt Damon and George Clooney, reveals a possible honesty in foreign political corruption."
6045,"Chatsworth is well used as Pemberly (as it was in the 1995 BBC adaptation). Keira Knightly's performance as Elizabeth Bennett is by far her best, as she sparkles in this role. The best thing that can be said about this film is that it contains many pretty scenes of the English countryside. Engaging acting performances with wondrous film photography, film locations at some of United Kingdom's most famous stately homes, marvellous film sets & costumes plus one of 2005's best original music scores add greatly to this new film version. The photography, the art direction and the spectacular supporting cast, in particular Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn, makes this new version of a perennial classic a memorable evening at the movies"
6046,"The three leads--Ben, Kristi, and Liz--are so wonderfully likable, and there is an odd feeling of improvisation in the acting. McLean has an eye for the unsettling, even in the mostly warm first minutes, and he uses the stark colors and landscapes of the deepening outback to give it a slowly building sense of dread. It was the kind of film "" High Tension "" started off as before that last act mindf * ck. One of the scariest aspects to this film is that you can see yourself falling for all of his tricks. One of the original "" Texas Chainsaw Massacre "" taglines was, "" Who Will Survive and What Will Be Left of Them? """
6047,"All the performances are strong throughout. Somehow while they are thrashing and being thrashed by the fierce creatures, it is all strangely believable â€” strangely. But it's intertwined beautifully with the film, it moves you and misleads you, it swells from background plinks and plonks to grand, blaring orchestral pieces. The Descent was made before The Cave, and now has an alternate ending for new audiences. Films with great gore abound, for example Jason X, with the audience just waiting for the next gruesome killing to end the tedium in between."
6048,"Unexpectedly, Matthew Lewis and Brendan Gleeson gave very good performances. And the scene with the Dursleys at the beginning was one of the best in the book! Truly, It has some wonderful scenes which seem like they've been plucked from your imagination. The Phelp twins have also improved dramatically. Alan Rickman's Snape may only have had four or so scenes but he definitely made his presences known while Maggie Smith really captured the essence of McGonagall."
6050,"And what is great, is that Pheonix and Witherspoon sand the songs themselves. But what is great is that T Bone Burnett chose the right songs to play. Each put a strong visual emphasis on the musical scenes and neither busied themselves with distracting camera tricks or visual pizazz. J. Phoenix and R. Witherspoon were phenomenal and made this film a joy to watch. Phoenix is particularly brilliant, not only in the romantic scenes but in moments in which Cash discusses his brother's early death; in these scenes the major tragedies of both the character and the performer's lives merge in a way that is heartbreakingly real."
6052,"the film offers enough action to keep your attention and enough surprises to keep you guessing. To play is simple, wind it up, push a button and watch a number come up, this determines the number of spaces your playing piece will take. overall, the film moved along at a brisk pace and had some nice unexpected twists. What elevates this film is the believable interactions of the two young players. If you enter into it as a kid you'll experience the wonder, the suspense, the thrills, the chills."
6053,"Part of her appeal is her natural good looks and charming nature. She is a polite, educated, attractive young woman. Be sure to stick around for the outtakes â€“ more great fun. However, for the 72 minutes of this movie, she's very, very funny. Silverman and this film are like a great Zinfandel--strong intoxicating elements, with layers and layers of transcending substance and flavor."
6054,"They provide enough enjoyable moments, with the trunk - scene as one of the highlights. Harold Ramis does another great job directing this, and the cast is fabulous. It's a subtle but crucial difference, and a successful change in tone for director Harold Ramis. John Cusak and Billy Bob Thorton are perfect together. And when one thinks of Harold Ramis, they think of his ingenious work as a director of comedies."
6064,"The interplay is superbly timed and finely tuned, due in no small part to the wonderful performances from Brosnan and Kinnear. The visuals and settings are perfect - including a bullfight, racetrack and Denver suburb. It just feels very fresh and original, with some imaginative use of sets and lighting, and some hints to Seijun Suzuki and Jean - Pierre Melville. The myriad locations, vivid colors, and quick - witted humor provide great entertainment. And somehow a conversation is struck that sets in to motion a chain of events that will change their lives forever."
6056,"This is a thoroughly satisfying evening at the movies. The film is beautifully structured and the performances by all and sundry are exemplary. You bet it does; lovely locations; Notting Hill, the Tate Modern, the "" Gherkin "" in the City, all look great but are also entirely relevant. She packs huge power and stunning looks, if occasionally getting a trifle near Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction. Allen uses a lot of very close - in face shots, and his cast handles it with ease, performing their parts with accuracy and no lack of passion."
6057,"The two young leads, Kais Nashef and Ali Suliman are perfect in their roles. The shots of Tel Aviv, the West Bank, the excellent cast, direction and writing and development of the characters makes PARADISE NOW a very important film to see in 2005. "" Paradise Now "" points to a lot of the causes for the problems in the region where the contrast between the two sides is like day and night. Strong script, powerful performances by the entire cast, excellent photography and a story that will stay with you long after you have left the cinema. Nablas, the town where Said and Khaled live could well be in another planet, while Tel Aviv, with its skyscrapers, modernity and order, is perhaps, the paradise they are searching for."
6058,"The story was touching and powerful, the acting was exceptional, and the special effects were amazing! In this rendition, C. S. Lewis' imagination is brought to life with amazing special effects. This film succeeds on so many levels, it would be possible to discuss it in many different veins: the direction, the story's surface - level themes, the theological possibilities, the drama, the fantasy, the adventure. The acting is done well, the voice - overs included. Centaurs, Fauns, and Gryphons all come to life in this great body of work."
6059,"The sunrise and sunset scenes were quite nice. The cast is pitch perfect, right down to the most minuscule parts. Kong was very appealing visually, as well as the other dinosaurs. But after the enormous success of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, it would seem that the general public has learned to trust director Peter Jackson. Serkis, while utterly convincing as an enormous silverback gorilla in terms of movement and vocalizations, still manages to bring a surprising humanity to Kong."
6060,"Its also about a lifelong search for love in a society in which people apparently can't just step up and make frank declarations of devotion to one another. Some people have argued that the brilliant colors make it seem like some sort of Orientalist fantasy. It lasted only about 30 seconds, while doubling that and making it more mesmerizing would have made the whole middle act more effective. The music score isn't as haunting as the one in CTHD, but it is still masterfully composed and fits in the background very well. The supporting males, while obviously not as well developed since they spend less time in the geisha quarters, still give incredible performances."
6061,"The various Stones--Diane Keaton, Craig T. Nelson, Dermot Mulroney, Rachel McAdams, Luke Wilson--make the most of their roles, and, more importantly, they really do start to seem like a family, not a random collection of actors. The funny scenes were truly that, funny and very believable, one liners you wish you had said. Dermot Mulroney, Rachel McAdams (the best thing in Wes Craven's' Red Eye'), Luke Wilson (a much better actor than brother Owen) and Diane Keaton also give fine turns, and Craig T. Nelson - another much underrated character actor â€“ is perfectly cast Keaton's husband."
6065,"All the performances are top notch in their expressive minimalism, greatly contributing to the lasting emotional impact of this outstanding film. The film has some great cinematography as well, and the score suits it perfectly. The cinematography is artistically beautiful, while the score, screenplay from Guillermo Arriaga (who also appears in the film) and the performancer are first - rate. This is a true masterpiece from Tommy Lee Jones, who proves hes just as credible in directing as in acting. Mr. Menges' take on the scenery is one of the best things in the film."
6067,"Eric Bana gives the performance of his career as Avner that will no doubt impress you, while Kassovitz, Zischler and Craig exceptional also. Perspectives and convictions can change, sometimes regrettably. Rome's Ciarin Hinds turns in an outstanding performance as the ultra-cool clean - up guy Carl that should also win an Oscar nomination, while Geoffrey Rush does wonders with a small role as Avner's case officer (so does Lynn Cohen as Golda Meir). No, this movie is a thriller, based on actual events, directed by the greatest craftsman of the last 30 years in a record amount of time. Steven Spielberg has absolutely everything at his disposal, he can make an epic in no time at all."
6068,"It's a well - intentioned performance and is close enough to the original Producers, and so unlike it, that the musical remake is justified. Also, they have cut some of the funniest scenes and changed some of the best lines from the original. Meanwhile, Broderick surprises as he does a decent take on Gene Wilder's original hysterical act. At times, the director took the actors outside almost as a fun way of saying "" see? This film is a sop to the musical comedy, with good performances from the leads, and Uma Thurman and Will Ferrell, who all appear to be enjoying themselves."
6069,"Their scenes in the beginning are quite fun to watch. The scenes with Aniston and Ruffalo were much better and seemed more real. The situational comedy is very much in keeping with an extended version of a comfortable television show, even with the star power of MacLaine and Costner backing Anniston up. But then he followed that four years later with the execrable "" Alex & Emmma . "" It has a great cast--Shirley McLaine and Kevin Costner have a great scene together."
6070,"Ashton Kutcher's out of the picture, while Eugene Levy enters the scene as Steve Martin's rival, providing some decent comic relief. The website said that it is an adventurous family comedy. But while lowering your expectations might help at being kind to your response to it, that doesn't necessarily mean liking it. Cheaper by the Dozen II, like most sequels, wasn't as good as its predecessor but was a safe movie bet, allowing you to fall back into a familiarity of the first and have some more fun with it. Joining the original cast is a new set of players including American PIE regular Eugene Levy, parody - movie regular Carmen Electra and another batch of kids and teens."
6071,"Yes, Carrey is right at home with his zany character, and totally overshadows Leoni in every single aspect. Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni work very well together. While Carrey and Leoni do their best, it's Leoni who gives a stronger performance. Jim Carrey does his trademark craziness well in this one. The supporting players, mainly Alec Baldwin and Richard Jenkins make good contributions to the film."
6072,"The athletes are always, ALWAYS treated with the utmost respect. a good film, an excellent cast, and the brand of comedy one can only expect from the Farrelly Bros. . Excellent performances by Knoxville, Heigl, and especially Jed Rees and Bill Chott for their unforgettable performances as Glen and Thomas (both from Galaxy Quest). This was a labor of love, on both sides of the camera. Audiences learn, just like Steve, that the athletes are fun to hang out with and they can do nearly as much as anyone else can."
6074,"Mr Bean fans will have their moments. It has the predictability of a Stan and Ollie routine, Morecambe & Wise or any other such comedians who mix story telling with visual and verbal humour. The action is gentle paced and contains no surprises, as the plot opener spells out the likely twists and turns. All of the main characters are funny in their own way particularly Rowan Atkinson and Maggie Smith. It also has a lot of very deep things to say about marriage and religion (Atkinson plays a shy, self - absorbed country vicar with a beautiful wife and daughter whom he neglects) without indulging in the usual superficial post-modern ironic attacks on either institution."
6076,"Malick shows great and rare confidence with this picture. Perhaps, but they are the film's two most brilliant qualities. Q'Orianka Kilcher is a magnificent creature that embodies the essence of nature and beauty. True to form, Malik affords the world of this film as much character as the humans themselves possess. It helps that Malick uses natural light for his shots, giving the scenery more life and texture."
6077,"The design in the film is extraordinary, and there are so many frames that are simply beautiful. Suffice it to say that the climax blends tragedy and hilarity with a degree of success that few directors could hope to match. The soundtrack works well at suitable moments, infusing classic into this art - house film. Geum - ja was able to put on a quite a good by finding faith and making public speeches. Film opens with the release of Lady Vengeance, a. k. a. "" The Witch "", a. k. a. "" kind - hearted Geum - ja "", played by the elegant Yeong - ae Lee."
6081,"The actual good parts come in the form of a few things. Another classic example of the difference between Boll and Wood, perfectly illustrated by BloodRayne, is that Wood's films made narrative sense. The opening credits take place over a nice little montage of paintings, then moves to a sunset in the mountains effectively establishing the mood in a surprisingly competent fashion. But the real gem here is Ben Kingsley, winner of one Academy Award and nominee for three others. They said it best in Showdown In Little Tokyo - beheadings are not as easy as they look."
6082,"And the set - dressing in those scenes are marvelous. The film is wonderfully lit, specifically in the torture chamber - scenes. He's more interested in scenes and ideas that move the story forward. One of the aspects of this film that made it so powerful was how Roth created a sense of helpless and inevitability. If you know Slovakia, you know that this movie was filming in Czech Republic (there is a lot of signs with czech language on it, also the language they speak is czech), which is lovely country with beautiful history."
6087,"All in all, worth the trip to the theater, and worth buying the DVD. Dialogues are well written and full of treats that makes this one a movie to see more than once. Some very catchy original tunes, well orchestrated and well sung. Plus their were clever references and homages sprinkled throughout which the any intelligent moviegoer will appreciate. This is a very fast paced movie that plays to the two levels successful animated films play to: The kids are entertained, but so are the parents."
6089,"And the trailer's funny parts were, well, just somewhat humorous. Many others watch a film like this and say, "" What's funny? The film is segmented into a few phases which all sort of fall short of funny. By making people laugh more, perhaps it would ease tensions. That said, his new film, "" Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World "", offers an unforgettable trip to some exotic locations in search of laughter, which is something Mr. Brooks does best."
6092,"Yimou Zhang clearly demonstrates why he is one of the best. Zhang Yimou possess a good eye for casting. The cinematography is amazing, as usual in Yimou Zhang movies. A brilliantly done foreign film that proves director Yimou Zhang isn't just an action freak. Shinobu Terajima is seen briefly as Riu."
6094,"Sure its simple minded, predictable, and a bit schmoltzy, but it is really great. None the less these kids do a wonderful job; they give performances both humorous and nuanced. The emotions and the feelings evoked by the whole affair in the situation is realistic and very funny. All of the actors did a great job, especially Josh Hutcherson (Gabe) and Charlie Ray (Rosemary). The Wonder Years) turns in another solid effort and shows he is anything but complacent - He gets great work out of his actors and the cinematography makes Manhattan a sparkling place for all."
6096,"The characterizations are subtle yet complex. Despite the bleak conditions portrayed in the movie, there are moments of wonder and comedy and great love. An impressive production all round, with cinematography by Giles Nuttgens, who collaborated with w - d Mehta on her trilogy installments: FIRE 1996 and EARTH 1998; music complements from Mychael Danna, who participated with w - d Mira Nair in "" Monsoon Wedding "" and "" Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love "" and on fellow Canadian filmmaker Atom Egoyan's ventures. Sure, there are a few moments of unsubtle prodding in the film, but the fine acting and smart writing overcame any moments of forced drama. He choices are also constrained by circumstance From an outsiders point of view, John's character seems to have it all, respect, a sweet mom (Waheeda)."
6098,"Marc Rothemund does a very good job on directing this movie, and Julia Jentsch is very convincing. It sticks very closely to its title, and only deals with the last days of Sophie Scholl. Having staked out such a narrow subject, Marc Rothemund is able to narrate the story in great detail. Sixty years after their deaths, their story is told and their memory cherished. Much literature and most films, portray heroism as dramatic, with feats of daring and thrilling actions."
6099,"The scenes at The Bonneville Salt Flats are stunning and picturesque. Complete and convincing performances that warm the heart and show true humanity shining through. Outstanding cameos by the likes of Annie Whittle and Diane Ladd simply add depth and verisimilitude to the film. Every scene is a jewel in this movie, and the cumulative effect proves that extraordinary films do not have to cost bazillions of dollars and take two years of computer - generated special effects to WOW their audience. Writer / Director Roger Donaldson has been very prolific in his Hollywood career creating mostly slick, ho - hum projects such as "" The Recruit "", "" Thirteen Days "", "" Dante's Peak "" and "" Cocktail ""."
6102,"Apart from the brilliant performances from all involved, this was a beautifully filmed piece of work. The staging and vivid colours used were absolutely perfect and each set was full of things to catch your eye. It really was a lot of fun and quite the breath of fresh air for children's movies since the slump between The Incredibles and now. For children, it sets their minds imaginations into over-drive. Rather than basing its entirety on the naughty kids storyline, McPhee jumps from plot point to plot point, stuffing a whole lotta characters and twists into it's 97 minute running time."
6105,"It surrounds the conception, pre-production, production, and post-production of Dave Chappelle's 2005 Brooklyn Block Party. And at it's heart, it's just about everyone â€” the fans, the artists, the theatre audience, and Chappelle â€” just having a good time. The fans and the artists and Chappelle forged a culture at this party, and this culture is infectious. It isn't a concert film, but features a hefty amount of highlight performances. this movie was outrageously funny due to the brilliant comic Dave Chappelle."
6106,"the acting is excellent and the lead actresses are completely captivating. In fact, most of the actors here really are excellent in their parts and their timing is brilliant. you will fall in love with the actresses. Unlike other films of the same genre, the characters are well developed and multi-layered. The other performances are subtle, with all of the tenderness, heartbreak, humour, intensity and confusion that the script asked of the performers."
6107,"As such, it is very much worth seeing, of you are interested in how Lovecraft's stories would have been filmed when they first were written, and / or are interested in 20s impressionism in general. if you liked this film, which is by far the best representation to have hit the screen based on his works, then grab a book, take the phone of the hook and prepare to have your wits extracted anally. Direct influences to the style are Metropolis, Faust, and Nosferatu; 3 great silent movies. There are some very nice extras on the DVD which explain the process of making the film, how a backyard was used to build sets, and what went into making a modern silent film hold true to the look and feel of the genre. Because of its format, TCOC takes a little patience but overall it's a lot of fun to watch and manages to build a fair amount of suspense and tension even as it amuses."
6114,"While there are comedic elements, there are also several sweet and poignant scenes. It is truly a character study of many different individuals, all of them reflecting on life as the events unfold before their eyes. But seriously, the conversations in this movie are wild and definitely make you think, and there are some funny parts too, and. Although it features a cast full of popular young stars, London is not an easy sell in the slightest. Stratham gives a powerful performance, which for some reason screams of Bruce Willis's "" finer "" work."
6126,"The movie is perfectly put together, so if you haven't read the comics you will be on the edge of you seat the whole movie. And lastly, the visual effects is fantastic, and the action scenes is nothing but spectacular. Everything looks beautiful, dark yet vibrant. Hugo Weaving is terrific and Natalie Portman leaves Princess Amadala far behind with her performance as Evey. Albeit, this is a Wachowski Brothers revolution, meaning there must be wildly theatric heroes and crisply tailored CGI stunts all set comfortably in an oppressive Totalitarian society."
6128,"First time director does a nice job - and the opening credits are noteworthy. but this will be one of the most entertaining cult movies ever. The charming monster with human sides. So are the various casting choices â€“ the amount of respected actors that have been crammed into supporting roles in impressive (Robert Duvall, Sam Elliot, William H. Macy) and give rise to an almost familiar and "" feel - good "" tone in the film. The performances are excellent across the board, from William H. Macy's crusading Senator to Rob Lowe's smirking Hollywood agent who struts around his office in a kimono."
6131,"Unforgettable Tsotsi is gorgeous, riveting, poignant, and thrilling. top performances by the talent of tsotsi, with the supporting cast all being equally impressive. Mr. Hood got excellent performances all around. A great cameo performance by Presley Chweneyagae. watch this as soon as you're able to and enjoy tsotsi."
6136,"Bruce expresses no surprise or is at all humbled by the rather lofty, elevated circumstances he finds himself in. This film is about as interesting as watching someone's home movies. Murray introduces home movie footage of the man previously known as Doug Bruce, who seems little more than a spoilt, almost callow young man of privilege, which is the one constant of both incarnations of Doug Bruce: wealth and privilege. In addition to interviews with doctors, Bruce's friends, girlfriends and family members, the viewer also sees footage Bruce shot himself in the days following his break from memory. The most riveting emotional notes are in the first 10 minutes as Doug recalls the first hours of his amnesia and his complete feeling of being lost and real terror about not even knowing who he might be able to call to come pick him up from the hospital."
8533,"The performances, without exception, were all wonderful. Ms. Gill's lovely, sultry voice was a surprising epiphany. The most amazing part of this film were the astonishing performances by David Beazely, Mark Hildreth and Paul Anthony who plays the main role. Indeed, the contrast is notable and highlights Anthony's not too attempts at misplaced and miscounted youth. This film should have received Oscar nominations, certainly one for Best Picture."
6140,"You can tell the whole story when it has been so well documented like this from the very beginning right up to the present day every part of Daniels journey is either on tape or film whether it was documented by himself or the likes of MTV. Making full use of films, tapes, and recent interviews, Jeff Feuerzeig has produced a wonderful film that is as good a document of a man as modern techniques allow. This documentary brings emotional threads and creativity into play in a way that dissolves the usual harsh contrast between a story and it's telling. It's clear that the filmmaker has a deep appreciation and love for Johnston's work, and his world is painstakingly brought to life through animation, recreation, and wonderfully edited home movies and audio cassette tapes. It grants you unusual access to what's going on inside a the mind of a human being bursting with creative talent while simultaneously struggling to control the demons that haunt him."
6142,"For by the end of the film, everything is convincing. At times boring, the film is generally very engaging and interesting and it is well worth checking out to experience it as much as anything else. Yes, some of the astronauts - in - space shots went on a bit long, but the music is so beautiful. The musical score is again very unusual for sci - fi but it does capture a strange sort of otherworldy sombre air. The Earth people apparently make the two and one half million light year trip in a small earth orbiter from the late eighties utilizing an exotic technology announced by a smart looking guy standing in an orange grove."
6147,"That's fine, because a stylized manner of speech suits these extremely cool, stylized characters and sets the proper mood. Its style is refreshing, its dialoque fascinating, the performances powerful, and the story is both energetic and fun. The amazing attention to detail by Rian Johnson (the writer / director) and the incredible performances by Haas, Zehetner, and especially Joseph Gordon - Levitt marks this very commendable film. It is one of those interesting movies that could really be a cult classic. Nora Zehetner is a beautiful and beguiling femme fatale."
6155,"A heroine who spouts references and smart talk beyond her years. The tension mounts to a peak as the two characters uncover aspects of each other; the final resolution of the long encounter comes as a stunning surprise. Once home the beautiful space in which Jeff lives (the set decor is splendid, using sensitive colors in a cinematic way), the walls adorned with photographs of young models, seems a fitting space for a fine photographer. Hard Candy is an intense psychological drama, with incredible performances by both Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson. There is extreme moral confusion here, and the pedophile is actually a more sympathetic character than the girl."
6162,"The action in tom yum goong is phenomenal to say the least - tony jaa proves that ong bak was no fluke! In "" Tom Yum Goong "", Tony goes all the way to show you how talented he really is! More International success will give Tony Jaa access to a bigger budget, more talent (ie writers, language instructors, studios etc.) and allow him to grow. However, the choreography of the fights is amazing and very realistic, making this movie a worthwhile entertainment. His screen presence, skill and experience mean he could be as big or bigger than Jackie or Jet in the next ten years."
6167,"Her emotions and rebelliousness are raw and totally authentic. The performances are all top - notch: Norton is excellent as always, and Wood's character Tobe is perhaps the best realization of a teen ever committed to film. In conception and execution this is very much Jacobson and Norton's (co-producer) film. Judging from this film, he is a more poetic version of a 1970s Scorsese. And though all the supporting performances are excellent, Norton's powerful screen persona carries the weight of the film's strong atmosphere and tone."
6174,"Fantastic movie with a multitude of messages. Inspiring and heartbreaking moments with truly remarkable well - acted sequences. The young actors deliver their parts with aplomb which combined with excellent directing should make this a success. Zoe Weizenbaum was just a joy to watch, beautiful and earnest and lovable and willing to take amazing risks for the film. All of the children provide very genuine, endearing performances --- essential if the audience is going to empathize with them and their disturbing behavior."
6176,"During the boys' eventful day in Beverly Hills, a parallel to The Warriors, a favorite of Clark's, can be clearly drawn. Gee, sounds like some sort of counter-culture masterpiece right? It's a minor work that has moments of real power. After the roars of rage of his two previous films, Bully and the masterpiece Ken Park, the filmmaker lets more tenderness into his scenes than ever before. Ken Park certainly had moments of great tenderness, often between shocking moments (the concluding sex scene, which has been hailed by some as the most moving sex scene in cinema, certainly comes to mind), but Wassup Rockers has a different sense of tenderness."
6207,"Great work and a must - see for any Geri Blank / Amy Sedaris fan. And Paul Dinello is a reliable, humorous counterpart to Mr. Colbert once again. This movie was hilarious, probably the funniest movie at Sundance this year. For most of the time, it is fitfully funny if only because the scabrous screenplay takes no prisoners in its approach. Matthew Broderick actually has a bigger role as Noblet's adversary, the preening Roger Beekman."
6199,"Some of the veterans of the scene as well as some insightful outsiders give their interesting opinions to support the argument at hand. There is so many great interviews in here, and most of them are from really great people. It was also great to see '80s curiosities Accept and Quebec's own Voivod being represented. This is interesting stuff, and it's about time someone stood up and asked the questions, answered them, and presented it all in a package that no one can discount as being, "" low - brow . "" The questions and answers were intelligent."
6203,"The performances are excellent and the interviews interesting. The good moments rescue this enough to bring it up to a 7 out of 10. As a poet, his songs reflect a lyricism and love of language which make them a pleasure to hear. It also says a lot about Leonard Cohen that this group of extraordinary performers are so honored to pay homage to him. Moreover, Bono and The Edge speak eloquently and beautifully about Mr. Cohen."
6211,"One of the most striking features of this film is the participation of indigenous actors. This film doesn't take that head on, but presents a balanced realistic view, and perhaps an alternative aspect that most critics generally don't acknowledge. See this movie, and bring friends, particularly people who do not know this kind of faith in their lives. The actor who portrays the Waodani warrior - chief, Mincayani, is outstanding. The creators of this film were deeply moved when they learned of the original true - life event this film is based on, and they poured their all into making a film that would reach people on a more spiritual level than most Hollywood fare these days, without being preachy (thank heavens), and while maintaining the natural lure of an adventure story."
6224,"They are the most poignant, opportune and beautifully delivered voice overs in recent memory. the rest of the cast, the story, the direction, the score, everything--perfect. Joan Plowright gives one of the best performances of her career and that's no small claim. This beautiful and seemingly simple story is filled with startling gems. The film is a delightful way to spend time at the movies with great company."
6228,"Sarah Polley and Tim Robbins are absolutely fantastic. Finally, the use of Tom Waits for the final transition is sublime! Polley and Robbins are very good, as are the rest of the supporting cast. Isabel Coixet did a splendid work here of portrayal of the more inner parts of the human soul. The cast of characters is solid, and the supporting characters are developed enough so as to allow the viewer to understand, in basic terms, what brought them there."
6229,"This is a high quality movie in most terms. The support actors are good, the action and explosions are made by high standard. This theory attempts to explain the fact that a series of initial minor events apparently not interconnected can trigger a sequence of significant occurrences, producing unpredictable and complex result. Unlike other Wesley Snipes recent movies, this one was quite a surprisingly good movie. And Ryan Philliphe is a very promising upcoming actor, he really delivers probably the best acting (along with Snipes) in the entire movie."
6237,"Easily one of the creepiest but most interesting performance by a child in years. However Jodelle Ferland and Gilliam have made her a strong and intelligent child and she does manage on her own. This is largely achieved through Jodelle Ferland's stunning performance, her acting is so natural and captivating you are immediately won over by her. Tideland has become a dark, whimsical, charming and entrancing film. Easily his best film since The Fisherking."
6257,"Inventive gags and wacky humor are splendidly proceeded. It's bittersweet, and with moments that might touch you. Colorful and glamorous cinematography by Fabio Cianchetti. Overall, it was a nice story and it had some very touching moments. Attilio is a poetry teacher, deeply in love with Vittoria - who doesn't share instead the same feelings."
6238,"The story is told in such a way that you find yourself laughing in the strangest places, you get really shocked in other places and the communication between the persons is extreme and wild! Following the success of Blinkende Lygter and the not - so - great De GrÃ¸nne Slagtere, Thomas Jensen places this story in between, by providing a black comedy with a great mind. Funny and well written dialouge, great acting and an amazing story! Mixing biblical allegories, especially the story of Job (the Fall being also an essential part of the film, yet not actually in the plot itself), with modern drama and dark comedy, Adams Ã¦bler does not fit into traditional categories. With his brilliant authenticity in the character of the troubled reverend, Mads Mikkelsen ("" pusher "", "" bleeder "", "" blinkende luger "", "" de grÃ¸nne slagtere "") rises up from just being a good bi-actor, to becoming a complete artist of performance."
6266,"Danielle Panabaker also performed well, and will turn into a starlet sooner than later. Paul Newman and Ed Harris are spectacular in the movie (as with everything else they do). This is why the mini-series format was perfect. Schepisi's transitional moments between past and present were brilliantly conceived in the film. The supporting cast of Helen Hunt, Dennis Farina (hilarious), Kate Burton (wow), Philip Seymour Hoffman, Robin Wright Penn, Aidan Quinn, and Jeff DeMunn add up to an amazing ensemble."
6296,"There are a few moments that briefly hold interest, but these few oases are separated by vast deserts of boredom. But the nightmarish atmosphere of confusion and fear, enhanced by gruesome stop motion animation between scenes, is both compelling, disturbing and extremely effective in communicating the directors ideas. Selini is like a combination of Godard, Herzog and classic Czech animation - the kind of committed and convincing political film making that is increasingly rare these days. Maybe it would help to tease them out in writing: on one hand, there is the libertine, who does whatever he wants and seems to take particular joy in blasphemy on the other hand, there is the vicious authoritarian doctor, who feels legitimate in enjoying torturing the inmates even if he ciphers that enjoyment through his medical practice."
6302,"The 2002 Newark, New Jersey Mayoral race is something most voters in the U. S. could care less about. Shot with a hand held camera and edited on a Mac, Curry the film - maker mirrors the determination and resolve of his main subject, political challenger Cory Booker. While the subject of national and international politics has been the subject of many critically acclaimed documentaries, Street Fight concentrates on the 2002 Mayoral election in one urban city, Newark, N. J., which is wracked by homelessness, drug addiction and poverty. Repeated confrontations in the film make it clear that Curry had an opportunity to make himself the focus of a compelling side story, but he removes his ego completely. A good documentary that if you already despise politics will make you despise them more, and to those that like them, it will open your eyes to the ugliness that is just about all campaigns, especially here in the U. S."
6303,"As usual Hurt's performances stretch beyond impeccable to a level of authenticity one could only expect from someone who was actually there. Thankfully, everything is in the right place. It was done very well, well chosen actors and good performances. This film is worthy of all the plaudits that one can offer. This powerful and touching true story was filmed in the real locations with the support of the survivors of the massacre."
6310,"If Denzel Washington can be rewarded for best actor in Training Day then Bale deserves his just rewards for Harsh Times. Harsh Times is an intense film. Just one problem, and that is the way Freddy and Christians characters talk: "" Wassup dawg / dude / homie "", it's grating and annoying. His portrayal of Jim David, an ex-army ranger, is coated in layers of emotional complexity and psychological deterioration. HARSH TIMES is both sophisticated and ambitious, with intriguing character development."
6342,"Though after that, the film magically changes itself into a beautifully endearing coming of age drama complete with cute Japanese schoolgirls and blazing punk rock. Along the way, however, there are some very endearing moments. That being said, it was hugely enjoyable (though probably a good 15 minutes too long), and Bae Doo Na, who plays the gawky Korean exchange student, literally steals the film. the pace is a bit slower than usual teen movies but its much more mature and still ends up being funny. The latter better describes Nobuhiro Yamashita's Linda Linda Linda, a beautifully constructed study of young love, high school politics, and of course, rock and roll."
6345,"They have made their lives something to be proud of. You literally see these people grow up before your eyes--you share their struggles, dreams and triumphs. For all the differences in their back grounds, the participants are seem to have a similar trait - optimism and resilience, and it is satisfying to watch. The series does have a lasting value that is not present in entertainment based reality TV shows. 49up is still proof of that privilege and class are still advantages as much in 2006 as they were when the series was first shown in 1963."
6171,"A big plus for this film which elevates it slightly above generic formula is its beautiful locations often seen through epic aerial shots. As always, McKlellan is fun to watch, effortlessly bringing Teabing to life, and Reno suffices as Fache. While Audrey Tatou is annoyingly frail as Sophie Neveu, she is captivating and lovely and is able to project both charisma and presence on screen in this film. Tom Hanks makes Robert Langdon pretty accessible, given Hanks' everyman demeanor, and Audrey Tautou makes a believable Sophie Neveu. Sir Ian McKellan too, it totally fantastic, and really steals most scene's he appears in."
6172,"There were two good things about X-Men III. Angel - who figured prominently in the trailers is in the film for all of 3 minutes, as is Collossus. - Gone is the subtle, inventive dialog from parts 1 and 2. This could have been one of the best movies ever made. If you want to have a great time at the movies, this is a fun film to watch."
6173,"Yes, there are some very funny scenes. The movie definitely has its funny moments. Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston are superb - they are both so credible and organic in these roles. Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Anniston put in solid performances in a film that feels strikingly real at times. From there, there is the occasional amusing line and the scene where you see Jennifer Anniston's butt."
6606,"This is a fascinating story, and it is that which carries the documentary into such great channels. It's interesting of course, but a quick browse bypasses the raw emotions and oddness presented here. So he set out to find sponsors, and soon did in Stanley Best and Rodney Hallworth. And keep in mind, THAT is why the story has remained alive for the last 40 years. What is surprising is all the twists that viewers wouldn't expect."
6175,"Everything just looks so real in this movie. All in all, "" Cars "" is a visual feast outside and an effective storytelling inside. And along with those characters and personalities comes a story which yes, contains a well - traveled theme, but it comes with so much charm that even Grouchy McKilljoy's hard little heart can't help but be warmed. Sometimes they are some of the funniest clips in the movie! The film is also vibrantly colored, making use of a whole variety of shades of dark colors during the race, and warm ones whenever the scenes shift to Radiator Springs."
6439,"The adventures of the guy are interesting to follow, even though they aren't all that different from what most people go through at one or other stage of life. There is a certain group of guys, that somewhere in the deepest part of their heart dream about similar stories full of the sensibility and feelings. Here there is a kind of seamless intercutting of scenes, scenery, flashbacks, reality and fantasy that all melt together fluently as the director navigates through Ben's life and thoughts. But there is a wide array of noteworthy performances from the supporting cast, not just in Barry and Matt. It's funny, it's sexy and it's sweet â€“ puffed full of insights in Ben's narration."
6177,"What made it a classic also made it a prime target for re-making. The only positive thing to say is that for anyone who hasn't seen the original, it's worth a look--on DVD. As in the original, the plot is moved along by mysterious and terrible deaths. Damien is creepy enough, and there are some OK dream sequences that offer a couple of good jump scares. "" This is a well - produced, but uninspired re-make of the 1976 box - office revelation."
8089,"Other than that, everything was excellent. Great job and congratulations to Asghar Farhadi and Mani Haghighi. Farhadi is certainly a director of nerve. The performances here by stars Hedyeh Tehrani (Mozhdeh), Taraneh Alidousti (Rouhi), and Hamid Farokhnezhad (Morteza), are impeccable. Pantea Bahram as the neighbor Simin delivers a glowy performance."
6180,"Christopher Walken is here, and that usually means good news as he tends to play fun - and - interesting characters. The jokes come pretty fast, right from the get - go. Click is by far Adam Sandler's best movie. It's something a lot of people can relate to, and all of the characters in the movie contribute to the storyline very well. Click provides great comedy and Sandler's best dramatic performance in a movie."
6182,"Blazing with self confidence, Miranda Pristley is a monumental modern queen. He moves the film at such a sharp, fast clip that it feels like an accurately frenzied portrayal of the inner workings of the world of haute couture. Likewise, Emily Blunt, as Miranda's first assistant, does a wonderful job as an insecure, over compensating slave to someone else's expectation. In the real world, partners go through periods when they become absorbed by intense spells and relationships survive, because in good relationships partners support the long - term goals of their sig others. Fortunately, director David Frankel has come along well since his 1995 Woody Allen knockoff, the irritatingly unctuous "" Miami Rhapsody "", and one can see his progression in his smart work on episodes of "" Sex in the City "" and "" Entourage ""."
6183,"There's a good plot, wonderful sets, great acting and plenty of laughs. Bill Nighy delivers his lines with aplomb, smacking his lips as if he relishes each syllable. The supporting cast is truly stellar; Bill Nighy as Captain Davy Jones, Stellan Skarsgard as Bill' Boostrap' Turner and Naomie Harris as Tia Dalma are simply brilliant. If you liked Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl, you're going to have to love this one too. Some blockbuster movies pretend to be more than they actually are."
6184,"Be it at a matinÃ©e or as a future rental. All four principal actors are perfectly balanced, and they are strong enough to be wonderful foils to one another. Kate Hudson was perky as always, and did a splendid job; and anyone who has loved her mother over the years will find Goldie's "" clone "" just as lovely as ever. He tells the kids that some of them will go on to traditional or socially acceptable success, while some of them (pods, he calls them! ) Rounding out the cast, straight - man Matt Dillon's cool as always, and Seth Rogen, though woefully underused, brings an impressive laughs - to - screen time ratio."
6185,"Wow, the return of the clerks, indeed! If you liked the original Clerks, this is Kevin's Smith's masterpiece. but he impresses everyone with just the beautiful way of putting together his scenes. It mirrors the original Clerks, but it shows how much he's grown as a writer and a director. Clerks II is a worthy successor to Kevin Smith's 1994 debut, "" Clerks . """
6186,"Giamatti plays Heep very, very well. That Shayamalan has crafted a film that way ahead of its time. Giamatti, Howard, and Shyamalan himself are all very entertaining. One of the best parts of the movie is the music. It's a treat, as rare as Nights' films are."
6187,"Performances are likable all around, with Uma Thurman portraying G - Girl with believable ease. It's one of the funniest sex scenes ever. What's even more maddening is that, in certain scenes (such as when a very turned on Uma knocks a headboard through a wall), you sense a witty, raucous Reitman opus practically screaming to get out. She was great in Monster - In - Law and she was bad in Clerks 2. He's given two of the best comic performances of 2006 (the other in the pretty much unreleased Idiocracy)."
6189,"Equipped with these "" essential "" personal qualities, the charges traditionally made against Marie - Antoinette fade completely. Great actors â€“ Rip Torn, Danny Huston, Shirley Henderson â€“ are given nothing much more to do than push the narrative along its slow path. Based on the recent Marie - Antoinette biography by Antonia Fraser, Sofia Coppola's film focuses on the personal qualities of the character of Marie - Antoinette and thus participates in the character's historical rehabilitation. She is shown as both bold and humble, two qualities which had quasi-miraculous effects on both the court and the angry mob, as is shown in some of the film's most touching moments. Marie Antoinette is the film equivalent of one of those expensive fashion magazines that pepper indie art galleries â€“ packed with achingly hip aesthetics but free of meaningful content."
6190,"You have to start somewhere and GM, Ford, Toyota and Honda were the trailblazers and they all did it. But they, and a host of others, chose a different course. Yes, most of the people who apparently leased one of GM's electric cars were celebrities and / or people of some measure of wealth. The movie is filled with history, politics, technology, innovation, and some very interesting personalities. As a onetime owner of an electric car (the EV1) and a savvy filmmaker, he has quadruple checked his facts â€” and they are alarming."
6192,"The film is virtually flawless, even some of the cornier visuals fit in. And while he may have showed up for some six years ago as stiff and stodgy, in this context he is masterful in blending the informative with the entertaining. And, it's true that the CO2 is increasing at this moment. Subsequent analysis had shown the data are sharply skewed to reflect a stronger contribution from recent temperatures. It still may be an effective tool for educating democrats that were previously uninformed on global warming."
6195,"As a Disney channel movie, it inevitably has several flaws, the most obvious of which is the clichÃ©, cheesy plot between the two main characters. Like other movies "" Right on Track "", "" Go Figure "", "" High School Musical "" is a great movie which you can sit with family or with friends and enjoy and you never know when you might be singing along! If you're a fan of musicals you're sure to enjoy it. With some dance moves, the movie also added great humor, "" love "", and for those jocks out there BASKETBALL! ' High School Musical' is definitely one of Disney channel's best original movies up to date."
6196,"Apart from that, Fearless is remarkable. The film starts as it means to go on, and contains plenty of inventive action, the main highlights being a colossal one - on - one in a restaurant and of course the climactic four - way tournament. Michelle Yeoh, who makes a special appearance in Fearless, has been unfortunately removed. This is Jet Li's best movie in years. Though there are various interpretations, the essence is retained well in the movie."
6197,"Some really good change in this 3rd movie was the feature of drifts instead of pure racing (shown so far in the previous series). His mannerism is interesting during the California scenes and you actually do get to like him, however he quickly outwears his welcome. Basically this movie comes down to good looking cars, fast paced action, and Asian cleavage. THAT is the main innovation in this series as long as in cars movies. The acting is satisfactory (for a racing film, otherwise it would more or less suck), the plot and the dialogue are predictably terrible, the racing sequences are satisfactory and the cinematography is somewhat effective, with frequent close - ups of the cars."
6198,"In general, this is a good movie to enjoy a fearless Saturday afternoon out with your kids. If you want to see a good story that kids will like, then see this movie. Otherwise, this is a pretty bland movie and is firmly set to entertain young ones. It was colorful, well done, excellent quality, etc. but let's face it, by being designed for 5 - 10 year - olds, it also had to be really sloooooooow. Nothing too scary, nothing too rude, and lots of pratfalls, good one - liners, and fun to had by all."
6441,""" Ils "" don't have a great plot but it's not two minutes of suspense here and there. as many of the comments here stated, there isn't much of a plot, but the suspense and thrill is there and this is a very good scary movie. The murderers are the most interesting part of the film, and this is true in spite of the fact that they're kept off screen as much as possible. Every single creak and footstep is perfectly placed for the best scares. At least higher efficiency in only 77 mins, no gratuitous sex violence or gore, all are set to create the breathtaking atmosphere."
6200,"Kevin Spacey was a fine choice, among others. Some were wonderful, and others looked artificial despite being very detailed. The next 45 minutes of the film were awesome. Lex Luthor shows how truly evil he can be, and again Spacey does an amazing job here. The flight scenes were beautiful; Superman cut a very majestic figure as he soared across skylines and starscapes."
6202,"And with a good balance of acted reconstruction and subject interview, both the drama and technicalities feel great. A nation that stands for human rights and decent treatment of prisoners. "" The Road to Guantanamo "" is shot as a pseudo-documentary. This administration (and its blowhard allies) have done such a wonderful job convincing Americans that speaking out against their policies is tantamount to being unpatriotic. Voices of politicians (Jack Straw, Donald Rumsfeld), lawyers for the prisoners, and the chief legal officer of England, Lord Justice Styne, in a stunning rebuke, are also heard."
6596,"Lively and interesting backgrounds, lush colours and detailed animation, it's a joy to look at. The direction is interesting, with some really nice shots effectively conveying the more important events and scenes. It's a good movie for kids, teenagers, young adults, middle - ages and elders. It reminds you of a Ghibli movie due to its breathtaking use of rich colors and lavish texture, the film itself almost comes alive with its near perfect animation. All in all, if you look at it, the film is a touching tale bursting with emotions and it just warms your heart in all the right places."
6204,"Cast is tops, particularly Posey, Bailey and DeVito. The humor is dished up in the right amounts and in all the right places. The performances are probably the best thing about this film. Paul Rudd, Danny Devito, and Parker Posey each gave fantastic and thoughtful performances. Mischa Barton brings a certain ease and freshness to her role that may hint at even greater things to come."
6205,"The whole cast was great, Paul Dano, Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell playing really serious at first. Do yourself a favor and see this sweet, subtle at times and gut - bustingly hilarious at others, perfectly pitched ensemble piece. Keeping up with the recent buzz - worthy films coming out of Sundance the past couple years, Little Miss Sunshine is a gem of a movie. Her emotional reactions are spot - on and she has remarkable presence and a self - effacing nature that allows her to be who she is and not be ashamed about it, which is the main purpose of Olive Hoover. and Alan Arkin is funny in anything he does."
6208,"David Okrent, the former public editor of the Times, makes a surprise appearance. Pretty interesting look behind the curtain of the world of crosswords. Just as interesting though is the way the more traditional powerhouses react to his presence and apparent skill. It's funny, it's sad, there's angst, and tension, anticipation, there's "" ohhhhhhh "" and smiles, laughter and tears. There is a twenty - minute short about the film's reception at the 2006 Sundance Festival, including a Q&A with the top contenders, as well as a music video."
6210,"There is no doubt that they are all talented comics. the changing of littlemans daiper is hilarious. white chicks got good ratings this is so much funnier. The gorgeous Brittany Daniel, who was also in "" White Chicks, "" provides some great eye candy. Plus you'll get a lot more classic Bugs Bunny cartoons to boot!"
6580,"Selton Mello is perfect in the film, as well as the ambiance and direction. The movie is brilliant, and the character of Selton Mello even more. And the first sequence is a delight for the eyes, and also the main actor. But it actually showed to be very good and unusual, with the character LourenÃ§o becoming more strange, sick and bizarre as the time passes. The acting by Selton Mello, which plays LOURENÃ‡O, the main character, is excellent!"
6212,"Not the plot, the myriad celebrity voices, or even the decisively unique and dazzling computer animation. Like _ Polar _, it has a stylized look rather than attempting photorealism, but instead of taking the look of paintings in a book, it took the look of extremely detailed dolls and doll accessories. It is true that Monster House does contain a predominantly dark theme, with a considerable amount of eerie scenes to support it. The director took the script, and made complete storyboards from it. Besides the extraordinarily dark scenes it just feels like those very entertaining Spielberg productions of the eighties."
6213,"If you enjoy any of the following, then this movie is for you: gruesome deaths, breasts, cheesy physical humor, Samuel L. Jackson, or venomous reptiles. It's not the funniest movie of the year or the scariest, but it is a good movie if you're looking for mindless fun involving a lot of snakes on an airplane, some gratuitous gore and nudity, and a few great Samuel L. Jackson moments, check it out. It doesn't stand out above other movies, but it always keeps your attention. There is a plane in the air that has both venomous snakes and Samuel L. Jackson on board. Samuel L. Jackson is good, but his role is weirdly small."
6214,"Happily, the film exceeded expectations, at least a little bit. Compared to just about everything Hollywood is producing, Allen's stuff has a tendency to charm. Unlike his Ed Dobel sage character in Anything Else, or his blind director in Hollywood Ending, this time the character is a comfortable fit. He does limit his screen time and he is quite effective, except in two or three brief scenes that almost seem out of place. It's nothing heavy, nothing deep--and not anywhere as good as any number of real Allen masterpieces--but it's also completely enjoyable as a light, bantering comedy."
6215,"Thank goodness this is much better than the ill conceived BETWITCHED Farrell did in 2005. You could tell Will Ferrell and Sacha Cohen (aka Ali G) and John C. Reilly all had the opportunity to improvise lines and riff on one another, and all three were pretty good. So it's a good movie, a lot of gut laughs, and not unlike Dodgeball or Anchorman or the like. In theory, this should be hilarious, but in reality Talladega Nights just doesn't hold up. Along for the ride is the ever - so - versatile John C. Riley as perennial sidekick Cal Naughton Jr. who literally finishes second to him in every race."
6216,"The characters are likable enough and the situation is definitely full of possibilities. The movie is well paced, jumping almost directly into the action, with plenty of laughs. Also, a fantastic group of supporting characters like Gus, Mr. McPhee and Atilla the Hun. It was good to see Dick Van Dyke, Andy Rooney and Bill Cobbs in light, comic roles, and Robin Williams in a solid supporting role. The film has huge plot holes and probably hundreds of continuity errors but rampaging dinosaurs, goodish CGI and another athletic comic turn from Ben Stiller, together with the gorgeous Carla Gugino make this near perfect Xmas cinematic fair."
6217,"The 45 minutes of "" World Trade Center "" are terrific. Pena (last seen as the locksmith in "" Crash "") is instantly likable as Ofc. A couple of moments with Pena standing there on the concourse were effective in creating a sense of horrific surrealism, and the moments right before the collapse were sudden and chilling. Stone's storytelling is also more methodical and straightforward than it's been in recent years. The first 45 minutes of the movie showed what Stone truly is capable of doing."
6218,"Ferrel gets to show some nice range here, and much like Robin Williams did with "" The World According to Garp "" and Jim Carrey did with "" The Truman Show, "" graduates with honors into more high - minded quasi-serious roles. Will Ferrell gives a remarkable break - out performance in a straight role, reminiscent of Jim Carrey in The Truman Show. As someone else said, Hoffman is perfectly understated. Helm's screenplay coupled in with an intoxicatingly great performance by Ferrell make for a great trip to the movies. Original storyline, fantastic performance from Ferrel, Thompson and Hoffman."
6219,"It lacked everything that made MV great. The acting by Farrell and Foxx is first rate and some of the opening scenes are eye candy of the highest order. What saves the film from being a bust is the visual splendor and great action sets. Visually Miami Vice was stunning, the usage of digital cameras when shooting this added lot to the realism. Mann once again proves that when it comes to creating a gritty atmosphere and staging shootouts, he's among the best in the business."
6221,"This is one of the best films of this year. The climactic scene is as powerful and cathartic as The Shawshank Redemption's golden moment. Will Smith is terrific, his son Jaden is just perfect, and Thandie Newton puts in a convincing supporting act. His acting, along with Thandie Newton and Jaden Smith, were great. It's very funny at parts, but be prepared for some serious drama."
6222,"Unpopular girl becomes popular, snobby girls become unpopular girls friend just to crush the unpopular girl in the end leading to the feel good fairytale ending! Arielle Kebbel may not be a fantastic actress but she does have an engaging quality about her and she had a few good lines. As solid as "" Bring it On, "" it is definitely a notch above the average teen comedy; not quite "" Mean Girls "" but a good substitute. Shame about his limited acting ability though, as the infamous John Tucker was simply a more confident version of his "" Desperate Housewives "" character John Rowland, but nevertheless, Metcalfe seems to enjoy his characters, and certainly makes them come to life. Actors aside the movie as a whole was enjoyable and exciting."
6223,"funny bits enough to over look the "" message "" at the end. Of course the story isn't anything new per se but it moves at a steady pace and the characters are very likable. The actors voices and characterization are terrific. Julia Roberts and Nicolas Cage are the two biggest names in a strong cast that lends their voices to their cartoonish alter egos. Besides, there's no harm in enjoying some laugh - out - loud moments."
6573,"Patrick Fugit (known for Almost Famous) gives an amazing performance. Patrick Fugit was fantastic in his role, as were all of the other actors. The acting is well done and the characters believable and quite well developed. The sound works well, and visual effects are only ever momentarily cheesy. There is a temptingly meaningful logic at work that will leave you fitting the pieces together long after the film has finished."
6227,"He's a pure physical presence with a maniacal glint in his eyes. A thrill every ten to fifteen seconds is more like it. It packs over the top action in with incredible stunts, clever and biting humor, a decent story and some above average acting. And Jason Statham's such a great actor--his performances in Snatch and Lock Stock are terrific. it has everything that can keep your heart pumping for the whole movie."
6447,"The production design and music are exquisitely 50s, to a tee. Fido's talented headliners (Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connelly, Dylan Baker, and Tim Blake Nelson) stand as a testament to the brilliance of the script. Fido tackles all these possibilities in a sweet and surprisingly classy way, with much thanks to the work of Connelly (as one of said zombies) and young TV actor K'Sun Ray, who seems at times to be a better young Elijah Wood than the young Elijah Wood was. A super cast helps: Carrie - Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Czerny, Tim Blake Nelson, Mary Black and Sonja Bennett are the principals, aided by young K'Sun Ray as Timmy, the innocent kid with a good heart who acts as fair witness to all the lunacy of the grownups. But intelligent comedies that stay funny from start to finish are among the hardest won achievements in movie - making."
6550,"Justin Timberlake and John Larrquette offer the most accomplished performances. While Dwayne "" the Rock "" Johnson gives his best performances to date. You can get a pretty good idea of Southland Tales from a quick description of its characters. By sheer contrast, Southland Tales is a huge step down from his previous film. Cheers for the most original film of 2007!"
6449,"Rescue Dawn had these moments of brilliance, and the rest seemed like a very well made thriller / action movie. "" Rescue Dawn "" features classical and feverishly transcendent direction from Herzog, breathtaking cinematography of Laos and Vietnam from Peter Zeitlinger, a triumphant and evocative music score from Klaus Bedelt, and Oscar - worthy performances from an amazing cast. Herzog puts the cast through the ringer in artistically rendered depictions of torture, horror, and survival in the harshest of conditions. With the arrival of Dengler, a new spirit emerges among the group, and an escape plan soon hatches. It simply tells the story of this incredibly courageous and resourceful man, Dieter Dengler."
6256,"If you want chills down your spine, by all means, watch it! It's most valuable to see by those who are NOT fundamentalists to understand a growing and already substantial movement of which most are not aware exists. Children are highly impressionable and mostly believe what adults tell them. One thesis he advances is that the world is changing so fast it's threatening the adjustment of many cultures and sub-cultures. Peer pressure works both ways--when they're mainly around others with the same background, that will serve to keep most in line."
6230,"are top - notch and the mood established here--namely, the chilly, lonely dark exteriors of Wisconsin and New York--give a terrific framing for this story. Everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility, and real life just sort of plods along â€” no? Based on real events that happened to Armistead Maupin (who co-wrote the screenplay with Terry Anderson) and directed by Patrick Stetner, this film moves a lot faster (90 min. the casting, the script, the little bits of humor sprinkled in it. For quality and content alone, The Night Listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days."
6234,"With STEP UP, you have a strong story, incredible music, wonderful young actors in a diverse world, and the hope that now their young lives can really begin. Unlike similar movies where the audience agonizingly waits through scene after scene of boredom for a grand dance finale (which usually fails to enthrall anyway), Step Up treats the audience to several impressive, memorable sequences thoughtfully scattered throughout the movie. This is a class B + film with moderate continuity errors and dialog mishaps. Duane Adler and Melissa Rosenberg have created a film in STEP UP that just hits your heart and soul with the character development created through the actors music and dance, and the sets and costumes which fit each character. The movie has romance, comedy, tragedy, and nearly everything else you would want in a good movie."
6235,"From X-Men and Sky High to Spy Kids and Fantastic 4, on and on, this movie steals from everyone. If the one liner isn't enough to make you laugh, add the highly adorable factor from Ryan Newman as Cindy Collins is tops. It is a movie that makes fun of super hero movies. And to keep things consistent, all the rest of the songs in the movie are also outdated. This movie featured Smash Mouth and they did a lot of songs, some their own and some covers."
6236,"This is what superb performances do. Epps also led the list of six of this year's breakthrough performances by the New York Times. Music (by "" Broken - Social - Scene "") is timely applied at certain segments but sparingly. Only this film focuses on the lives of one teacher and student in an intimate and up - close way. "" Half Nelson "" is a spare, original story with exquisitely natural and fresh performances delivered by Ryan Gosling, Shareeka Epps and Anthony Mackie."
8429,"Lo comments repeatedly on the fact that he had a good cinematographer, and indeed the lighting is excellent throughout, so, as he says, this looks like a movie that cost much more to make. The cast Lo has selected is fine - especially the promising young Nick Bartzen and the solid Barry Shay. By contrast, Jordan is a lively character with ultra good looks. The sets are nice and well touched up. CONRAD BOYS is not a bad movie: the story though frequently used by others holds its own, the style of direction keeps the pace moving, the message of the movie is worth stating."
6533,"They always do good work and they've chosen another gem for their roster of releases. Overall: cool fights and a finale almost (repeat: ALMOST) on a par with the legendary finale of A Better Tomorrow 2. The action scenes were certainly effective, with plenty of stylized Tae Kwon Do all over the place. The action and fighting scenes and sequences were really nicely choreographed and executed. He choreographed some excellent fighting scenes."
6240,"The rest of the cast also did their jobs perfectly, this is an excellent little film with a nice message. All the cast delivered fantastic performances--hire this one out with a friend, it's a bloody crack up! He's priceless delivering his thoughts on middle class angst. With this well thought out story and with laughs mixed in, this is a good movie. While the plot is a little off - beat, everybody in the making of this movie pulled off a pleasant flick good for many a laugh."
6242,"This movie was stunning in many aspects. Visually in terms of locations, inside and out, there was great consistency and a nothing seemed strained. The illusions are captivating and almost believable. The special effects and illusions are entertainment enough. As an actor, he speaks volumes with his eyes."
6243,"Loud music and vivid performances help. A moment that may have felt like surrender to Elizabeth II is the most moving and powerful moment in a film filled with moving and powerful moments. Director Stephen Frears recreates one week in 1997 with intelligent, deft strokes. The design of The Queen's home and her surroundings are convincing without being overly showy, and the Alexandre Desplat score is by turns dark, sad, and grand, perfectly summarizing the mindset of those involved. As a young and newly elected Tony Blair with big aspirations and an even bigger grin, Michael Sheen is freakishly good as the Prime Minister."
6244,"Beerfest was top notch of it's class. When the movie opened with warning labels like this, you know you're ready for a great movie. The participation of Willie Nelson in the end is hilarious and a good hook for a "" Potfest "". Within this genre, the latter is a fine movie as well--BeerFest simply stays on track a little better, instead of being a slapdash montage of funny scenes. So, if you are looking for a good laugh and an all around good time go see Beerfest you will not be disappointed."
6248,"If so, it's a fine portrayal of an undistinguished IQ addled with anti-depressants. In reducing matters to a sexual, as opposed to a religious power - struggle, LaBute presents the flimsiest of qualifiers for a harvest sacrifice. Prior to this release, Neil LaBute had this to say about the 1973 original: "" It's surprising how many people say it's their favorite soundtrack. One more thing: keen credit watchers may have noticed that films sporting an unusually high producer count (anything up to 10) tend to be Not Much Cop. Throw it on the scrap heap with all the other remakes that have sullied the good names of the films they were' based' on (in this case very loosely)."
6249,"The overall look and quality of the film resembled that of a mid-80's Egyptian soap opera dubbed into French. 1, with 1 being the lowest rating on IMDb after over 1 , 200 votes. If you want to see streetball just rent the And1 Mix Tape tours, even though they are a jumble of random moves, they are still better action then Crossover. The on - the - court scenes contained lots of edits and cut - aways that marked staged shots."
6250,"This is a truly great film and well deserving of the Palm D'Or. Cillian Murphy is wonderful and quite possibly the best Irish actor ever. Some magical performances not only from the stars, but from the whole cast. Another powerful movie from Ken Loach and a well deserved winner of the Palm D'or at Cannes. This film brilliantly covers the 1920/21 wars from the Irish perspective."
6251,"A solid 3 star experience that hopefully has some extra bits come home - entertainment time. The plot is pretty clever and the characters are likable. The likable cast give sterling performances and manage both the comedic and horrific elements with ease. The story is gripping and the cast is excellent - some of the finest British actors give star performances - in particular a stellar performance from Danny Dyer. Director Christopher Smith, who also made the rather humdrum Creep, handles the action well, and the film moves at a brisk pace delivering plenty of chills and thrills along the way."
6252,"Ben Affleck does a phenomenal job in portraying Reeves. Both near perfect performances and as for the rest of the cast, there is not a poor performance to be found in this film. The performances of Larry Cedar, Bob Hoskins, and Lois Smith also stand out especially distinctively. , powerful scenes, great acting and a compelling story. Adrien Brody was his best since "" The Pianist "", and Ben Affleck was his best since."
6253,"Everyone did their jobs and all made believable teenagers. Along the centuries, the power and the covenant are transmitted through their descendants and when the eldest son is eighteen years old, he ascends to a higher power. Lots of really attractive actors and actresses. In the present days, four wizards teenage friends are in high school and their leader Caleb Danvers (Steven Strait) is close to his eighteenth birthday and consequently to ascend. If you enjoy movies that are part supernatural, part comic book, and part TV movie, you will like this."
6254,"Certainly all performances in the film hold up pretty well. All the interactions between the characters follow the theme of the film; it is realistic. "" SherryBaby "" is by far grittier in its depiction and the tumultuous emotional journey complete. Maggie Gyllenhaal emerges as an undeniably powerful actress in the title role of this low - budget 2006 indie. Undoubtedly, Maggie Gyllenhaal's performance in the film reeks of Oscar - bait for it is simply an excellent performance."
6255,"Hilarious from start to finish (stay until after the end credits! ) The film has some truly awesome showcases of realistic retardedness put on a pedestal. As movies go, this is a fairly gentle education. Excellent, sharp, witty comedy, as well as an engrossing plot make this DVD one for the ages. Maya Rudoulph is also surprisingly good as a former "" painter "" who was frozen as well."
6258,"The casting was superb: Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman are outstanding in their roles, with both offering utterly believable performances. The use of micro-photography made the visual effects gorgeous. Weisz has the depth for regal intrigue and spirited grace. The acting is absolutely superb, but then it's got Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. It is a score that perfectly emulates the feeling, emotions and mood of the film."
6260,"There's something magical about this wonderfully sweet romantic fantasy by Michael Gondry. This is Gondry's immense visual world unrestrained by a script by Charlie Kaufman, and this world of fancy and imagination is where the film flourishes. Michel Gondry has created something really wonderful here, the kind of film worth seeing again and again. Michel Gondry's subtle genius shines brilliantly in the interviews. Much like last year's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, where it was unfiltered Shane Black on the screen; The Science of Sleep is pure Gondry from start to finish."
6261,"From the start, even with its problems, the audience knows it is in the hands of a style master, and in that regard, the film is consistent and on the mark. While Brian De Palma's "" The Black Dahlia "" has much of the look and feel of Curtis Hanson's 1997 "" L. A. Confidential, "" that far superior film boasted better performances and a well - written screenplay. Dante Ferretti's set design beautifully evokes the 1940's; Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography enhances the period look; and the voice - over narration has been pulled from film - noir classics. Supporting work, especially from Mike Starr, Fiona Shaw and the flashback heavy Kirshner, are all on the mark and are fairly well done in their limited roles. It has all the trappings of a first - rate detective novel (James Ellroy) made into a 1940's thriller with appropriately moody music of the soulful trumpet (Mark Isham), lush production design (Dante Ferretti), and equally impressive costuming (Jenny Beavan), all set in a timelessly seedy Los Angeles."
6262,"Take your kids to see it and enjoy. Whoopi Goldberg is perfect as the the old bat (heh heh). This is the first of the lot that really should have been made into 3D. But baseball, while prominent to the plot, is one of the skins wrapped around the substance; at its heart is a story about the importance of family and persistence, making it a nice tribute to the Reeves. Yankee Irving (Jake T. Austin) was born to New York fans with a love of baseball."
6265,"There are people who are seemingly happy and then go further and further into feeling as if there is no end, there are others who are, needless to say, clinically insane (or some who, as a given, are looking for attention in a supremely dramatic way). This film was a gifthorse to the film - maker and has the deep potential to throw up disturbing images to the vulnerable. It's an excellent documentary that makes no judgements. There is, of course, the final and ultimate slight, which is to have filmed the suicides without their permission, having set up their cameras with the expressed purpose of doing so. There is a fitting tribute to the jumpers at the end, all being credited by individual name and when they jumped during 2004."
6505,"It is filled with fascinating, carefully chosen, artfully constructed sequences which replay beautiful and dark moments of the past 60 plus years and puts them into context. Henriette Mantel and Steve Skrovan's An Unreasonable Man insightfully and objectively chronicles the life of Ralph Nader and his interactions with society. Its so fast - paced, information packed, emotional, exciting, engaging, enRaging, and occasionally hilarious that when seeing it in a movie theater you should buckle your seatbelts! This documentary is a chronicle of Ralph Nader's life and times, with an above - average dose of commentators. While it's friendly to the man, it also lets some of his most vitriolic political opponents (Gitlin, Alterman) speak out loud and clear."
6292,"The beautiful cinematography by J. Michael Muro does wonders to create the right atmosphere in which the action is presented. There is something majestic watching those horses run. The set was gorgeous and the horses are beautiful. Its about time someone came out with a clean, funny, suspenseful, and outright wonderful family movie. It's also an Alison Lohman film and in all fairness contains one of her best performances."
6268,"Apocalypto is certainly Gibsons finest work. Apocalypto is the perfect action film, punctuating its frenzy of activity with beautiful and surprising images. The most remarkable performances by an ensemble cast of unknowns. The images in this film are breathtaking, shot with the genesis digital cameras this is the best looking digital film out to date, the cinematography is superb, the costumes, make up and art direction are top notch. Apocalypto is probably one of the ten best movies of the year, a compelling action movie with not only adrenaline, but also brains and heart."
6269,"Performances were good, and Jean Reno was great as the captain of the Lafayette Escadrille. There were quite a few men that made up the Esquidrille and all were very interesting. The close ups seemed a little fake but the tactics seemed really good. The Planes look magnificent, but could have been done better. You will love the scenes with Whiskey, their mascot lion."
6270,"Some of the funniest bits are the pranks the guys play on themselves, and they have no regard for what happens to them. Jackass Number Two in all honesty was grosser, more obscene, funnier and more entertaining than the first. The stunts are over the top and the pranks are funnier and more outrageous than ever before. That's classic comedy taken to new extremes with the liberties of an R - rating. The original had a few notorious stunts, and there is at least one stunt that this movie will be remembered for."
6271,"Cohen manages to create genuine laugh out loud moments. As Borat travels through America, there is a wealth of juxtapositions to be found when he interacts with the people â€“ members of the white house, television broadcasters, etiquette teachers, Christian fundamentalists and Jews â€“ all offers layered hilarity and a consistent cloud of laughter kept hovering in the air. As an actor he is unmistakably brave and uninhibited, which makes it easy for the film to lose itself in a tornado of gags, spoofs, bizarre one - liners and graphic jokes. ' Borat' is without a doubt one of the most original and ingenious comedy in the last three years, and maybe, just maybe, the funniest film ever made. It is apparent that Sascha Baron Cohen has done something truly cool here and has created an anti-semitic, misogynist and bigoted character that aptly embodies all racy taboos."
6272,"Brutal but beautiful, magical yet earthy, it has a remarkable cast, with standout performances all round. The sheer artistry recalls Cocteau's La Belle at la BÃªte. The film features a fantastic performance by Sergi Lopez as Captain Vidal and as central character Ofelia, newcomer Ivana Baquero delivers the performance of a seasoned veteran. The performances are great, mainly from Sergi LÃ³pez, Maribel VerdÃº and the big revelation of the film: the 12 years girl Ivana Baquero. But "" El Laberinto del Fauno "" is most compact, most mature and best done in very aspects, and perhaps it's the most personal movie from Del Toro."
6273,"Remember how good you thought The Incredibles was? The animation was well done, the cast was great, and there were some very creative action scenes in this movie. Predictable kiddie fare with okay animation and some good throwaway moments here and there. The 3D IMAX is truly amazing, if you are already paying the theater admission then IMAX is definitely the way to go. Aston Kutcher was hilarious as Eliot."
6274,"Everyone was extremely solid and everything seemed so real. In IA, it is a convincing many years. Several of the scenes were filmed with such artistry that they set a new standard in beautifully realised intensity. And easily one of the best remakes of all time. The true stand out performance has to go to DiCaprio."
6275,"Ermey is on hand giving another terrifying performance as Hoyt. The acting in the film is very good there are some very intense performances and some graphic scenes. This is a highly worthy and satisfying entry in the horror series that will make an indelible mark on your imagination, if not already done by the seemingly endless spew of remakes and graphic horror films. This story is in 1963, right before the events of the 2003 film which took place in the early seventies. R. Lee Ermey plays a major character instead of a bit - player like in the 2003 remake, and the film benefits from this."
6291,"He conveyed much more warmth and had much more depth than the other "" leads . "" plus detailed period scenes on the home - front. This film will receive many Oscar nominations. This film reminds you why movies are important. The picture became one of the most famous images of the U. S. winning a battle during WWII."
6276,"Over all, good movie, great laughs, fun time! The story was great and there are many funny scenes in this movie that makes it cool to work at one of those stores. The thing that always makes workplace comedy the funniest is the truth of the situations the characters find themselves in. Employee of the Month is a quirky comedy with a substantial story and charming characters. It doesn't have anything new to offer but some of the jokes work well and the sequences with Cook and Shepard competing against each other do make one chuckle."
6277,"From the first minutes of the film, you know that you're in for a thrilling adventure. The film is reasonably watchable, probably because it only lasted 90 minutes. The special effects and the action are above average, the performances from Mickey Rourke, Ewan McGregor and Bill Nighy are great and Alex Petyfer is an appealing enough lead, the soundtrack is nice and the film goes along at a fast pace. Alex Rider, played superbly by Alex Pettyfer, is very believable as a school kid thrown into the deep end by Bill Nighy who hams it up brilliantly as spymaster Alan Blunt. And One Of The Most Exciting Part Of The Book Is The Quad Bike Chase, Thats Absent From The Film And Is a Real Let Down!"
6278,"Brian Cox, Joseph Cross, and a great Jill Clayburgh really were amazing. Ms. Bening's performance is raw and spontaneous. But, most of the time this is a surprising, smart comedy of pains with a sensational Annette Bening - her best performance without a doubt - her disintegration is, apart from everything else, shattering and absurdly entertaining. Joseph Cross as Augusten was wonderful. The cast was all superb, especially Annette Benning and Jill Clayburgh."
6279,"Even though this part of the story arc ties in nicely the movie would have been better without it. Because it is constantly switching back and forth between three different subplots, it is difficult to get attached to any of the characters. If you must see it, wait for the DVD. The Last story arc is Aubrey's (The stunning Amber Tamblyn) which is set a few days after the event (Karen setting the house on fire) occurred. In Chicago, Trish (Jennifer Beals) moves to the apartment of her boyfriend Bill (Christopher Cousins), who lives with his children, the teenager Lacey (Sarah Roehmer) and boy Jake (Matthew Knight)."
6280,"Great performances from Robin Williams and Laura Linney. After too many dark turns, Williams is finally back to what he does best. The supporting actors give great performances, especially Laura Linney and Chris Walken. If you want something to laugh at however, Robin Williams and Christopher Walken are not their usual selves. It is similar to Barry Levinsons other comedies, funny but also has some deep drama."
6281,"Just sit back and enjoy some great explosions, fighting scenes and snappy comic remarks. His tough guy facials are hilarious. And the "" The Marine "" is chock full of moments like those. The world was given some of the greatest action entertainments ever (Terminator's 1 and 2, Die Hard, Predator, Robocop etc). WWE champion John Cena makes his acting debut in WWE Films' "" The Marine ""."
6282,"At the bottom, maybe the best introduction to Houellebecque's world. Touching, embarrassing, forceful and unforgettable, many scenes depicting the pathos of their existence are simply unforgettable. Second, because of a certain frankness and urgency that Houellebecq brought to this work (his subsequent books became more and more formulaic, right down to the unaccepatable "" Platform ""). The intelligent script, screenplay and skillful acting allow the viewer a seamless transition between the lives of the two men. That's very welcome because Houellebecque is notorious for his polemical discussions, something that would be very hard to fit on a movie or entertainment television."
6283,"Good job by director Jafar Panahi. The director says "" The places are real, the event is real, and so are the characters and the extras. Am already hooked with Iranian movies and this one is a must - see! The scenes of celebration at the end of the film were real and spontaneous, which gave the film a real authenticity. Like any Panahi film, it was a very realistic drama depicting the common thread of social inequity and hypocrisy."
6145,"These are the scenes that truly shine. For what it is, this movie rocks! That's an honor on the level of being the best player on the Houston Texans. The procession of events may have been slightly predictable at times, but the characters remained real and believable throughout. The time line is fairly stable and simple to follow--except parts of the end--which makes for an enjoyable experience."
6284,"The performances for the most part are remarkable. The dish proves a pleasant diversion, with crisp performances and a tasty centre. The movie has a bright, intense, clear visual style, sometimes making use of extreme close - ups. It is one of this year's great movies. This should win many many many accolades for 2006, it's a rare stand out."
6285,"A truly outstanding film is able to evokes a plethora of emotions. Putting Nancy's trauma with Jyono's support seem to give a balanced picture of the situation. Their character is inspiring--their pain is as raw as anything you will ever see on film. The victims and their families rage with intense, fresh pain despite the decades. How Jyono's family turns from support to anger is touchingly portrayed."
6286,"At any rate, the action scenes were well - done and very realistic looking. In other words, this looks nice and, for the most part, is adequately acted even though amateurs do the acting. He's worked with the amazing NFL films as well as Friday Night Lights and many others. And that skinny kid manages to kick his first darn field goal right when it really matters! The message was awesome and what was more amazing were the non-paid "" servants "" that starred in this film."
6287,"Macavoy's character is so real. Overall this is a simply astonishing film, telling an important story with some great performances. This time he nails a range from fearful to seductive to terrifying, connecting them with a seamlessly explosive energy. Somehow Mr. Whitaker captures the madness and charm of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. Go ahead and hide your eyes during the "" tough "" scenes."
6288,"There are interviews with high - ranking former government and FBI agents. Leaf and Scheinfeld handle it nicely, and deal with it in under five minutes, but it really seems tacked on. Lennon's sincerity, his naivetÃ©, his charisma shine throughout. Thanks to Yoko Ono, Leaf and Scheinfeld had unlimited access to the Lennon archives. Directors Leaf and Scheinfeld are past masters at making serious pop culture retrospectives."
6289,"A great movie, one which should become a cult classic (only because it might be a bit too "" graphic "" for mainstream cinemas, but certainly a classic. What everyone will hear about "" Shortbus "" is that the sex is real and explicit. The trick to slice - of - life movies is to make the ordinary extraordinary. The superb cast of characters of John Cameron Mitchell's "" Shortbus "" powerfully draws the viewer in to each of the characters' lives and problems. It's wonderful and refreshing and ground - breaking and the bravest film in years."
6290,"Great performances and ever better plot. The script, acting, settings, props, everything was so well - done. Add Andy Serkis to the mix, and what is assembled is a group of performers who know how to fully engage the audience. The Prestige is a masterful exercise in storytelling with superb direction and powerful performances by a grand ensemble cast. There are deeper layers of this film that will be uncovered over time."
6293,"Black comedy cut from the same cloth as the Todd Solondz movies "" Happiness "" and "" Storytelling "". Yes, it challenges society's mores, but in a sweet and very funny way. It deals with love fidelity, and the value and pitfalls of secrets and honesty. The dilemmas are reflected into other relationships. A lot of them made millions and got away with it."
6294,"The performances in the film are strong. Overall this is a great film, filled with amazing performances, no one should miss. Nevertheless, the characters are all absorbing, especially the young versions of Robert Downey Jr, Eric Roberts and Rosario Dawson. Special mention to Chazz Palminteri, who always has a strong but unforced screen presence. Downey, Jr. has been making a strong comeback for his career and when he pulls in outstanding performances like this it reestablishes his talent."
6295,"By carefully placing events from the past in a certain order, and by introducing important sequences of the character's lives, Saw 3 manages to become a pivotal point to the series. Very similar to Saw II, Saw III had multiple "" games "" being carried on at once. The traps were clever, original, and far, far deadlier this time around. But any episode in a good series should be able to stand on it's own without _ needing _ the prior episodes to work. Like the 2 movies before it, difficult decisions and some nasty secrets become a part of a much larger plan."
6506,"The set action pieces are excitingly crafted with excellent sound effects and design going into overdrive. It's more the backgrounds, the world itself, and the sort of mock stedicam moving shots that are so striking. Treasure Town is a gloriously colourful island sitting sedately in the centre of a river yet its buildings and inhabitants for all their grandeur seem incredibly outdated. This anime is amazing purely for its story and visual look. some of the animation is breathtakingly beautiful, although the faces of the characters lack a certain expressivity."
6297,"Chicken Run had great reviews as well. The performances are spot on and everyone is obviously having a tongue in cheek good time. It has excellent writing, the animation is absolutely top notch, and the voice talent live up to their high dollar reputations. The level of detail is amazing and it's going to take many viewings and many hours with the DVD on pause to spot them all. In Flushed Away, Aardman studios has made yet another family classic that will still be as entertaining ten years from now as it is today."
6298,"The sceneries and costumes look great. The actors, especially Whishaw who plays Grenouille, have done a very good job. Tom Tykwer beautifully achieves to always put the audience in the right mood, with the help of an amazing soundtrack and great camera work. all roles are perfectly cast, the music, the camera, everything fits together like a perfect jigsaw puzzle. Although much of the story is told by a narrative voice (mostly quotes from the novel), the movie is still thrilling and exciting all the way."
6299,"The only funny stuff in this movie was the bloopers. But if you liked the other movies, go see this one; it's not as action packed, it's a little sappy, but it's clean fun and you'll laugh if you let yourself! Tim Allen was perfect as Santa and Mrs. Santa is lovely. Took the kids to see this and they loved it. The movie gets the majority of its laughs from the emoting Short, the skeptical Arkin, and the sight gags like the yawning "" Santa Fireplace ""."
6300,"At the same time, Kopple and Peck capture the personalities and heart that are at the center of the band and their music. Like the music that envelopes it, this film was worth the wait. Hopefully this will open some people's eyes. This incredible true story mixes glamor, humor, great music and current events in a way that lets the facts speak for themselves. Whether you agree with what they said or not, it is an American value to speak your mind, and a greater American value to defend the rights of others who speak their minds as well."
6301,"Insecurities, foibles - and just a few quirks - are in full display. It is a brave, and ultimately, a rewarding choice for a director who has built his impeccable reputation on the strength of his mockumentaries. The ET / Charlie Rose / Ebert & Roeper spoofs were hilarious and dead - on. John Michael Higgins does a very funny William H. Macy - like character. And the doe - eyed and endlessly endearing Christopher Moynihan tosses off several absolute gems in response to the inanity going on around him."
6490,"Unlike others, this one offers you a different vantage point. The Scream series made fun of the horror film in general, this movie pretended the killers in those films were real and makes fun of how stupid victims can be and how predictable the sequences are in a slasher situation. This is what the horror genre needs, people who make fun camp movies. He's like Jim Carrey with a sharp implement fetish. There have been very similar movies made in this vein, such as MAN BITES DOG and in some respects THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, but the best and most effective examples of this sub-genre have always come from overseas."
6475,"There is also o beautiful tree, shortly passing buy in the hand of an ex-student of Manescu, now working outside the country. There are moments when you laugh. Most Romanians (and East - Europeans alike) will understand it very well, since many clichÃ©s are present here: the vain, non-professional media, the desolate streets, the people without perspectives or hope, the arrogant new - rich former secret service people, the successful immigrants coming from even lesser parts of the world. Even thought there is almost no evident action, except for the long television broadcast of an obnoxious talk show - even some apparently loose ends or inconclusive stories - the fact is you can ponder on days on this beautiful work of art. And that humor is shown in spades in this film."
6304,"Cambell's direction is very good; the writing is crisp; production values are very high; the photography is stunning. From the black and white pre-titles, to arguably the best titles sequence ever. This is among the best bond movies! From the African free - running chase to the beautiful interiors of London. However, great directing and performances from everyone involved, along with Phil Meheux's excellent cinematography, Peter Lamont's as ever superb production design and all the other top - notch craft and technical departments make' Casino Royale' a classy and very enjoyable night out at the movies."
6305,"The audience in general obviously loved it judging by the laughter but by the enthralled silence at the dramatic parts. The way it's made is incredibly cinematic, and, at its heart, tells a great mythic story: an outcast leaves his community and journeys to the edge of the world to find a way to end the famine that's plaguing his species. The character voices from Robin Williams, Elijah Wood, Hugh Jackman, and others was perfectly matched to their characterizations. Some of the scenes are beautifully imagined, including attacks by sea lions (quite harrowing, actually, until its denouement), vultures, and killer whales, not to mention every time Mumble and / or his posse leap off a cliff and slide down the side like avian sleds. The little ones just thought the penguins were cute and the chase scenes etc were thrilling."
6306,"Anything that is seen either in the past, present, or future has a reason for being there and will be intelligently explained. For sheer entertainment and an intriguing (though not flawless) plot, Bruckheimer, Scott and Co. sure have DELIVERED the goods. The motion trails and speed scans lend a stylized digital editing program feel and are gorgeous to watch. And all the footage that involves a cast of thousands (meaning the crowd scenes) is masterful work. Also, the performances are stellar, Denzel and Kilmer as well as a quietly maniacal Jim Caviezel and the emotionally exasperated Paula Patton, and the visuals unique."
6307,"Like in all great ensemble movies, "" Bobby "" offers a stellar cast, none of whom disappoint. And what works for this type of film - making is the amount of anticipation it builds up, and even after pivotal scenes, the impact it leaves on the audience. Emilio Estevez writes, directs, and co-stars; he has truly elevated his level of direction and writing. The subtle colorful hues reflect the emotional grip of each scene, and extenuate a modern feel to the film. This film is a series of vignettes of the lives of many people (22 examples shine) whose hope for a better future than that of a country undergoing disintegration on many levels were shattered."
6308,"Just keep those moments in your mind as grateful and nice memories. It shows how a positive attitude can change anything. And heck, sometimes, it's worth the price of admission to vicariously live them , 82 minutes at a time. ( Aided beautifully by Phedon Papamichael's cinema verity style camera work . ) It is well worth viewing, and this is a DVD that has featurettes that are touching, informative, and comic - a pleasure to view."
6309,"There is an overall honesty to the performances. Kate Winslet's character is another that was well worked out. Excellent production values keep the rather trite story flowing. Cue enormous L. A. mansion with swimming pool (just the way Brits imagine it). Charismatic and entertaining, unless you find Diaz, Law or Winslet personally irritating (some people do), they are a joy to watch, filling their parts with love and light."
6474,"Canet always stays close, very close to his characters and their feelings, and his storyline / plot and gives the audience an excellent humanistic suspense Although Cluzet carries the movie, the rest of the cast, which contains a number of very distinguished French actors, is first - rate. Guillaume Canet's thriller opens on one of those naturalistic dinner party scenes: all glasses clinking and laughter and dialogue just a pitch below hearing. The stakes get higher and higher as the plot unfolds. Canet respected very well Coben's work and the cast is absolutely excellent!"
6311,"Although some scenes are entirely bizarre and unfitting, they were fun to watch and enjoyable. So much over-the-top fun and the songs are so catchy. In the end, Tenacious D are probably best enjoyed in half hour episodes, but fans of the show will find much to enjoy here. The movie is hilarious and delivers non-stop laughs. The soundtrack is great, the laughs are plentiful, and the storyline is simple, entertaining, yet complex."
6312,"No hidden messages, nothing cryptic, just a great entertainer. Just realize that there are still things to be enjoyed without doing a critical acclamation and you should be fine! Much of their work previously ignored, hopefully this film will elevate them to greater things and Oscars are surely looming. There is also Sadie a member of Taj's frat, whom one could say has an ample bussom that is played for laughs. If only the respected film institutions representing and honouring Western cinema appreciated such inspiring and ground - breaking work."
6313,"Good production values, great soundtrack and a somewhat believable story. It also had a lot of shocking parts u would not expect. The film did a good job of setting their tones, they did a good job at pacing and they managed to do a good job with the intensity. ' Turistas' was a fun horror flick with a' Hostel' like plot. It had an OK script, OK actors, cool scenes, a fun plot, and gruesome gore."
6314,"The accounts of atrocities are shockingly real. As remarkable as the soulful Djimon Hounsou who manages to give the film a visible soul. Very mainstream and formulaic, but it is raised up quite a bit by DiCaprio's character and his terrific realization of it. Djimon Hounsou is perfectly cast and is more - than - believable when he wields a shovel. Every few years an action movie comes along that has amazing depth."
6315,"Steve Buscemi is perfect as Templeton. Children and adults will enjoy this film. If you want high drama this year, go see Apocalypto, or Blood Diamond. Talking animals and spiders, so realistic the kids don't even blink twice. And this movie gets a huge boost through its A-list voice talents, with the likes of, check this out - Julia Roberts as Charlotte, Steve Buscemi as Templeton the selfish rat, John Cleese as Sam Sheep, leader of the pack of sheep followers (played to hilarity), Katy Bates, Cedric the Entertainer, Oprah Winfrey, Robert Redford, Thomas Haden Church, Andre Benjamin and Sam Shepard."
6316,"Get better actors and get a better director and you will have something. The CG on Saphira was very well done. The special effects and overall look of the film is passable, not a multi-million dollar SFX laden film, but believable in its visuals. But those are two experienced actors that will give good performances regardless. The acting by Rachel Weisz was fantastic."
6317,This movie was written and presented the way Mr. Stallone wanted. The movie is inspiring --- the winning quality in all Rocky movies. It's slow in certain areas particularly at the beginning but over all a nostalgic effort which tried to capture the theme of the earlier rocky movies. For those of you who have written off Sylvester Stallone as an actor - you are in for a re-awakening of his talent. The question in this movie is actually more like a Rocky Marciano v's Ali now than it was in the 70's!
6319,"Beautiful scenery and costumes, a cast of thousands, and enough background information to make you feel you are more educated about a time and place than you were before you saw the movie. all signs of a terrific writer. Most incredible of all were the zoom shots onto a particular character's face or eyes, emphasizing the sweat on his / her brow or a particularly telling expression on his / her face. What this film offers the fortunate viewer that many other movies of its kind do not, are lead characters you can actually empathize with and grow to care about. The story is so realistic that it makes one wonder if it isn't based in fact rather than fiction, and the feelings of the time (hatred for imperialistic foreigners) is documented accurately."
6321,"Compare this movie to masterpieces like "" Lawrence of Arabia "" or "" The Searchers . "" Aside from length, everything else about the film is on the plus side--the handsome cinematography, the vast amount of settings, the background score that adds to the drama, and the performances of the entire cast which are uniformly good. This, as well as a depiction of the result of Wilson's decision, are just two of the moments of brilliance in The Good Shepherd. ALEC BALDWIN has little to do but is intense enough as one of the agency's top men and others in the cast maintain credibility all the way through. The final twenty minutes comprise "" The Good Shepherd ""'s emotional and thematic backbone."
6322,"Yes there are great performances here. It moves at a rapturous pace that leaves you breathless and delivers performances that are both subtle and fittingly over the top. During the first 45 - 60 minutes of this all the music takes place as realistic performance. Not to mention her stunning beauty, as each costume and scene in which she appears seem to top one another in terms of showcasing her incredible beauty. The movie is artfully rendered and exquisitely produced in literally every area with outstanding, heartfelt performances by each and every cast member."
6143,"Lawrence Fishborne did a wonderful job with this film. Laurence Fishburne is great as Larabee, delivering one of his finest performances to date. It is undoubtedly a fascinating subject to behold, one which requires large amounts of both intelligence and strategy. But as the months pass, her bond with Larabee grows along with her ambition. Like Rudy (1993), Akeelah and the Bee is most certainly original in that the story is plausible, meaningful, and very emotional."
6325,"Spike Lee has made his most powerful work yet with "" When The Levees Broke "". The purity of the depiction is very refreshing, free of the overbearingly pompous moral platitudes of someone like Michael Moore. It is always compulsive viewing, and while the subject matter is impossibly dark, it does show some wonderful flashes of human strength and positivity that provide some hope. When a Government that is responsible for it's people turns it back on an entire State for immoral reasons someone needs to be accountable. Thank you Spike and all the people at 40 Acres and a Mule for doing what had to be done - recording the real story."
6326,"Her range and ability to work consistently over so many years and under the conditions of this film is mind blowing. See Lynch's "" Rabbits "" episodes first, separately, ideally a week or so ahead. His freedom in making this movie, both with medium and artistic control, is unparalleled in anything he's done. It's everything he has ever wanted to put into a film and it's completely free from anyone else's taming influence. It's full of Angelo Badalamenti's dark work and there's a couple of great songs in there as well."
6327,"There is also plenty of suspense here to keep film viewers attentive. The boys are dissimilar types but all are energized as only high spirited adolescents can be. Among the students there is Posner's dawning, hesitant realization of his queer impulses, and Dakin's more confident and polymorphous sexual appetites. His screenplay sparkles with laser - like little zingers. One of these reasons is that it is driven by extremely eloquent conversations between younger and elder intellectuals, each conversation delving aggressively deep into the corners of conventional logic and subtexts and fleshing them out in what different characters arguably believe are the most truthful ways."
6328,"This is a gripping film that moves crisply from one scene to the next, missing only a very few beats along the way. Great performances all round, with special mention to Bill Nighy in the Bill Nighy role. At a tidy 92 minutes, "" Notes on a Scandal "" is highly concentrated and vivid. Every film should aspire to be as satisfying as this one is - on every level, and there are so many layers to it all. There are giftedly handled, extraordinarily candid scenes of rage, humiliation and disgrace, and cruel physical and emotional clashes of immense force."
6329,"and HUGE battles - but all done with an intensity that's stunning. Whether you see dozens of servants getting up in the morning, or preparing food, or planting flowers, it all occurs in such a fiercely coordinated fashion. And even more, the acting was superb - Chow Yung Fat is a master, and his scenes together with Gong Li are beautifully emotional. While emotional scenes with Gong Li drew some laughter from the audience, his final scene was noteworthy and articulation has improved. "" Curse of the Golden Flower "" is probably the most lavish costume drama in history, equaling or outdoing director Zhang Yimou's other spectaculars, such as "" Hero "" and "" House of Flying Daggers . """
6330,"Everything is neat, pleasant - well, just nice. Everything is ordered and everyone seems to be satisfied living this kind of life. What makes this film so important and good is the remarkable similarity to life in many large cities or even countries nowadays. The strong difference between Andreas and the others leads to very amusing situations as well. The attractive plot is perfectly supported by a smart direction where every single component (cool desaturated photography; cold symmetrical design; unemotional acting; slow, highly controlled camera movements) helps in building an unique weird atmosphere that will keep the audience suspended until the end."
6331,"It was so rich, with so many textures. Some of the revelations in the plot were really sophisticated. Cate Blanchett is perfect as the femme fatale. The film's strongest asset is Cate Blanchett, who channels Marlene Dietrich. Blanchett and Clooney lead a strong cast and make a better film than expected from the novel's source material."
6332,"Many people are wondering whether this will be able to compete for Best Picture at the Oscars this year. It was worth it for producer / director Clint Eastwood to tackle on a second part to his now two - part duo of Iwo Jima movies. The letter is full of words that truly come from the heart of this kid's mother, and by the time the general finishes reading the letter, every soldier in that cave has realized that Americans aren't these savages; these hate - driven murderers. Eastwood has really outdone himself this time, at the age of 76 years he has created one of the best (if not the best) war films in history. Later during the trip, speaking with Japanese friends and seeing the Japanese news, stories of lost loved ones from the war were common and this movie for the Japanese people has brought many of these memories out in the open."
6333,"BUT, the flashback scenes were very well done! sense of humour, some very nice looking actresses in it! They're actually pretty delicate organs, easily punctured and drained. Otherwise, you'll find plenty of great slashers out there on the video shelf. Everything that made the original good was gone in this movie."
6369,"Among the supporting players, there are quite a familiar faces - Ileana Douglas as Vogue editor Diana Vreeland, Jimmy Fallon as Sedgwick's confidante Chuck Wein, Tara Summers as fellow Warhol protÃ©gÃ© Brigid Berlin, Mena Suvari as Brigid's sister Richie, Edward Herrmann as the family attorney, Mary Kate Olsen as a partygoer. The weakness of the film is best shown by the interviews over the closing credits. The cameras take you through a real life tragedy as Sienna Miller portrays a charming and naive Edie Sedgwick. With her big raccoon eyes, pre-punk hairdo and flashing smile, Miller bears such a striking resemblance to the real - life Sedgwick that she carries much of the film by the sheer will of her character's Holly Golightly - like sense of exalted self - worth. The film is overly choppy in attempting to find the right look and feel and yet with Jagger, Velvet Underground and the Dylanesque Hayden Christensen, the importance and power of music for this era is clearly established."
6334,"Production design (by Martin Childs), which incorporates a color palette that matches Potter's work, and cinematography by Andrew Dunn ("" History Boys, "" "" Mrs. Henderson "") are elegant but not ostentatious, and are reminiscent of the look of "" Finding Neverland, "" another film set in turn - of - the - century England. It has exquisite beauty, love, aspiration and dreams --- and meticulous historical vibes. It is superbly acted all round, and makes brilliant use of the locations really allowing the viewer to understand and appreciate the beauty of the Lake District. It is extremely rare in these days of overblown special effects and "" Written by Number Scripts "" to come across a film that has intelligence, innocence, excellent acting, and beautiful music and cinematography. Very high recommendations for this movie and its talented actors."
6335,"There has been some nice creative input behind the making of the world of Minimoys. Overall ,' Arthur et les Minimoys' is a cute little fun film. ' Arthur et les Minimoys' is a charming little children's adventure film. The violence was minimal and well - handled (vague battle scenes), the scary parts not over-the-top scary, and the light touch with the romance was appreciated by the mom of a pre-pre-teen. Beautiful artwork, wonderful voices for the animated characters by David Bowie, Madonna, Jimmy Fallon, Robert DeNiro, and Ron Crawford."
6336,"It stands on its own and really, the only tie in is the Stiffler name. Eric's girlfriend then has second thoughts, fearing that this guilt free trip will eventually lead up to their break - up. Eugene Levy is all thats left from the original cast but he does a good job, in an Axl Rose minus Slash, Duff, Matt, and Izzy kinda way. While the original Pie films felt like a smart homage to the sex romps of the 80s (Porky's, Revenge of the Nerds, etc), this one just felt like a retread of the lame straight - to - video sex comedies of the early 90s (Ski School 2, Meatballs 4, etc). It was great listening to him tell cousin Stiffler that he was at the school hanging out, because he's an alumni."
6338,"The colors are rich, the camera is precise, the sounds are finely recorded. This is good film - making, but it seems almost at cross purposes with itself. After college, the majority in both films had gone on to exceptional careers. That people's values, aims and lifestyles can change. A simple and subtle difference in tune with this simple and subtle film where the small touches and gentle silences speak more than any plotting or dialog."
6339,"But after a while these characters became very likable. There is a certain authentic touch he gives these characters that makes the film all the more real and believable. The characters, for the most part, aren't likable, but very realistic and well - played. Nick Cassavetes has created such a true - to - life depiction of what happened, that it's almost frightening. In his every moment on screen, the charismatic Timberlake brings an intensity, shrewdness and liveliness to his performance that bodes well for his future career in movies."
6141,"Bruce Willis, Sir Ben Kingsley, Morgan Freeman, Lucy Liu, Stanley Tucci and Josh Hartnett fill a cast line up every bit as impressive as say, Sin City. The dialogue tries relentlessly to be witty, to varying degrees of success. Slevin, The Rabbi, The Boss and Goodkat all stand out, and Hartnett, Kingsley, Freeman and Willis all turn in commendable and charismatic performances. The rest of the cast including Lucy Liu, Stanley Tucci, and Bruce Willis as a hit - man are solid as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. It was great to see Josh Hartnet get a good interesting role for a change."
6350,"Olyphant plays sleazy well - just watch him in the otherwise - forgettable "" The Girl Next Door "" (2004). Despite Grant's admirable attempt to spin the romantic comedy's meet - cute moment, it's hard to believe Gray would fall for a chap who, for the lack of a better phrase, finds carnal comfort at the most unlikely occasions. Jennifer Garner is perfectly cast as Grey, a woman who loose her fiancÃ© just days before the wedding. She has a smile that melts the hardest heart and although "" Catch and Release "" can never shake its conventions, whenever the film entertains, it's mostly because of Garner. It's polished, looks good; a cut above, say, the odd independent romcoms that tackle the trials and tribulations, the angst and adoration among a group of good friends."
6341,"It seems incredible, but' Susanne Bier' (qv) can apparently overdo herself every time! Particularly' Rolf LassgÃ¥rd' (qv) does a fabulous job. Jacob in the power of his convictions, Jorgen in the power of money and commerce. It is at this point that the film takes some dramatic turns and through a series of unexpected events, a few skeletons in closets, the past and emotive performances, becomes a really deep and moving piece of cinema. Ms. Knudsen turns in a nuanced and satisfying performance that is a pleasure to watch."
6472,"In years in which seems that vulgarity is the better way to make laugh, this is a masterpiece. You will go through a whole range of emotions as you watch this film, laughter, shock, sadness. He understands the intimacy of friendships and knows how to draw superlative performances from his actors - an obvious extension of the concept of friendship! No prizes for guessing how it all works out, but it's nicely played, with Auteuil's grimly smiling desperation offset nicely by Boon's sheer sad sack likability. Though it can be considered a' comedy' in the French tradition, it is also a fine examination of the importance of friendship in a world too cluttered with' acquaintances' passing as friends."
6139,"The characters are well fleshed out (which is amazing for most recent movies) and Antonio Banderas gets to be his uber - suave, ultra-rich self. This is rather more fun and effective drama powered by fantastic dance sequences, with the aid of Benderas who leads the kids. But the really significant aspect of this movie is the realistic portrayal of the lives of the high school students. There are plenty of funny parts, as well as enough drama and interesting character conflicts to keep everything interesting. Meanwhile, the students that make up his class are relative unknowns, but all are fantastic dancers with acting skills to match."
6344,"Kenny is overflowing with tons of heartfelt humor. You find yourself jumping in your seat at his successes. The characters are genuine, the story is charming and the artistic vision is strong. You make them with good scripts and talented actors etc. . Whether you've heard any of his hilarious expressions before or not, they will still be adorably funny."
6466,"Natassia Malthe, Sarah Carter and Rhona Mitra are some beautiful women. The cinematography is good and gives the movie nice a look especially in the night scenes. The chase scenes and guns are superb. The Idea in intself still is pretty cool, it just wasn't done very well. Thats right the fight scenes weren't even good!"
6137,"His pacing is relaxed, but doesn't drag; although there are a few longueurs, most scenes unfold at just the right pace, and there are several great set - pieces. Das Leben der Anderen is an outstanding movie, probably a great one. Ulrich Muhe as the Stasi Officer was brilliant. And even though the movie has very tough moments it is all so well done and presented with such a good taste that in the end you feel some sort of relieved. Germany has produced some very good movies recently."
6347,"Focus and concentration on your goals helps - yes. People are responsible for whatever problems they suffer. It's slick, over-produced, and will turn - off any sensible, intelligent person looking for an honest eye - opener. This documentary encourages people to change their lives in a positive way. Here it is in a nutshell: The movie first suckers the simple - minded into believing it has some validity by first presenting the revolutionary concept that boils down to "" a positive outlook on life makes you more pleasant and makes you experience your day better ""."
6351,"Plus some fine touches of grim humor, and a dash of eye candy. Though the final plot twist is prepared for and makes as much sense as anything else in the film, still it feels flat and unsatisfying. He nails the character, both megalomaniacal and insecure. The camera trains on his eyes and Piven somehow builds a universe of frailty inside. Performances are not bad given all these things but none of the characters are particularly likable for any reason."
6134,"He does the role justice, and fills the shoes of the protagonist very well. This is accentuated by very strong performances by all the actors. The Hills Have Eyes is a movie that knows exactly what it needs to do to satisfy its target audience, and it does it well. Strictly talking in terms of cinema, "" The Hills Have Eyes "" is also a more than decent production. Better acting, better visual effects, better make - up, better story presentation (i. e. no unanswered plot holes or abrupt "" halts ""), and much, MUCH more gore."
6132,"This film is probably not a classic or will be fondly remembered in five years but for the audience it is aimed at it succeeds on many levels. thought a lot of any three of these actresses until now - but it was very good. Both Emma Roberts and Jojo are newcomers to the screen and do a surprisingly good job at playing bubbly girls without making the audience want to wring their necks 10 minutes in and though each have yet to develop their skills especially at showing a wide range of emotions, they certainly are charming and enjoyable to watch. In contrast to Hilary Duff and Lindsey Lohan, she may be one of the few teenage actresses who has a great prospect for an acting future. The endings are very sweet and aquamarine is just so funny cause she doesn't know much about boys and life on the surface."
6130,"With Inside Man, Lee showcases an interesting way of directing thrillers. The good parts of the film involve the interactions between Washington and Owen. Denzel Washington is good as always as Det. Keith Frazier. The dialogue is sharp, with the conversations between Frazier and Russell being especially fascinating, and both actors are at the top of their game in this new movie. Her existence is amusing in that it reveals a bit about what Spike Lee thinks the corridors of white power are like."
6129,"She truly lit up the screen in her 5 minutes. The supporting performances were nice here to from Peter Dinklage and Alex Rocco. The overall acting is really good, Linus Roache shines in his role as prosecutor Kierney. Creativity in movies at its best. Still, Lumet captures this ensemble with enough nuance and well - spun, real dialog, for two movies."
6356,"Highly recommended, on several different levels. Even as a comedy, the film works on several levels. As an added fillip, Danish fans can play' Lookey', to find hidden visual elements out of context in the movie and first winner gets to be an extra in the next film. Von Trier has also devised a new ascetic aesthetic to' rediscover his original enthusiasm for film . ' Ever the creator of some new cinematic technique, von Trier has committed the movie's cinematography to a (published) mathematical formula and principle called' Automavision'."
6357,"Life was good in Miami in the 70s. Cocaine Cowboys is a great movie. A lot of what's related here ends up putting anything fictional you may have seen in the shade. This was what happened to Miami with cocaine in the late 1970s and early 1980s, a story told exhilaratingly in Billy Corbern's fast - moving documentary' Cocaine Cowboys'. The sequel, Cocaine Cowboys 2 - Hustlin With The Godmother, is going to be even better."
6124,"A strong production for Twentieth Century Fox. Still, it's one of the better sequels there is, and it's a cool way to start the summer (in this side of the world, that is). Leary's Diego is not the showiest turn, but he also has some great moments. The characters are all lovable and there are a few extremely funny parts in it! This film is a throwback to what made classics such as "" The Little Mermaid "" and "" Beauty and The Beast "" work: solid acting and a good writing base."
6359,"The movie was in fact serious (with some great laughs on the aside) and yet it still worked. It's humorous, it's engaging, and in general a real feel - good movie, with solid performances by everyone including the child - actors. The timeless truths are all the more poignant set against the backdrop of such an impossible dream. Billy Bob and Virginia Madsen do terrific jobs with their characters. All of the other members of the well - casted supporting ensemble (including some young members of the Polish tribe) delivered solid performances as well."
6360,"Samaire Armstrong and Kevin Zegers show a great chemistry and have excellent performances. Armstrong and Zegers have a cute chemistry and their individual performances were delightful. Armstrong and Zegers, as well as all the supporting actors and actresses, look like they have a fun time giving pleasant and congenial performances. Samaire Armstrong is especially good as "" Woody, "" walking and moving and acting "" like a guy "" and Kevin Zegers is good also but his characterization is more understated. But what this one had, was plenty of heart, pounding on the universal theme of empathy, of not being able to fully understand someone, until you get under their skin and walk around in it, in which case this movie of course took things literally."
6123,"The rest of the cast, especially the character of Kit, are perfect for the parts played and extremely funny. Great characters, great story, and loads of bust out laughing situations. Her facial expressions and deep voice were perfect for the quirky character she played. It was possibly the funniest movie so far this year. While the chemistry between the leads was lacking spark, their performances were still fun to watch."
6122,"It takes some unexpected turns and has a great ending. Someone is still able to shoot truly remarkable movies. Great camera angles that create more suspense help you really understand what they are going through. It can be corny and predictable at times, but 16 Blocks is a good flick and you should see it. but the characters and their behavior is so real, full of senses and inside thoughts that their acting touches the very soul!"
6121,"the rest of the cast with the exception of Ziagler give somewhat good performances. There are certainly some very effective scenes in the film that will raise the hairs on a few necks. Sure there are advantages to Hollywood - ification; take a look at the difference in special effects for' The Ring' and' The Grudge'. It's one of those horror movies with eerie sets and shots. The movie that inspired this one ,' Kairo' (aka' Pulse'), had a very complex plot line with real suspense, real attachment of audience feeling, and real take - home messages."
6120,"Mean Girls and Freaky Friday) Lindsay Lohan is very charming. But if one digs the premise and is a Lohan fan, they could do worse then to check this whimsical little flick out. Lindsay Lohan is charming and adorable as usual and shows a good chemistry with Chris Pine making this movie work. In Manhattan, Ashley Albright (Lindsay Lohan) is a lucky woman and very successful in the agency where she works. Further, the story has no villain and all the characters are nice."
6119,"In fact, a lot of this movie can be defined as set - pieces more so than a single flowing experience. at least Milla looks good in her outfits, and the outfits are cool. They bark with cute little "" yip yips! "" Another big strength of the movie is the very cool concepts. To be fair, Milla Jovovich has an incredible face and body and is well - suited for fight scenes."
6367,"The character and set designs were just right, the casting of the supporting characters (even Justin Timberlake and especially Kim Richards) was spot on. as he has transformed himself into a very believable Mid-South blues man. Lazarus and Rae (Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci respectively) have a great chemistry and a great respect for each other. get past "" Snakes on a Plane "" and see how mercuricul Samuel L. Jackson is. Those of you with more delicate palates might experience a little discomfort watching this, and understandably so."
6368,"Tom Cavanaugh and Heather Graham have amazing chemistry. That's no denigration of the lead players - Heather Graham, Thomas Cavanaugh and Bridget Monahan - all of whom are appealing and likable in their various roles. Two perfect beauties, two usually miscast actors in roles that befit them, a rather original script. The references throughout the movie to the 40's were superb. She got such great performances out of her actors."
6127,"All of the acting and characterizations were fine and on target. His resemblance to Amanda Bynes is astonishing. The actors' comedic senses of timing were impeccable. She easily carries the film with no hesitations and makes it worth while. The greatest highlight of the movie of course is the star character Amanda Bynes, who is absolutely gorgeous and hilarious."
6373,"Prepon did an awesome job portraying Karla Holumka. The only major difference between Karla and Laura is that Homolka was a very small woman - 5' 2 or so, while Laura is very tall , 5' 11. She is not a sympathetic character, and Prepon delivers a believable performance. Disorder is accurately diagnosed by her psychiatrist, well - portrayed by veteran actor Patrick Bauchau. Whether this film is true to the actual crimes or not, at the very least it presents a powerful impression of Karla's side of the story."
6118,"The action scenes were in your face and looked pretty damn realistic. A great cast, beginning with Paul Walker and Vera Farmiga. Walker is surprisingly impressive considering the strictly one - dimensional roles he played in movies such as The Fast And The Furious and Into The Blue. But where this film lacks the dialog of a Tarantino film, it is a lot more visually stylish than anything QT has ever done. Unbearably tense, visually inventive and superbly acted from start to finish, Running Scared is the first real surprise of 2006 - it pulls no punches and thrills from its excessively bloody opening to its foul - mouthed conclusion."
6378,"Both scenes are so powerful you will be moved very much. His versatile and grown - up performance glues the ensemble and the story strands together. Juliette Binonche, a french actor with a wide range of persona skills depict the sense of solemness to a high degree. The characters journeys come to a conclusion which fits the theme of redemption and moving beyond the past. As Will grows closer to Amira, he begins to pull away from Liv."
6379,"However, the performances are quite good, some bordering on excellence. There is a love interest Barbara, played by the quite attractive and dynamic Romola Garai, who keeps Mr. Fantastic. Ioan Gruffudd, the young Welchman best known for his excellent portrayal of C. S. Forester's seafaring hero, Horatio Hornblower, in eight made - for - A&E movies (1998 - 2003), brings great depth and passion to his portrayal of this complex hero of social justice. Though this is small compared to most major movies, it is a pretty good amount for a smaller movie like this. The most charming parts were fodder provided by the fabulous screen writing and brought to electric life by Ioan Gruffudd as impassioned Wilberforce, Benedict Cumberpatch as driven and farseeing William Pitt, P. M., Romola Garai as Wilberforce's zesty and feisty wife Barbara and the surprisingly fantastic delivery by Jeremy Swift as Ioan's long - suffering wise butler."
6117,"That in itself is something of an achievement. The toilet humor (literally) was simply retarded, and a few jokes almost worked. The rare laughs were part genuine enjoyment and part trying to make the best of a horrible situation. Random scenes pop up, trying to get a laugh by basically reenacting the scene, not exaggerating it or making fun of it. The concept was great, and "" date movies "" are ripe for being made fun of."
6116,"Firstly, right away you get glimpes of STUNNING scenery that continue throughout the whole film. This is an awesome movie for all ages. The movie also is really able to give anyone an idea of what its like to be in the artic, and really gave a clear picture of what being an explorer was like. The movie can be seen and enjoyed by all ages. By all means take the kids and enjoy."
6382,"The scenes are absolutely beautiful, every one of them. From the very first moment, you can see the fantastic colors and the amazing visuals. And all these fantastic close - ups just made these scenes perfect! Every detail, every background, every special effect set to the scenes are so mindblowingly stunning. These scenes were incredibly beautifully choreographed."
6115,"This was a major factor in the film's success: at peak moments the ensemble works up to an incredible momentum and texture. Stage backdrops in lovely colors - muted yellows and ochres â€“ enhance the visual effects. The accompanying musical group and their arrangements are all marvelous. Just close your eyes and go back in time. The editing, by Andy Keir ("" Mandela, "" Beloved, "" "" The Secret Lives of Dentists, "" "" Off the Map "") is just as it should be for a musical performance film: not a single song is interrupted even once."
6384,"Directed by Pierre Salvadori, Pricess is one heck of a delightful gem. Audrey Tautou is really great in this film. Her range of facial expressions alone is joyful to watch. That having said, loved Audrey Tatou's acting - AS ALWAYS. Gad Elmaleh delivers a similar performance as he did in the valet, which works perfectly for this movie, luckily."
6385,"all these were well expressed in the hand of Joonho Bong, director. Hiebong Byeon's play was impressive. It wraps everything up incredibly neatly, with each character having had their shot at redemption. It's great entertainment with some brilliant moments of shock and terror. All managing the frequent dips into serious and comical and even both at the same time."
6113,"5 out of 10 Remember folks, it's well done! The house is beautifully designed, all dark wood and glassy reflections, and there are a few moments that are of visual interest. The best way to describe it is to compare it to Hitchcock movies. The performances are routine, dark hallways replace genuine horror, and the scares are of the tired cat - in - the - closet variety. She babysits in a real nice house packed full of gadgets in a remote location."
6111,"Performances in the film are convincing. There is an element that seems realistic and that is the acceptable number of henchmen who are employed by the leader. Seeing Harrsion Ford in the cast of a movie typically guarantees at least a minimum standard of quality. If you're looking for a simple pseudo-thriller that follows the typical script, you'll enjoy this. The fist fight choreography can get pretty intense, however, there's no need to reach the end of the road before you know who's gonna emerge tops."
6388,"Although, Tabu is a well known Bollywood star, her acting in this movie bears little semblance to Bollywood - ish pretension. Surprisingly, contrary to expectations, Americans at the Namesake showing far outnumbered their Indian counterparts. Hurry and watch this in the cinemas before its run is up. This film is everything a good movie is supposed to be: diverting and credible. Instead what you get is raw emotion, real struggles and a frightfully original storyline."
6110,"Thoroughly enjoyable, worth seeing, & nothing in it to offend anyone of any age. It is a visually stunning rendering of the classic children's books. Will Ferrell was great as the The Man In The Yellow Hat, his voice had a very friendly feel to it. For a full - length animated feature that was under a tremendous production schedule (not counting the 14 + years of development), Imagine Entertainment really pulled it together quite well. A children's animated movie the is completely and totally suitable for children of all ages."
6108,"Martin's Clouseau fits this mold. The beauty of the Sellers "" Clouseau "" was the subtlety that Sellers brought to the character. Think original Clouseau + The Jerk and you get the idea. In the same way, Steve Martin's Inspector Jacques Clouseau is a totally new creation, as uniquely Martin's as the original was uniquely Sellers'. Steve Martin shines as Inspector Clouseau, nailing the ridiculous accent perfectly."
6104,"Anyone that is even considering seeing this go see it as soon as you can. This is a nice touch that keeps the viewer actively involved in the cinematic proceedings. If you have seen the 1st 2, the 3rd is a charm. Excellent scenes, excellent storyline, and new and unusual ways to die makes this an excellent addition to the first two. Directed by james wong with style and a pace that hits the ground running, the film is very much like a roller coaster in its self - fast, packed full of laughs and most importantly full of frights."
6100,"What they got right: The uniforms, by and large. There are also a few supporting characters that are interesting like Twins. Beyond that, this seems to be a collection of gee, let's find some pretty looking people and put them in tight uniforms. Twins - one of the best acting jobs - and totally unrealistic. The lacteal fluid extracted from the female of the bovine species is prolific to the Nth degree . )"
6088,"The action scenes were bigger, with great direction and camera - work. A number of great performances from polished actors complimented some truly spectacular action scenes and plot developments and twists. Only someone very dedicated and so confident can get such a project of the ground without having directed a single feature length movie before - get it produced, assemble a professional cast. There was also the added bonus of sex scenes. It was refreshing to see that the werewolves were still practical make - up creations rather than CG."
6086,"It had all the right ingredients (pun intended) of a classic "" feel good "" movie. Queen Latifah definitely knows how to pick a good script. The scenery - and Queen Latifah's wardrobe - were breathtaking and most important, this movie was ENTERTAINING and these days, there are very few films that you can say that about. In the end, this warm, good spirited movie is worth checking out if you like Queen Latifah. She completely splurges, getting the nicest room in the hotel and getting orders of everything in the restaurant, making everyone think she is a very important person."
6085,"The movie delivers the goods: great performances and a lot of sports suspense. Filmed with a gritty, sepia look, the viewer gets the sense that he's watching genuine footage from the '60s. Glory Road is a very entertaining movie if you are will to overlook its many inaccuracies. Production design is just as authentic, using replicas of signs and banners that were at the actual game. The movie chronicles the obstacles he and his players faced, as well as their ultimate triumph when the team won the national championship in 1966."
6084,"The locations shots were awe - inspiring. The scenery is breathtaking, the cinematography stunning, and the costumes remarkably authentic. The story is well told, paced well, and full of thought provoking moments. It's a movie that gets better and better each time you see it; one where you pick out things each time that you had not seen before. The battle scenes are very well done."
6083,"Director Nicholaus Goossen shows that he understands this well. There are laughs throughout the entire film. Nick Swardson (Terry the gay male prostitute from Reno 911) was absolutely hilarious. This is one of those C - list acting B movie comedies that should be awful but it's really pretty funny. The puns and gags are highly memorable, and there are a lot of lovable actors, many of which you wouldn't expect to see in a movie like this, which makes them even more entertaining."
6101,"The kids in this film are very, very good. Younger audiences will be amused by Lawrence, as much as preteens, but there are other films with the same appeal, and some and most of which are better, way better! It's funny, younger kids and teenagers will love it, but adult will like it too, its something for everyone who likes comedy. It really is one of the better commercial movies to be released in Hollywood over the last five years. But what really surprises is how relatively few stupid moments come throughout the movie."
5752,"Great performances all around and kudos to Linklater for his fantastic vision. If you have ever gone on a "" trip "" then you will be instantly able to relate to some of the particular scenes. The variations in certain scenes work very much as well. Keanu Reeves does a really good job in the lead - he's in his element here - but he's really upstaged by Robert Downey Jr. and Woody Harrelson who engage in some surreal and hilarious conversations. Those around him in his "" undercover "" state are James Barris (Robert Downey Jr), Ernie Luckman (Woody Harrelson), Charles Freck (Rory Chochrane), and in one of the most crucial parts to the story Donna (Winona Ryder, quite a good comeback part)."
8540,"Artie O'Day, Jeremy Lucas - they were all good. The other characters are pretty well rounded too. Which was fortunate, because the story itself and the subplots were rich and integral to the story. Check out the soundtrack - it's got some wonderful tunes. Until .Â .Â . This was a really enjoyable film, with hot actors, snappy dialog, and a decent plot."
6671,"Keep your eye on Joachim Trier - he's going places. This strong story and deftly handled craft is bolstered by a couple brilliant performances. Sure the group is fun to join with on their excursions â€” a party towards the end is a lot of fun â€” yet the main three shine above all else. Lastly, and most importantly, is Ander Danielsen Lie portraying Phillip. Espen Klouman - HÃ¸iner as Erik is very good as well."
6677,"It also makes for some fantastic cinema through someone as meticulous and exemplary a filmmaker as the (unprolific) Kaye. On a purely visual level; the shots were flawless, the color choice (or lack of a use of color) was enthralling, and the editing flowed seamlessly back and forth between two sides of an issue that heeds extreme opinions on both ends. It was an outstanding documentary that gave both sides of the issue, even to the point of showing an actual abortion being performed. To summarize, this is an absorbing if somewhat long documentary which presents various arguments for and against abortion and satisfactorily raises most of the issues. Then there's everyone in - between, from radio show hosts to priests and pastors (one of which, an uproarious' Lamb' protector), and then to doctors and professors."
6407,"And none of them had interesting character traits. Despite that, there are some mildly funny parts and the cast is attractive, especially Gretchen Moll. funny, witty, smart, a New York scene with wonderful actors, Justin Kirk, the adorable Gretchen Mol and beautiful Elizabeth Reasor. Wonderful use of New York City as a set, sparkling script, winning performances. Ms. Mol was a true bright spot in this film."
6664,"First, Cantinca Untaru as Alexandria is superb. The colors, the framing, costumes, lighting, and the backdrops are gorgeous; like something out of a dream. The costumes are larger than life and beautiful in their symbolism. Tarsem has a great eye for location and he exhibits it well in this movie. The acting was superb, from both Lee Pace and also Catinca Untaru."
6698,"Inter-generational gay relationships are the missing link of contemporary gay cinema, and the way in which their friendship develops is handled with great poignancy and charm, helped by an impressive performance from the great Patrick Bauchau. The story is biographical in nature: "" X "" (Derek Magyar) is a male hustler who lives off the income from a limited clientÃ¨le of regulars, who occupies a living space with two gay roommates - Andrew (Darryl Stephens) and Joey (Jonathon Trent) - and who has what he thinks it takes to make him happy. This movie is a feel good movie about being gay, being in touch with yourself (at some level) and relationships. It is also fitting, since this is a film about taking risks. It is nice to see a film that takes risks."
6410,"Kudos to the DoP, the cinematography in this film is fantastic and solid throughout. David Schwimmer and Simon Pegg as the two moronic losers are spot on. The supporting cast is also brilliant, especially the surprise of Mimi Rogers as Mrs. Smalls. There is a lot of stuff going on between these characters, and the dynamics between them change all the time, so the movie never gets predictable. Alice Eve as the young nymphet is very good as is Natasha McElhone (who's accent, at times, sounds forced)."
6411,"The atmosphere is well used and the scenes are vivid. It's also true that Hong's improvisational way of working always results in fluid, convincing performances by his actors. When the morning comes, Joong - rae's warm emotions of the previous night have turned chilly. Superficial is a good term to describe Director Kim Jung - rae (Seung - woo Kim). As a result, every moment in the film feels unscripted and real, an illusion greatly enhanced by the excellent performances of Seung - woo Kim, Hyun - jung Go, Seon - mi Song and Tae - woo Kim."
6702,"All this is told with a delicate balancing act, reminding the viewer of the far greater tragedy of the war: the tens of millions of lives lost, most of them civilians. The film takes its viewers on an in depth journey of the subject through seven European countries, most notably France, Italy, Poland and Germany. As a Nazi invasion loomed, hundreds of people, in France's world famous Louvre for example, gathered and worked tirelessly, packing the priceless art and transferring it to castles throughout the French countryside. It shows, through a deep examination of the looting of Europe's treasures, what these works really meant to the countries who had them. This film illustrates and explains the wholesale looting on a vast scale of easily a fifth of Europe's significant cultural treasures."
6794,"The film is shot in beautiful widescreen â€“ an absolutely breathtaking cinematography. And so today they did (the movie is still in the theaters and is doing really good at the box office). Everything is great about this movie. The film's actors deliver top notch performances, the cinematography is excellent, and the sound design is thought through. But thats nothing to what hides behind all the image, where this movie becomes a masterpiece."
6813,"Lots and lots of information to digest, and if you've seen Zizek, you know his pace. And anyone interested in Slavoj Zizek, this is a must as well, much less dry than "" Reality Of The Virtual "", and more direct than "" Zizek! "" It connects these theories with popular film, making them much more palpable and enjoyable than simply reading or thinking about them. mostly brilliant, and worth watching for those interested in movies, psychology, and modern philosophy. And this go - ahead - and - laugh attitude, on the parts of both Fiennes and Zizek, is essential to the gonzo character of the film."
6815,"BrÃ¼hl is as versatile as a haystack. either life is nothing or it must be everything A masterpiece, story -, acting -, picture - and sound-wise. Vogel as Hans is hilariously funny, BrÃ¼hl outstanding as his real counterpart and a compelling Simone Timoteo. Sometime in the mid-90s, Till Schweiger started to mass - produce comedy - drama hybrid movies and it seems that this is the way to go nowadays."
6825,"But what a treat this was, with stunning photography and beautiful locations. Granted, the film did have some rather funny moments. It's more of a well - crafted and absurd comedy than anything else. Dutch film' Ober' is one such film which succeeds enormously as it has chosen a very good theme. Director Alex Van Warmerdam is able to add extra strength to his film by playing the leading role."
6658,"However, you will be pleasantly surprised with a handful of unexpected circumstances. Steve Buscemi is great in everything he does. Alison Lohman plays K'Harma, and does a great job. Some nice performances from Gina Gershon and Alison Lohman round out the cast. Steve Buscemi, as Les Galantine, is hard to watch and hard to pull away from from beginning to end."
6421,"It's a refreshing break from Elton John power ballads. Akio Ohtsuka and Koichi Yamadera, Batou & Togusa of Ghost in the Shell fame, both play major roles as well. Satoshi Kon's "" Paprika "" is a great example of anime at its finest. Kon's new film is not the dark mind warps of Perfect Blue or Paranoia Agent, this is closer to blending of real and unreal of Millennium Actress and Tokyo Godfathers light and airy touches. If you've ever seen and enjoyed Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbound, it'll help you understanding what's going on in the film."
6423,"The CG sequences are slicker and more impressive, and so is pretty much everything else, including the consistently confident directing. But for those willing to start at the beginning this is one of the most rewarding pieces of cinema you'll ever see. The set pieces are spectacular, there are things in this movie to make your jaw drop open (the influx of American money can be seen on the screen in sequences that top the first film). It is comparable by grandiosity to Titanic, and to StarWars by excitement, to The Matrix by plot. You can fee the film's origins as a novel bleeding off the screen giving this version of Moscow a very real sense of place."
6424,"The way in which Shane blends these two aspects together without compromising on either is most impressive. Delivering a surprising, enchanting performance in the lead role as Shaun, Thomas Turgoose portrays a youngster of incredible warmth and charisma. Thomas Turgoose is magnificent in the lead role and the direction / screenplay are also spot on the mark. This is England crosses the boundary of the purely British audience oriented motion picture to a larger scale scenario where its intricacies are presented in manners which well enable the international audience to get a small picture of a bigger problem. After the success of' Dead Man's Shoes' local filmmaker Shane Meadows returns with' This is England' a story of absence and isolation, belonging and the power of persuasion."
6425,"Just amazed at the sensitivity of the direction and the spectacular performances. Julie Christie, for whom the lead role was written, exudes dynamic good looks and the vibrancy of a young woman, bathed in such warmth and passion of years. One thought that would be her best turn at geriatric impersonations. Polley directs three beautifully nuanced performances from her leads. The occasional lucid moments offering hope, only to be followed, often quickly, by the bafflement of the dementia."
6846,"Troma fans delight, Lloyd has returned with a film definitely worth waiting all of these years for, and he pulls no punches and makes no appologies. The talented and beautiful Kate Graham does some fine acting as well as the lead Jason Yachanin. So, get some friends together, grab some brews, and laugh till you drop. So naturally Arbie decides the best way to get revenge, is to get a job there. Oh joy of joys, why aren't there more movies like this around."
6967,"And when you've attained wealth and stardom in a rather dubious manner, you're in for some real' shiiiit'. While it does have its funny moments, this segment is the most serious in tone. Smile worthy cheesy moments, a couple. For a low budget film like this to receive the theatrical release that was just announced in the trades is amazing. It's probably best enjoyed with friends and forties."
7000,"Script, direction and performances were superb. It is one of the best GLBT Asian films to come out in the past 5 years. There are some great films coming out of S. Korea; this is one. NO REGRET places a member of each of these disparate groups together and the impact of opposite backgrounds is the thread that weaves so well through this love story. So unique, inventive, fascinating, unexpected, beautifully acted (beautiful in all senses of the word), and with direction so insanely brilliant it was a gift to this movie lover."
7004,"Other good Gay teen movies are TCOC is basically a fine and fun movie. What it does do is reinforce --- in a fun way --- the principles of standing up for oneself, appreciating the friends one does have and, most importantly, keeping hope (re: that last 2 - person scene in this movie). TH is not a stunner (that part fell to Brett Chukerman as Chance's neighbor and friend), but he's good - looking enough in a sort of unobtrusive way. Tad Hilgenbrink does a great job and is totally convincing as Chance, the young, intelligent gay high school kid that has decided to be true to his gay and somewhat extravagant self in whatever circumstances he finds himself, which provokes all kinds of strong reactions from people around him, like his teachers, his father and some bullying high school jocks."
6429,"There is something utterly well thought out about how everything happened. Jones was all of a piece with the likes of Charles Manson or David Koresh. The strength of this film lies in the fact that it isn't just a play - by - play from afar, but a collection of first - hand interviews with people who were actually there, and who knew the key players. It does a good job of showing what attracted people to the Peoples Temple and how, gradually, things started to go very wrong. Once he comprehended the uniqueness of his mission there was really no limit to his ambitions - he could be anything - he could be the son of God or he could be an avenging angel."
7132,"Zach Galifianakis is probably one of the best comedians to come out of the scene in the last 10 years he's definitely that good, he's a top ten without a doubt on anybody's list who truly understands comedy. His innovation in how he presents his material can be better than the material itself, though he does have some solid laughs on here. They still worked well to showcase how quick Zach is, because he bounces instantly off something the audience - member says into something brilliant. His one - liner zings of racism, idiocracies or just observations while looking (again) intoxicated or simply uninterested, make the whole act."
7218,"More information, more stock footage, more direction, and many other things that make the difference between a good documentary and a great one. It was very moving and emotional for how these girls grew up on the set of "" Annie "" and grew up with the show as a whole, and were soon enough kicked off to live their own lives. They coped well with life after their silver platters went away, and it could have been the result of their good, attentive parents. "" Life After Tomorrow "" is unique in the sense that it tells that now - familiar story, but the end results of the women who were interviewed for this documentary are almost never sad. The stories these women told about their experiences were usually fascinating."
6625,"It truly displays Ricci's talents and makes you realise how she has come a long way since The Addams Family. It is packed full of excitement, surprises, laughs, heartfelt pangs and soaring joy. Kids will laugh and adults can watch this without falling asleep. It is a treat to see Reese Witherspoon portraying an edgier gal than norm and James McAvoy is a heartthrob! Although it wasn't very long, it was pleasing to see her in a very different role from others that she took."
7248,"He has looked at how the formative years made the man. The tone in which Cobain spoke felt genuine, and the pacing of the interviews was perfect. Basically all of the clips you see are merged together with what he is saying to give a sense of atmosphere and relevance. The pictures visualise everything for you, so you get the full emotional experience. Spending time in libraries to keep warm."
6146,"After a decade of anti-sex AIDS - induced hysteria, a film about a wildly - sexual hotbod who thrill - kills to heighten her sexual pleasure was pretty enticing stuff. That it resoundingly fails on so many levels, and in such a way to be a career nadir for everyone involved, is really quite extraordinary to watch. The rest of the cast is outstanding, giving performances that are far better than the material deserves. She is an intelligent actress who is not afraid of taking risks and can play with camp at her leisure. Even Stone gives her character a different dimension, creating a lustful, devilish Catherine Trimell, who can perfectly well rank among other monsters like Hannibal Lecter."
7254,"The best parts about it are: the music, the characters, the silences, and the themes. For this is truly an original film that has indie written all over it, in both style and substance, and has elements of drama and comedy and wonder and twists and turns galore. Those three elements force a focus on these young folks' faces, and so much of this script is told through Haas and Jones' incredibly expressive eyes. He has some excellent qualities; he's a talented mechanic who applies himself to his job. If you love indies you'll smile as the opening credits roll."
6148,"Alright, let's just say it right from the start: the MPAA sucks. Some examples are: Kubrick, Tarantino, Lynch, Woo, Friedkin, Peckinpah, Aronofsky, and countless others. This even leads - more intriguingly - into the more deceptive group of appellant board members of the MPAA. It is also well put together, so it is easier to watch than most documentaries. All of these clips are excellently edited together, and in some instances, offer some pretty amusing anecdotes."
6149,"It's obvious from the previews that this is a bit of a comedy. It keeps the audiences entertained like few other movies can. The dialogues are often hilarious, particularly the mayor is quite a character, and the cast members all seem very happy to be a part of this production. While it's easy to see the influences of every horror movie from Night of the Living Dead (1968) to Tremors (1989), Slither is itself a gutsy horror ride that firmly stands on its own. Every scene is a homage to great cult classics and hits its target audience in the head with a 50 pound bag of fun dropped from the Empire State Building."
6150,"After a huge crowd comes out to support the team, the guys decide to enter a competition with the bullies. Jon Heder is "" almost "" Napolean Dynamite, similar voice, but the character is funnier. Rob Schneider, David Spade, Nick Swardson and Jon Lovitz are all good in their parts whilst Jon Heder seems to be stuck in his Napolean Dynamite character. David Spade stole the show however, he did a very good job and needless to say his character was the real barrel of laughs within the film. If you've been a fan of Adam Sandler's work (this is a Happy Madison production), you'll like this movie."
6151,"The direction stays sober and controlled despite the infinite possibilities of the medium, and that is a really good surprise. It is a full 3d movie with a high contrasted black and white render. The film is tremendously atmospheric, its dizzying, swooping faux - camera moves and adult tone making for a very engaging experience. In this optic, it goes one step further than the excellent "" Sin City "" adaptation from R. Rodriguez. They have used live action motion capture fitted into key - frame animation, with stark jet black and bright white contrasts and a heavily shadowed rotoscoped background."
6152,"Jennifer Aniston does her best work since "" The Good Girl "" (2002). Franny (Joan Cusack) is very rich, just raises her kids with full time help, and is perfectly happy with her husband Matt (Greg Germann), her two children, and the world. Anniston does her best, which here works better than in any of her other roles. But Aniston has a fine sense of finding that line between comedy and drama without pushing either one too far. A pivot point is the pet fiction in American social comedy that friends stay together even when their fortunes come to vary widely."
6154,"If you liked the other movies, especially 3, this is a must see. Craig Bierko does a very good Tom Cruise impression, as well. Anna Faris (Cindi), as always, is still on top form, as is Regina Hall (Brenda) and together, they deliver some fantastic comedy. This turned out to be an extremely funny movie, which does an extremely good job at parodying movies such as Saw, Saw II, The Village, The Grudge and War of the Worlds. She meets Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko) and they bond pretty quickly."
7435,"It's smart, insightful and touching at times. She mostly hit the right notes here and it was a very subtle, very calm turn that fits the character nicely for sure. Charlotte Roche and Josef Ostendorf put in strong performances in the main roles. Ostendorf especially puts forth an emotional performance and as wonderful as Roche is, it is Ostendorf who carries the movie. Anyone with a tiny bit of love for food will enjoy and understand the power of well cooked, prepared and thought about meals."
6157,"Still, her's is highlighted by a magnificent ensemble, particularly Tomlin and Streep, who give dazzling performances. You can see some photos at PHCFan. After all these years, they've still got it - and Tomlin, an Altman favorite, is particularly up to par with the snap - and - go dialogue. The cinematography is rich and sensational, often whirling between different sets in long, gorgeously extended shots. The exteriors in the movie are all real, and the stage, the sets and auditorium shots of the Fitzgerald are likewise genuine."
6158,"Eva Longoria is very attractive though. The one with real actors, good story lines - and good Cinemaphotography. It's a decent suspense and investigative thriller, with enough subplots to keep you entertained. Eva Longoria appeared out of place, and the rest didn't seem very interesting. Every action and suspenseful scene was missing the added element that separates TV - movies from box - office blockbusters."
6159,"The atmosphere was perfect, the acting was on point, the creatures were amazing, well, everything was amazing. The production design is truly superb and you get the feeling that Silent Hill really does exist. Again, it really is the best horror movie in years! Sounds, music, colors and even meticulous set design that pays homage to the game series. Also, a lot of the sounds and music tracks from the games are used, and so are the monsters."
6436,"That's how persuasive the sets were! Just adventure and very likable performances. Everything was in its place and geared up to thrill you. Always nice to see Jane Curtain, and of course Olympis Dukakis. His character is certainly mysterious and full of dead pan remarks."
6178,"There was a feast of brilliant colors shown. There is dynamic lighting, proper shot composition, and interesting camera movements. It works here and he hits the right comic tones. Black is great and pulls off some excellent poses. Also, if you appreciate bold, beautiful colors, you'll find this an attractive movie."
6163,"The movies are about a government sponsored high - tech commando team that uses force to achieve their goals, including Spiderman - like stunts, video - game - like chases, explosions, firefights and duke - outs with the bad guys, all of which would advertise their presence to the world and likely negate anything they accomplish while signing their own death warrants. Ving Rhames, Jonathan Rhys - Meyers and Maggie Q merely look cool as his helpers, and Laurence Fisburne and Billy Crudup successfully bring that edge of moral ambiguity to their characters. "" Mission: Impossible III, "" the latest installment of the blockbuster movies which in turn were based from a TV series, is for those looking for a way to start off the summer season at the movies. The name of the game is entertainment, and this movie provides it in spades, hence the good rating. To aid him are Ving Rhames, Jonathon Rhys - Meyers and Maggie Q, and, this being a third, there are gadgets, explosions, sets and plot twists like now other."
6164,"And the weird Gornicke were just adorable. It turned out to be a vacation trip full of laughs. Anyway, if you enjoy the easy writings of Thomas More or Therese of Avila, this film is your best bet. The entire case does an ensemble version of' Route 66' over the closing credits, which is worth staying for. The movies are chosen to be kid friendly."
6165,"It was something that came from the heart, and after viewing the intense performances and believably real reactions, that also becomes apparent. The cast of passengers are a group of largely unknowns, which lends great respectability and reality. There were no Bruce Willis or Wesley Snipe types amongst the passengers; they were ordinary folk in extraordinary situations, responding the best way they could. Masterfully written and directed by Paul Greengrass, this relentlessly intense movie covers that fateful morning when United Airlines Flight 93 departed Newark for San Francisco with 33 passengers and seven crew members on board. United 93 is a truly inspiring tale about the 4th hijacked plane that crashed in Pennsylvania."
6166,"Overall, "" Stick It "" is one of the funniest "" girly - teeny - booper "" movies out there. Go see this movie, it's entertaining, well shot and has a few laughs along the way to boot. While not a serious drama, this family movie brings with it a nice balance of family values, rebellious teen coming of age movie, and light humor that maintains an edge. Cheesiness is a given within this movie, as are tons of laughs, beautiful girls, attitude, and two gorgeous guys. But, if you sit through it, you realize that it cooks up a lot of valid food - for - thought."
7640,"It has not become soft or lost all sense of anger but on the contrary the emotion within his delivery tends to be more well rounded and well observed. Moran twists and savages everyone and everything with his unique view of things. With "" Like, Totally "" he has refined his on screen personae to some degree to the point where he seems a lot more relaxed and affable but still retains his same imaginative style of humour. Some of his jumps later in the show are sudden and seem a bit random but mostly it works well. Second Concert DVD from the mad Irishman is very funny."
6168,"The voices are very well done as well. It has some really funny parts that are not clichÃ© humor. Plenty of clever asides will appeal to a wholesome sort of cultural nostalgia, without ever seeming derivative or repetitive. With the likes of Steve Carell, William Shatner, and Thomas Haden Church; this movie is a true hit. Subtle messages about equal treatment, honesty, trust, and friendship are present without being heavy handed."
6169,"It is clearly a subject on which Terry Zwigoff has a lot to say, and he says it very eloquently. The cast is terrific: John Malkovic, Anjelica Huston, Jim Broadbent, Sophie Myles, among others. The performances are great and the script is witty. Ethan Suplee provides the hyper - actively aggressive role he has become beloved for. Zwigoff's direction is also very impressive."
6179,"This is very simply a lovely film on every level, from dialog, to direction, to cinematography, to consistently outstanding acting performances across the board. The acting is fine and the chemistry between the leads is very real. Plus, the whole theater laughed at some parts, plus people gasped and cried, and at the end everyone applauded. See it with someone you desire. See this film with someone you love."
6170,"But these new action - survivors don't seem to require toilets. POSEIDON, the remake, is apparently far from being on its last leg; sparkling new and lavishly decorated in nondescript, tasteless elegance, it is carrying a passenger list of dubious VIPs, who don't even have enough dimension to be clichÃ©s and are played by actors, who, though competent, would barely even rate being on the B - list. Despite these flaws, there were a few engaging scenes and some touching moments. This is definitely not the motley group of survivors found in the original. The original film had its ragtag band of survivalists interacting with their topsy - turvy environment, where this time the stunts and sets and CGI simply overwhelm everything and everybody."
7256,"The women escape unscathed, perfect catchers, people that exist in some sort of harmony with life, who can find a place and a rhythm. The three women's distinct quality â€“ intelligence, sensuousness and innocence, respectively â€“ are well portrayed by the three actresses. The film is so easy to fall into, it unlike almost anything Greenaway has done before. There is so much to talk about; the movie provides endless references to works of Art. Like all Greenway films, this one to be watched many times to discover new and new layers."
6442,"The first Hostel had some genuinely suspenseful moments and Cabin Fever even had a few "" don't do that! "" Lauren Graham turns in a pretty good performance and Beth is the only one of these females who actually feels somewhat like a real person. The story is quite similar to the first one, except the great twist in the last five minutes with the action and revenge of the clever and rich Beth. If you believed everything that came out of the Hostel: Part 2 director's mouth, you'd be under the impression that this was a new lesson in extreme cinema, pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable on screen to new and previously unheard of levels. Less like a talented kid going crazy in a blood filled candy store, and more like someone turning into an all round excellent horror purveyor."
6324,"Once again Hilary Swank did a terrific job as always! The acting by everyone, especially by Hilary Swank, was great. Even better it's true to life humor, things that would actually happen. Surely there are gifted teens who could do the job! As usual, Hillary Swank puts in a good performance."
6340,"Makes FD3 look like a masterpiece. Only remakes that are superior that come to mind is "" the Fly "" and "" the Thing "". Remakes are in 9 out of 10 cases a lot worse than the originals. But the 2007 embalming of Robert Harmon's 1986 masterpiece The Hitcher is the kind of mechanical exercise that gives not only remakes but horror in general a bad name. The key difference is that in the original movie the love interest, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh, didn't come into the story until late; a significant chunk of the storyline was devoted to a cat - and - mouse game between two characters, Rutger Hauer's chilling hitcher, and hapless victim C. Thomas Howell."
6343,"Saw the premiere and the movie has all the earmarks of a major hit. Instead, Terabithia uses the talents of both the amazing young actors, and its adult cast to enthrall and absorb the viewer in the magic of imagination and the reality of every - day life. Terabithia, a land of beautiful creatures and dangerous enemies, springs forth from their imaginations, and becomes a place to call their own, away from the bullies and monotony of everyday life. This movie is full of heart and everything about it is shown from the eyes of a child. The movie's script greatly aided in the believability of the characters, and the motion of the scenes, which were crisp and well - planned."
6346,"It developed the characters well, especially Keri Russell's (Jenna). These are characters, who for the most part, make the best of their situations. Andy Griffith in particular grabs the audience's attention and makes his role a true standout. And unlike many "" labor of love "" films, this one is actually both highly entertaining and easily accessible. Shelly herself and Cheryl Hines are solid in their support (Shelly is adorable), but keep the spotlight firmly on Ms. Russell."
6352,"Now to the good parts of the movie. Very, very clichÃ© spoof film, you could tell what was coming the whole way through (with a few stupid exceptions). Pre-teens, teens and young adults have shown that they have interests in seeing well - written, acted, developed and intelligent movies. Some movies are funny, some are not. This movie may be funny to you, if you liked Date Movie, since both films are pretty much the same in cast and script quality."
6353,"She's a great looking woman with a slim, fashion - friendly body and yet, she looked like a fool in those crinoline - crazed shirtwaists that spun out so wide she looked like a whirling dervish. The actions of this modern - day Yenta the Matchmaker set into motion a whole host of sitcom - level complications and romantic comedy hijinks that are somehow supposed to be funny but wind up being merely irritating. There aren't going to be any surprises, it's just entertaining, lively, and very sweet. especially in L. A. Of course, there is more to this movie than Diane Keaton. It is consistently funny, but only through cheap and superficial jokes and scenarios."
6354,"Gaspard Ulliel did a very good job and has a wonderful look about him. Gaspard Ulliel does a really good job as Lecter. Great locations, great acting--especially by Gaspard Ulliel as Hannibal. 1) Superb direction (Lecter's riverside encounter with Paul Momund is stunning in its ballet - like choreography); 2) a perfectly paced screenplay; 3) beautiful art direction and design; and 4) powerful performances. Ulliel's finest moment is when Lecter unleashes his unhinged wrath in the climatic scene aboard the river barge; it was thoroughly disturbing."
6355,"This is definitely one a Eddie Murphy's best movies! On the one positive note: Eddie Murphy does put his all into these characters as always. It's a film aimed for laughs and it does exactly what it delivers. HAHHAHAHAHAHAHA, im laughing now thats how funny this movie was. It isn't meant to be an epic tale with deep metaphors and tons of symbolism, it is meant to be funny, and it succeeds."
6358,"etc aspects of the film are awesome. The colors are very lush and detailed; very accurate toward a real city - scape. It was really funny, often in unexpected places, the storyline kept you engaged the entire time and the overall mood was lighthearted and inspiring. Ratatouille is filled with loads of surprises and lots of twists and turns. - There were a few moments when they seemed to lose that stylized reality they had established and things looked merely "" real ""."
6362,"There are a good number of laughs in "" Ghost Rider . "" When he changes to Ghost Rider, his laughs are impressive, that creates a crazy hero and that is a new and cool feature! Ghostrider is a brilliantly designed character. In fact hes TOO cool - it seems that in any comic, cartoon or game hes involved with, he always comes out as the most interesting thing. The flaming skull effects are believable (well, as believable as flaming skulls get), and most of the bike - riding while on flames scenes hold up well also."
6363,"This brings Borroughs to her only recourse â€“ informing O'Neill that Hanssen is everything they claim him to be and more. Gary Cole plays it straight here, and Kathleen Quinlan (as Hanssen's wife) and Bruce Davison (as Eric O'Neill's dad) have brief but effective turns. Breach is one of those rare spy movies that is almost perfect. Cooper does such a great job of capturing Hanssen's intimidation of young Eric O'Neill and his increasing paranoia. It's true that his performance is a bit of a Johnny - one - note at times, but since the function of the character is that of observer rather than catalyst, Philippe's self - effacing underplaying seems the right editorial choice here."
6364,"She sure has a lot of talent for playing someone with pluck and a little bit of endearing wackiness. -- Hugh Grant's one - sentence witty remarks came out natural and funny. it's one of those movies that just makes you feel good. -- Their ability to poke fun of two distinct musical decades could be better, but still turned out pretty funny. While perhaps doing little more than playing new aspects of themselves, it is a delightful performance, and one backed up with catchy songs, a fabulous debut by Haley Bennett (Cora) and a heartfelt, realistic script."
6365,"he is good at thrillers being at the helm of Falling Down and Phone Booth. This is true to Jim Carrey. This movie has great atmosphere, and Jim Carrey DOES show that he can be a GOOD serious / dramatic / non-slapstick actor. When the film turns into a good murder mystery, you really get your dollars worth. The acting was tight (though there are a few scenes that fall somewhat flat, as with any movie), the script was well written, and it is pretty spooky."
6366,"For new viewers, it's worth checking out. No matter: the film does an excellent job of establishing its tone and the specifics of the characters right off the bat. Every character gets a chance to shine, and anybody that doesn't know anything about them will learn quickly what makes each deputy unique. Each character is also well - defined with particular quirks, hangups and issues with the other characters. If you've never seen the series, everything in the movie will be fresh and amusing."
6371,"It certainly is one of the funniest movies at the moment! Having it introduced by the stars Simon & Nick was a real bonus. Hands down this fantastic film is the new benchmark in British comedies! Even though the film does take a lot of twists and turns there isn't really a moment where it lacks energy. Just like SOTD, they are ably supported by a cast of familiar faces from British film and TV."
6377,""" moments when the action is at its most intense. The best part of all is that, unlike most movies these days, the previews don't give away every good scene. She makes films more interesting to watch, by dint of her strong performances. Drama, humor, really fine action sequences, twists, great characters. "" The Golden Man "" is a much more ordinary story, but with resounding insights on the consequences of his existence."
6380,"One of the most brilliant aspects of the film is its pacing. Jake Gyllenhall and Robert Downey Jr. put in excellent performances, as does Mark Ruffalo. The main performances are excellent - Robert Downey Jr and Jake Gyllenhaal in particular are a standout. ZODIAC feels like it was made by a perfectionist, everything flows so smoothly. The opening 4th of July sequence is worthy of the ticket price alone."
6381,"however, the adventures these guys have on their trip are hilarious. With that said --- Wild Hogs is absolutely wonderful. This one had tons of laughs & great sight gags. This movie was filled with laughs and good gags. Then, the "" Wild Hogs "" met the other bikers, and it was all over."
6383,"The Last Mimzy doesn't pander needlessly to its core audience, but at the same time it also has a good accomplishment in that it also has an appeal to adults, or at least those that have passed that age of adolescence and look back on childhood with levels of nostalgia and relief that it's over. The Ending is bright and optimistic, and dispels the sometimes threatening imagery depicted in scenes of the future. On the other hand, the movies Prologue nearly robs the film of all it's potential drama, suspense and magic. "" All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe "" The Mimsy before this one was apparently sent to Lewis Carroll, who shared it with his young friend Alice, who had an adventure in Wonderland. In it lies a bunch of fragments, and, oddly enough, a stuffed, fluffy, cute bunny named Mimzy, who Emma takes as her most important possession."
6391,"Adam plays two levels very well. He has the qualities of sincerity and honesty that comes through in this role. Some of the scenes don't work as well as others, but overall it is well written and solidly directed. A deeply moving film sure to put tears in your eyes and a smile on your face. The supporting roles by Jada Pinkett Smith, Liv Tyler, Saffron Burrows (in a very odd role), Donald Sutherland, and Mike Binder himself are all quite good."
6387,"Not only is it visually stunning but the performances from everyone are superb. The performances in this film are universally excellent. There were some beautiful scenes, some so intense. The story is well told, with excellent performances all round (especially Anne Hathaway and the always brilliant James Cromwell). And finally the two very charming leads who are the very heart of the movie: Anne Hathaway and James McAvoy."
6389,"She pulled it off with gold stars. It is a fairly well done, thought provoking experience and is carried by some better than average performances by a strong cast. It's a good movie if you don't analyze things. The soundtrack was fantastic and right up there with the Sixth Sense in terms of effectiveness; none of it got in the way of the action. It is important to keep in mind that the movie is made on a time - line of contingencies, so that what would otherwise be inconsistent actually can make sense in light of changes introduced by the non-sequential experiences of Sandra Bullock's character."
6390,"As good as it is, it is not without a small amount of horror clichÃ©. It's a twist - ending, but don't let that put you off - it works well with the rest of the movie, it's not one of those "" bad movie twists "". There is some great sets in the film as well. It's pretty difficult for horror movies to continually be original, and this certainly has some moments in it. Kwanten is good as the lead and Wahlberg has a few nice and purposefully funny moments in his role."
6392,"Mark Wahlbergs performance was top notch. The film was both engaging and entertaining, and Mark Wahlberg did a very good job of portraying the character in all of his idiosyncrasies. The film really puts you into the shoes of a sniper and gives an impressive overview of the mindset that it takes to be as accurate as someone of the character of Swagger. Shooter is a smart, engaging and all out enjoyable action flick that never pulls its punches and always surprises you when you least expect it. There are many sweeping shots used to try and epic - ize the movie, and set action sequences take priority, reducing character development to the token time available between scenes, and sometimes at the expense of plausibility."
6393,"Of course it's not going to be an Oscar nominated film, it's just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for 90 minutes. With his excellent film, Alexandre Aja nearly single - handedly altered the general opinion about horror remakes, as he had the courage and intellect of changing essential elements in the plot and adding more nauseating gore than anyone could ever had hoped for. It's a really good film and, even though an avalanche of new sequels and clones will be inevitable, it's highly unlikely that one of them will ever equal the surprising quality level of Aja's smashing hit. "" The Hills Have Eyes II "" follows a group of National Guard trainees. Gone are the family, and in comes a small squad of National Guard trainees."
6394,"+ DESIGN: along the same lines as the animation, the general look and design of everything was pretty cool. their designs fit in well with the overall look of NY city, which is dark, worn and very impressive. The secret usually lies in the ability to recapture the good parts from the original and add modern touches in order to attract new viewers. Basically if you liked the original movies than you'll be in for a treat. Voice acting is pretty well done by the likes of Chris Evans, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Patrick Stewart, Mako, Kevin Smith and Ziyi Zhang."
6395,"Overall a satisfying drama with sustained tension and some fine performances. The Lookout was an amazing movie with splendid performances all around. The cinematography and editing are adequate, yet strangely, in many scenes, particularly those that take place at the main character's family's home and those that takes place at the bank, have great atmosphere, a coziness. The movie is, upon reflection, reminiscent of realist films from the 1970s in its story and directorial style. In the 21st century, there are very few films worth seeing, in comparison to the earlier 80's, and 90's."
6396,"The beginning of the movie, the set - up, is wonderfully written, and the over-the-top tone that's established in these opening scenes is successfully carried throughout. Ferrell and Heder play very well off each other. "") are funny enough to carry the film for large sections. Ferrell and Heder work wonderfully together; the ice skating scenes are pulled off very well; and, of course, there are tons of quotable lines. If you like these kinds of films you will love this film."
6397,"No real surprises here, but fun fun fun! Both movies were well executed, well scored, well written, and well played. The film has two great scenes. All of the actors' performances were right on and the action directing was excellent. Rodriguez's Machete trailer that opens Grindhouse is amazing, and sets the tone for everything that follows."
6398,"The tagline of this movie is perfect. A heartwarming story with eye - popping 3D special effects. All put together in an astoundingly gorgeous film - easily enjoyed by ALL ages. The characters become deeper and more realistic, their motivations and personalities shine through, and the storyline becomes absolutely fantastic. Gorgeous "" Little Wonders "" by the fantastic Rob Thomas played at the end coordinated with the story ending - beautifully done."
6400,"Cillian Murphy gets the starring role, and he's good. Nice work by Michelle Yeoh, Rose Byrne and Cliff Curtis. From the jaw dropping opening sequence to the fantastically realised final moments, Boyle's latest is a mighty treat for the eyes. Mace's emotive instability injects pace when it's needed and brings some welcome variety to the otherwise glum faces. When the film ditches pretensions, and sticks with the clammy, slow burn thrills it excels at, it's fantastic."
6403,"The most developed and well acted character is really Ribisi's. The answer exists simply in whatever of the three endings worked out the best. Perfect Stranger lacked meaning, taste, and creativity and is just another one of those "" movies with a twist . "" Bruce Willis and Halle Berry have acted much better in past, but are watchable regardless, as well as Giovanni Ribisi; suspense thriller is made bearable but eventually degenerates. The film improves somewhat in the middle, with a couple of tense scenes (like the one in the car with Willis suspecting Berry of being a spy, or Berry's entrance into Ribisi's "" secret room ""), and a few interesting (if brief) views of the net - chatting world."
6404,"Everything in this movie is done well. Disturbia star Shia LaBeouf appears to have a great future ahead of him. It had a new and fresh feeling with teens and it worked, despite how it seemed a bit more predictable than Rear Window, it still was pretty clever. It's a tool that works to great effect in terms of creating tension, placing him in the same position as the audience. However, at a brisk 104 minutes, it would be a lie to say the movie wasn't extremely satisfying, and an undeniably entertaining film."
6405,"These brief descriptions are about all the depth these characters ever acquire. Scenes start and end with absolutely no flow. In that respect, the film offers some depth to the little story that is filled with violent battle scenes. The only redeeming feature of this movie were the well made action scenes (not all were good, but overall there were more enjoyable fight sequences than boring ones). Most of "" Pathfinder "" is given over to ridiculous chases and fights that remind you how skillful "" Apocalypto "" was at similar scenes."
6406,"From the days of Bunuel and Dali to the years of Fellinni and Lynch to be followed by the genius that is The Aqua Teen Hunger Force. With animation so beautiful in it's simplicity, voices that could not fit better (specifically the Master Shake), and the freshest thing since Darwinism. Frylock is the logical and responsible one, Master Shake is abrasive and aggressive yet lacking common sense or intelligence (very much like a teenager who thinks jackass is brilliant programming and deems himself intelligent for knowing good TV when he sees it) and Meatwad, who is naive and irresponsible, but otherwise good hearted and just along for the ride. Rest assured, Aqua Teen fans, this movie will definitely fulfill and surpass all your expectations for an Aqua Teen movie. Space Ghost C2C (which many of the ATHF producers worked on before this) was brilliant for it's pauses."
6408,"Marian Cotillard is simply amazing in the role. The rest of the cast is first - rate, and the film beautifully evokes the eras covered in her life. All the cast is incredible and Marion Cotillard IS Edith Piaf. Heart and soul are in total sync here and Cotillard manages to age astonishingly well. Marion Cotillard as Piaf was a dream to watch."
6409,"Scenes with Gosling are entertaining to watch. While it might not be possible in real life, it worked magic on the big screen and transformed into an excellent film almost within the first few minutes. Both characters are cocky and smart and the twists and turns just add to the fun. Hopkins and Gosling take it to the next level with great lead performances. He is what draws people to theatres and he is one of the most brilliant actors of all times."
6413,"Just the right touch of someone who is more than they seem, and not realizing that themselves. But its OK, cause thats life. However, it was a 100 minutes well spent. In a return of Meg Ryan along with some new young actors, this movie has some fine moments of focus on higher level emotional and narrative dialogues without the stuffy intellectual performances. In what could have been a soupy chick flick Jon Kasdan has instead provided a script that has a healthy dose of homespun philosophy and has guided his multi-talented cast to offer some of their finest moments on film."
6414,"And thanks for all the laughs. Now for some people this will cause great excitement, for others it will cause them to groan very loudly. It's a well rounded comedy movie, that will be funny to children and adults alike. The sight gags and physical humour aren't exactly intellectual, but they are very funny and fresh most of the time and the comedy is, well, kind of classy. So ignore the haters and enjoy a laugh out loud joke every 5 minutes or so."
6415,"The performances are pretty good, though. Justin Chatwin and Margarita Levieva are incredibly believable and both seem to really enjoy the material. But nonetheless "" The Invisible "" remains an occasionally very engaging and fast - paced thriller, admirably translated to the screen by genre - expert David S. Goyer. Justin Chatwin ("" Taking Lives "") and Margarita Levieva are terrific and actually manage to make their implausible characters convincing and at least a bit likable near the end. The characters of Nick and Annie clearly gain maturity throughout the story and by the end of the film, they evolved from annoying teenage brats to."
6416,"The cast is good too, and provide good performances. Most of the fight scenes in the movie are great, and there's plenty of fights, action and explosions going on non-stop throughout the movie. However having said that it has got all the ingredients in it to keep fans of the action genre connected and the story just picks up and moves on at a good pace with action to keep you hooked in. It's a bit like the well - known fact that the most vociferous anti-porn campaigners also happen to own the biggest collections of porn! They are similarly rigged with an explosive device which if tampered, or if they choose not to participate, they too will be blown to bits."
6417,"All the fight - scenes were EXCELLENT, well choreographed and exciting. The Daily Bugle scenes, as always, were great and funny. The fight scenes were also incredibly well realized. Topher Grace did a fine job as Brock, not so great as Venom. Peter, Harry, Mary Jane, Aunt May, etc. also carry over well and it's easy to jump back into their lives."
6426,"And Katherine Heigl is equally entertaining. played quite well by Kristin Wiig and Alan Tudyk, were humorous. Paul Rudd and Seth Rogan at Cirque d'Soleil in an altered state is a hilarious scene. This is a sharp comedy and cutting insight thanks to a terrific script, excellent comedic timing from Seth Rogen and Apatow's feel for a scene. Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader from SNL are great in their small roles."
6443,"With the chronology of the omniscient narrative skewed and certain scenes misleading, Paranoid Park establishes a near perfect balance between form and content. At the age of just 15, Nevins' not only performs with a quality beyond his tender years and experience, but provides a leading performance that is as convincing as it is impressive. The depiction of grownups from a teenage perspective is fascinating. Warm electronic tones and burblings envelope a continuous slow - motion camera shot of skateboarders as they rove around the the curves and angles of the park and the effect is really quite magical. The naivety and confusion stirring behind Nevins' infantile eyes are both complimented and mirrored by the structure of the plot."
6427,"Oh, and the performances were overall excellent. Nikki Blonsky was one terrific Tracy. The casting was really well done, the sets were very well decorated. Travolta, Pfeiffer and Walken are a hoot and Nikki Blonsky couldn't be more perfect. Nikki Blonsky premiered beautifully as the spunky and voluptuous Tracy Turnblad."
6428,"The movie starts off well with the jumps and the pulse pounding action. The movie contained everything it needed to be become a classic horror movie. The actions scenes are masterfully done, effectively placing the viewer in the points of view of both the victims and the crazed, but still scarily human, zombies. But with all the action you'll still be on the edge of your seat, and the jumps to tell you truth are an added incentive. Think of the beginning scene of the Dawn of the Dead remake, but put it in the whole film, with a few chill spots with well placed acting."
6431,"To its credit, there were several very clever scenes. Nevertheless, it's still worth a look, and still carries positive messages entertainingly. Both of those movies had an meaningful and multidimensional plot. Shrek the Third has the return of the whole cast, including the new heir to the thrown, Arthur. Shrek the third did not continue this trend."
6432,"Archaic, unrequited, love, universally known and unknown, and as a friend said about the movie and its songs: no great art came from happiness. It is bittersweet and romantic, with great music (not Irish music, but the singer / songwriter type) as the two main characters collaborate on their songs and help each other become stronger and face the romantic challenges they both are suffering from. The end of the film is wonderful and Hollywood - clichÃ© - free! A masterpiece with great central performances and amazing music. It was a gorgeous straightforward film about two people meeting at a certain time in their lives."
6433,"The details on the sets is just as breathtaking. mix haphazardly against elaborate sets and computer graphics. The characters are surprisingly likable, and Depp comes roaring in like a breath of fresh air as Capt. Jack. In its action moments the movie gets definitely uplifted by its musical score. Orlando Bloom's and Keira Knightley's acting also has really improved over the years."
6434,"This is an assault to the mind, not the eyes, and it's exceptionally well done. He has it all, a beautiful wife, a wonderful company, an awesome home, and a daughter (Danielle Panabaker) in college. His character is a creative blend of voyeuristic and eagerly putzy, and Cook pulls it off very becomingly. Together, the two talented stars create a complex symbiotic relationship that lifts "" Mr. Brooks "" several rungs above the ordinary. Mr. Brooks is a first rate thriller that any fan of the genre should enjoy."
6464,"This is by far the funniest, strangest and most ingenious comedy of the summer. There was an obvious (and effective) effort to give each character a real personality, quirks and all. the kind of characters you enjoy watching. Be sure to rent or buy this movie and the extras are pretty awesome. A good performance, a Hilarious Andy Samberg and cast, and the beautiful Isla Fisher is always nice to watch."
6435,"South Orange has become an upscale white collar community ever since 1978 to feature celebrity residents like Kelly Bishop and Andre Braugher. She's instantly likable and she transmits emotions through her face, voice, and body like she was born to convince you of her champion heart. The siblings especially Johnny were casted great as well as Kyle and Peter. But the fact that she nails a shot, on a bet, with bare feet in the opening sequence shows she's got the potential to be a star herself. Stay until the end of the credits, you will be interested to see what it has to say."
6437,"Whilst both leads are magnificent, Loren Horsley is the real find here. Thus the title, the endearing characters, and the difficulty deciding if this is an understated farce about the fringes of society or an exaltation of diversity and simplicity. The multiple story lines involve family relationships, one on ones, self - esteem and self - discovery. Though writer / director Taika Cohen has borrowed a lot of elements from other films working in similar fields, he does so naturally, with a poise, grace, and nerdiness, left out of a lot of the quirky, funny, hip, indie rom - coms. The oddball spirit of the film is embodied in the animal - costume party, for which Jarrod hosts as an eagle and Lily arrives as a shark."
6438,""" 88 Minutes "" is a movie of stunning badness. You will not be blown away but you will be entertained for the hour and 42 minutes it runs. Pacino seems completely uninterested, his dialogues and general acting deprived of the slightest intensity or wit. , filming clichÃ©s (everytime there is a car trip, the car is filmed from above."
6440,"Some characters show up that you don't expect to show up, and also the movies pacing is tremendous. Virgil and Turk are brothers who are experts in everything (they kind of do everything and run everywhere). What can be really enjoyed are the colorful visuals and a bunch of stars that seem to enjoy themselves. Best moments come from Scott Cann and Casey Affleck; most embarrassing from Don Cheadle. The unlucky guy is Willy Banks (Al Pacino) who owns a series of highly rated "" 5 Diamonds "" hotels."
6444,"So what a pleasant surprise to find that Surf's Up is not only a movie that'll appeal to both kids and adults, but also the best animated movie of the year so far! The beauty of the animation itself is enough to make SURF'S UP a serious contender come award season when the waves of praise come crashing ashore. Cody is taken under wing by a former surfer named Geek (Jeff Bridges) once at the competition and their playful interactions keep your gliding through to the finals. The voice talent is perfect: Jeff Bridges as the laid back Z, Shia LaBeouf the young hero in the making, Jon Heder as a stoned chicken from Michigan, and Zooey Deschanel as the good - hearted lifeguard who keeps secrets well. Shia LeBeouf was very good (esp."
6445,"And to all those who claim that this sequel is better than the first one: Shyeah. You get a glimpse of the cosmicness, but the people are the important thing. He looked at the numbers from the first one and assumed that money always equals success. Galactus, in the comics, is a force of nature. They're the only charismatic, interesting and professional energies in this film."
6446,"Eventually, the director has enough control to make it all very palatable to all types of audiences, from the young ones to the adults in the audience. She is still good enough to get boys' attentions but she also knows how present poise and self respect. All clues point to a wonderful movie! The characters are fun to watch, especially the Californians. Taking old collection of stories poses a challenge for the production team, how can this classic character be brought up to date and make it interesting enough to capture a new audience while stirring memories from her former audience."
6448,"Russel is awesome here and has a great way of becoming charming to chilling in a matter of seconds. It is cited, by Tarantino himself, as being a remembrance to the B movies of the 60s and 70s through the guise of Grindhouse cinema. But now he is apparently of the opinion that anything he writes is great and it's far from the truth. It's often perceived that in these films masculinity must be achieved in order to succeed, which in itself is a direct reference to the inspired B movies of Russ Meyer. Stuntman Mike was a potentially interesting anti - hero / villain and Kurt Russell, fine actor that he is, made the most of his role - for the few minutes he's on screen he's the only actor who seems to exhibit anything resembling a personality or feeling - but he is woefully underused and under - developed, and reducing him to a whimpering fool at the end in an apparent attempt to parody the old alpha male tough guy image (which Russell himself wore in earlier, better films) was far from endearing or even funny."
6465,"Claire Danes is fantastic as always. People of all ages will enjoy it. Michelle Pfiefer is making quite a splash with her recent returns to the screen. The critical reaction is kind of blah. In spite of what first impressions may give, it isn't cheesy, corny, tacky, or ridiculous, and is actually highly entertaining and funny."
6453,"At a time when the apologists of accommodation are promoting the lowest common denominator, Moore most of all offers a vision and hope. It's widely known that, despite being one of the richest countries in the world, the states is far from best when it comes to taking care of their own. Among the rare gems here is one of Richard Nixon's taped conversations, in the Oval Office with John Ehrlichman on the eve of Nixon's 1971 law promoting managed care."
6454,"Memorable performances from Andy Nyman playing neurotic fool Howard and straight man Matthew MacFadyen make this a real crowd pleaser. Uncle Alfie is an absolute hoot and script is generally full of some really good gags. Alan Tudyk is hilarious every moment he is on screen. In tribute to Mr. Altman, Mr. Oz also uses an ensemble cast of well known actors by face but not by name. Comedy is edgy enough for teens to enjoy although overall it will probably appeal to slightly older audiences."
6455,"The place holds about 5 , 000 seats and it was packed. These explosive scenes are a seamless composite of fantastic, real world stunt work, and exceptional CGI. Good old stunt work and explosions, thank God. It's superb direction, fantastic acting, groundbreaking special effects and clever quirps will leave you with (almost) nothing to complain about. It delivers action in abundance, and the movie has a great visceral feel to it thanks to great stunt work, and the fact that Willis really steps up in the fight scenes."
6456,"However, the simple appearance of a couple of "" Office "" stars is enjoyable. It's amazing how the wrong lead character can affect everyone and everything around them. License to Wed is neither terrible nor wonderful. The audience was a good mix of older couples, young marrieds, teenage girls, a few stray singles, a family or two--a well - rounded audience, let's say. Mandy Moore and John Krasinski are cute, but very flat characters."
6457,"Evan Almighty is predictable on every turn, and has enough humor to satisfy. It's religious tie - ins (if rushed) are quite smart and it's very well directed visually with a great use of music and keeping a steady pace. Steve Carell does an exceptionally adequate job of delivering very humorous dialogue, which in his style is sure to be adlibbed in great part. It is what's on the label, but with a jaw - droppingly impressive final act which will really take you by surprise and could be up there as one of the sights of the summer! The sheer amounts of animals in this film are overwhelming and a treat to behold."
6488,"Nicely shoot with some great camera movement Wan is shooting stuff to pieces almost like Hong Kong directors did in the early '90s. Kevin Bacon delivers nicely and adds a whole new facet to the dad - on - a-rampage character. As exciting and gripping as this film is, please be fore - warned: the violence shown on screen is not for those with weak stomachs. If you ever wanted to exact revenge on someone in your own mind or in your dreams go see this movie it is great. Mixing revenge and violence with the struggles in the main character's life works well, and the movie never slows down or gets boring."
6458,"They laughed at anything and applauded for everything. The sound effects complement the action perfectly making everything twice as exciting. It's a good thing that the robots do work. And unlike the other blockbusters that have came out this year, these effects have a sense of weight that adds so much to the visual satisfaction. The robot vs. robot fight scenes were, in a word, remarkable."
6459,"Her voice, mannerisms and demeanor were amazing. They have finally achieved the art of saying a lot without necessarily opening their mouths. Kreacher and Grawp were great additions to the films. The thestrals were marvelous--eerie, but strangely peaceful creatures. In this respect, Order of the Phoenix was very similar to the previous two movies."
6460,"And of course Kevin James and Adam Sandler are great. Child actor Cole Morgen is remarkably talented. Some of the scenes were set up really well and the comedy acting was superb. Yet, there are some parts that make you laugh out loud. It seems that with this new comedy duo that Sandler got his magic back."
6461,"The 60's and early 70's were a time of outrageously bold colors and design. Definitely standout performances from Dana Fuchs (who has the most AMAZING voice), Martin Luther, and TV Carpio. All this is rendered through a constant flow Beatles songs delivered amidst magnificent set designs and video composites. Imperfections, however glaring, become endearing quirks once you've tumbled. Taymor fans will definitely appreciate it (it has a lot of her traditional colorful imagery, masks, and puppets)."
6467,"The animation and production values are awesome. The simpsons movie is witty, fast paced, touching, hugely entertaining and most importantly: laugh out loud funny. There were some funny moments, yes, but nothing comparable to the brilliant one - liners from the show's glory years. What made the Simpsons great was its more subtle satire and it at least tried to stay grounded within reality. And if your a simpsons fan who's loved every episode, thats all you'll need from it."
6468,"Overall, the script is basic and mostly predictable with some good tie - ins and closures. The original had poignant moments, perfectly punctuated with an incredible soundtrack. In Mostly Martha, the food came alive - every scene was filmed in such a way you could taste it with your eyes - the smells, the textures. You leave the cinema all warm and fuzzy, and that makes the execution of No Reservations a success. At 38 years old, that is a brave feat indeed (and this courage is consistent with all the flawed characters she likes to play)."
6469,"The gestures and facial expressions are spot on. Generally, it was good and even excelled at some moments. He's confident and anything but vulnerable. He does a beautiful job expressing his character's many and layered emotions. He was a excellent complement for Downey Jr. ."
6470,"Strathairn relishes the role and he too gets some superb scenes in the movie. David Strathairn is a newcomer to this series as Noah Vosen, he's definitely the bad guy of the movie and he really excels. Ramirez is a nice addition to the role that has been successfully played by Clive Owen (Identity), Karl Urban, and Martin Csokas (Supremacy). This film stands far above the other two Bourne movies, and is definitely one of the best movies of the 2007 summer season! His skill at the close - up hand - held look is astonishing and has the same kinetic energy as Tony Scott, but without quite the seizure - inducing cuts."
6471,"For little preschoolers and elementary school girls, this movie rocks. What were you expecting, an intriguing story, deep, heartfelt emotional scenes, from The Bratz movie? And while the film tries to touch on friendships being key, the main message here is that only thin, good - looking people are worth anything; and the only way to make a difference in the world is to wear the latest, most expensive fashions. Yes that's right, according to this guy the film Bratz is a perfect masterpiece with impeccable acting, dialogue and story, backed up by Oscar worthy directing and screenplay. Friends, the combined talent of the entire cast and crew of "" Bratz "" could be put in a thimble and there would still be room for Rosie O'Donnell's butt."
6478,"With all the complexities of the final installments of this years trilogies, this should be a welcome change of pace. Sure, you can see everything coming from a mile away but it still makes you laugh and still entertains. But for a man aged 53 Jackie is still more fast, agile and flexible than most of his much younger co-stars. This one seems to have plenty of more laughs and an even more exiting climax towards the end of the movie than the previous two. The chemistry between the two leads is still there which makes these movies fun in the first place."
6473,"Everything out of his mouth is carefully orchestrated and he is not one to waste his own or others' time. As for that sassy woman, TÃ©a Leoni is perfect in the part. The movie is very funny with many laughs. The who's who of supporting players also does a nice job anchoring the story. This fact makes some scenes hilarious because of the reactions from those he is speaking to."
6476,"They are extremely likable in many ways. The beer aspects were pretty cool, and the sexual jokes did their thing. It had its completely gross - out teen moments, but those were grounded by its hilariously absurd and witty (also gross) conversations. This movie is one of the funniest of the 21st century. Also ,' McLovin' Fogell, is an absolute nerdy delight."
6477,"Movie gives a good look at the different perspectives of the period. The plot itself has its ups and downs, but is ultimately satisfying. Overall the acting is solid and on the money, again with Cheadle and Ejiofor showing deft acting chops with versatility of drama and comedy. Chiwetel Ejiofor also makes a notable appearance as Dewey Hughes, who becomes Greene's manager. Perhaps this, one of his best roles to date, will change perspectives overall."
6623,"This film is an example of an extremely strong narrative accompanied by excellent cinematography and superbly executed war scenes. There seems to be a great deal of research that has gone into the subject and is a great eduction on the early life of Chengiz Khan. The first installment of a prospective trilogy, Mongol chronicles the early life of Temudjin, from his childhood on the Asian steppe to his ascension to Khan in 1206. The few combat scenes were filmed and choreographed to great effect. Sergei Bodrov's Mongol provides something of a biography of the early years of Genghis Khan, at this point known as Temudjin."
6479,"Balls of Fury was quite funny! Balls of Fury really did a great job of keeping in the same humor vein of Reno 911, etc. . A lot of the humor is based in uncomfortable moments. You may laugh or smile at some scenes. It's an interesting concept that probably contains about ten minutes of solid comedic material."
6480,"The cinematography was quite lovely in many spots. overall, a very entertaining 100 plus minutes. Bynes' and him have good chemistry and he does a great job in the role for what he's given. Amanda Bynes as the leading performer in this movie is phenomenal. Her facial expressions makes the movie 10 times better."
6481,"After all, the makers apparently did want to make some kind of statement and this last comment really hits home. There are a few surprises, some forensic elements and the flick bears some resemblance to Syriana, that was a well done film. The gripping opening montage documents the connection between the U. S. A. and Saudi Arabia and sucks you right into the story. The movie goes way over the top from this moment on and turns into something Jerry Bruckheimer might have thought up. Instead, once the FBI turn up, these two get relegated to standing to one side and looking suitably impressed every time one of the names - above - the - title stars does something brilliant."
6482,"The strongest aspects were the performances from the entire cast with Anna Kendrick and Vincent Piazza being standouts. The crew did a most convincing job of turning South East Baltimore into Trenton, NJ and turning the suburbs of MD into those of NJ. Which is quite rare not only in movies, but in life really. But this deeply personal film has many fine moments, both hysterically funny and painfully revealing. One of last years best scripts and a breakout performance from the natural Reece Thompson ensures Rocket Science is up on 2007's biggest sleepers list."
6483,"Some of the "" funny "" parts were the cleaning up of the camp. It's always so funny to see someone fall through a roof while hammering or cleaning up a nasty bathroom. An excellent actor who has never made it big, Gant almost manages to make his scenes work. Along the way, he must resolve problems with his father and show his son that he really loves him. And most important, movie is not stupid and has some moral thoughts."
6484,"If your not a fan or have never seen any other versions you might think it is OK. To create a world in which everyone is equal, rational, no war, no disease, no famine, no inequality is what the body snatchers are offering. That's actually moving and seldom seen in a macho - dominated Hollywood. It had two big stars, an acclaimed director, a big time producer, and a time tested premise. Inserted into the original movie at close intervals to keep people amused (or so they thought)."
6485,"Atwell inspires strong performances from Jason Statham and Jet Li. In real life, FBI agents have a lot more class. There's even one with motorcycles. The martial arts as choreographed by Corey Yuen ("" Transporter "" movies) are exquisite, and acknowledge for its variety. "" War "" is a solid action movie with great performances from Jason Statham and Jet Li."
6486,""" The Nanny Diaries "" is entertaining the entire time. It had great acting, a solid story, and whiles not being original had its own unique charms that makes it a very enjoyable movie. She's not featured an awful lot in the movie, but the small doses of her are well acted. But it is quite refreshing to see Paul Giamatti, after appearing in so many endearing roles ("" Sideways "", "" Lady in the water "" and even "" Cinderella man ""), portray a totally disgusting character. "" The Nanny Diaries "" is absolutely mandatory viewing for Scarlett Johansson fans."
6487,"One of the most significant updates to the "" Halloween "" legend is the development of Dr. Loomis, the Van Helsing to Meyers' Dracula. It makes the "" Texas Chainsaw "" remakes look like spun, celluloid gold. The best moments come early, between young Michael and his mother (both played very well). There are some good performances, particularly by Malcolm McDowell, who plays Dr. Loomis, but his part is profoundly damaged by the script, so even he looks foolish in the film. Everyone speaks leftover dialogue from THE DEVIL'S REJECTS, and what worked for those characters fails miserably for these."
6489,"It is a journey that takes you through the darker and seedier side of the video game revolution of the '80s. This is an incredible documentary, and as with most great documentaries the story arises as the filming happens; it is not preconceived. The story of these people, especially steve's, are really inspiring and you find yourself feeling all of the twists and turns of the film along with the characters. The mock - epic tone, which so many supporting characters delightfully contribute to, feels seized by director Seth Gordon and infused into his charming take on good - vs - evil, letting this potentially inspiring metaphor stretch it's wings into a blossomed, well - rounded quirk-fest far more fun then it's rigorous gaming pedigree would suggest. A truly wonderful film about human beings not just donkey kong."
6491,"It was wonderfully exciting and filled with great action parts, hilarious tongue - in - cheek humor, and non-stop entertainment. There are also some really funny cuts, dialog and special effects. The cast that Rodriguez assembled is a glorious ensemble of bygone action heroes, horror icons, and Rodriguez stock actors. From the exploitative opening credits through to the final frames of the film, this is a roller coaster ride of a film that doesn't let up. While the uncut DVD edition of Planet Terror doesn't change the film drastically in any way, it definitely improves the film."
6492,"Talk about art imitating life, Crowe is pretty much flawless as the intelligent but amoral Wade. Cinematically, this film ranks up there with the best westerns of all time. Then you can praise the movie to high heaven, feel you have done your penance, and content yourself with the ingenuity of your expansive insights. That's largely due to the outstanding performances by the cast, ably led by the alpha male, bad guy, Russell Crowe. If you like westerns you'll love this."
6493,"That being said, the gunfights and car chases are stellar. It's the funniest, coolest, most amazing mix of stunts, bad one liners and paper think plot lines. This film was so fun and yes over the top, but if you expect anything more you probably will be disappointed. Paul Giamatti is a sinister delight and able to match Owens one - liner for one - liner. The shootings are fast and impossible but actually hilarious in the choreography."
6495,"Everything about this part of the film is brilliant. What works is that you think what you're seeing is real, and everything in every frame of that scene. Superb performances, beautiful direction, a script and storyline to die for. She has improved massively since the first pirates film. The dramatic quality of the film is heightened with different events are replayed from different perspectives to show what something has the appearance of being, and what it really is."
6496,"Winnipeg; heart of the heart of Canada, the place that raised Maddin. Wow, she is in her mid 80's and she agreed to do this role. This film has everything that is appealing about Maddin's work as well as a new richness that he'd never quite found before. Like the bizarre and amusing experiments of an eccentric than anything of real value (although obviously that is debatable). "" There is something universal about the film, Maddin incants a litany of opprobrium and indignity that the city of Winnipeg has suffered, from the demolition of an iconic department store, to the closure of two underground swimming pools and the hockey stadia."
6497,"There are many memorable scenes in this film. Anamaria Marinca is superb in the role of Otilia. Everything that was in the movie was well thought and planned. Creativity and originality can add untold dimensions to any physical limitations and barriers. Great acting, great directing, great filming, great writing and a great story make this film well worthy of those Palmes D'Or."
6498,"But what most matters is what people have to say, and Ferguson has assembled some key talking heads. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld comes across as a glib conductor of public relations as things descend into chaos and the viewer will be left with the impression he was not merely inept, but a blithering idiot. Many good people, administrators, military etc. speak out in this movie and give a chilling view of the ineptitude and arrogance of George Bush and co. . But as this excellent new documentary shows, things went wrong for reasons â€” because of how the war was planned and executed."
6500,"This film is such a moving masterpiece on so many levels it is simply wonderful to watch. At the heart of it is Haggis's quietly powerful directing style and the cast's powerfully quiet performances. Paul Haggis has an uncanny way of bringing out great performances from all of his actors. Although there may be a few too many twists and lies circling about, it comes to its conclusion very well in a satisfying way for the audience. Instead of going for simple emotional tugs that he did with "" Crash, "" this film focuses on its understated performances, namely from Tommy Lee Jones, who is superb in this film."
6501,"And Paul Rudd stamps his charm all over this. It does have the beautiful Michelle Pheifer and hilarious Paul Rudd in it! ) The chemistry between Michelle Pheifer and Paul Rudd was spot on. There are definite moments that will take you back to that classic! Other notable fine performances are give by the one and only Tracey Ullman as Mother Nature, and Saoirse Ronan as Pfeiffer's daughter."
6502,"Kangaroo Island is absolutely stunning and from the dusty outback to the crystal clear coast, the visual splendour is a feast for the eyes. This was a bold movie by Hollywood's standards. a feel good movie thats enjoyable to watch. That something is the engaging performances of the two major boys - Daniel Radcliffe and Lee Cormie. Radcliffe has notably excelled further since this film was made over two years ago."
6503,"Its probably three quarters of one of the most enjoyable films of the year (even with the nastiness . ) That's due mainly to sterling performances from Gere, reinvigorates after The Hoax, and Howard, showing a comic side after the intensity of' Crash' Jesse Eisenberg also looks like this role was written for him personally, and the remaining cast are appropriate. And his co-star is a fine actor. The crisp, realistic docu - direction, mainstreamed by Paul Greengrass, has exerted its influence and fits neatly into this film without looking forced. Secondly, there is nothing in this film that truly educates the viewer about the horrors of what happened there."
6504,"And even at its dullest moments, it works excellently. Some real edge of your seat moments in this instant classic. Naomi Watts brings the heart to the proceedings without ever being sentimental. The acting in Eastern Promises is uniformly excellent. Eastern Promises is a really good film with and extraordinary Viggo Mortensen at its very core."
6508,"There are some great scenes here and some pretty fun kills, not a whole lot that you haven't seen before, but still entertaining. The predecessors were horror movies with great action. In all honestly, all three movies disgrace the name of Resident Evil. If you are going to see this movie because you are a hard core fan of the game since the mid nineties when resident evil first came out. And like a video game, all levels will lead to their respective Big Boss to do battle with, and Extinction doesn't evade that formula too."
6509,"Keep your expectations low and you'll enjoy' Good Luck Chuck . ' The only funny moments seem to be when Dane is improvising. As romantic comedies go, "" Good Luck Chuck "" isn't bad. Cook and Alba do good jobs with a paper - thin script and add some great moments with the physical humor such as the flying dental tools and jump starting Dane Cook as seen in the trailer. Sad to say there were only a few really memorable funny parts to the movie though."
6510,"The relationships seemed real and human. Hal Holbrook, Brian Dierker, and Catherine Keener are by far the best of these side characters with Vince Vaughn and Kirsten Stewart adding some charm too. The sensitivity with which Krakauer captured the essence of McCandless and his adventure is extended aptly to the movie format by Sean Penn. . All the supporting players are magnificent at helping show the side to McCandless that Penn needs on display to succeed. But Penn gets a terrific performance out of him as well as Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn, Wm. Hurt, Kirsten Stewart, jena Malone and everyone else for that matter."
6511,"Disney actually branched out with something different and gave it a wonderful cast. The supporting cast of football players was well done. Pettis was amazing, as was Kyra Sedgwick. Definitely a must - see family film and certainly a DVD buy! It's one of those movies you look forward to seeing and it doesn't disappoint."
6512,"The cinematography, costumes, scenery, etc. were all first rate. There were also some lighthearted moments sprinkled throughout the film, which had an excellent score to accompany it. Steeped in the historically and culturally turbulent period of the second Sino - Japanese War, one must applaud Ang Lee for the dizzying array of minutiae he oversaw as director. It is a film set in Asia, by an Asian filmmaker, with a special resonance for Asian moviegoers. The global combination achieved the great technical support besides the compelling story and the feast of performances."
6513,"Above all it is quintessentially English and far from being dated it is a timeless masterpiece as relevant to children now as 30 years ago. The secret of success is in the way it creates magic not out of stereotyped wizards (a la Harry Potter), but out of the honest descriptions of the events that unfold for Will Stanton. How is this for a financial idea: Susan Cooper wrote a 5 book masterpiece that works for kids and adults alike. After such great adaptations as LotR, Narnia and the Potter books to see this classic ruined was a sad sight. So, to make a film that changes characters as significantly as this does, omitting some, radically altering others, changing the whole substance of Will's family is unforgivable."
6514,"This film is great, has a lot of funny moments, terrific cast and a rocking soundtrack. Stiller, Akerman, and Monaghan did put their heart into their commendable comedic performances. Ben Stiller is great, Malin Akerman is superb, there are scenes and ideas that are brilliant, the ending is pitch perfect, yet everything else is just so poorly executed! Also many, many great performances by actors in supporting roles. Deinitely not one of Stiler's, or the Farrelly Brother's best work to date."
6515,"The emotions between them where very realistic and sweet. It also knows that anyone who might be feeling lonely on any given day or for months at a time needs to be reminded that surprises still happen. The Dan from the title is Dan Burns (Steve Carell), an advice columnist who is admired for his insight into living a balanced, fulfilling and morally uplifting life. "" Dan in Real Life "" is witty and has fun, intelligent laughs throughout. If you've seen Steve Carell in The Office or Little Miss Sunshine, you'd know that he is incomparable with comedic timing and a tremendously dynamic actor as well."
6516,"Through the spaces between people, as well as within India. A stroll through various imaginative carts, occupied by compartments of colorful characters and incidents. He's trying to push the medium forward in terms of tone. Also, a couple of funny moments in the feature wouldn't make much sense without seeing the short. However, despite the bright, new and fantastically shot environment and the well - cast new member of the Anderson family, The Darjeeling Limited is what has become a typical Wes Anderson film."
6517,"There are several scenes in which his reactions are stunning in their realism. Gray creates real mood in several particularly excellent scenes. And it has a couple of great action scenes. The move is filled with some very tense moments and excellent performances by Joaquin Phoenix, Mark Wahlberg, Robert Duvall and Eva Mendes. There are three different hallways used at different intervals in the film that are wonderfully atmospheric (as coupled with haunting audio and skillful direction) and indicative of a passage into the unknown."
6518,"On the plus side the sets and costumes are magnificent. Blanchett's Queen is youngish and attractive. The somber settings work beautifully to support and give intensity to the horrifying scenes and moments. The sets, costuming, and period speech are all mastered well, creating a true feel for the era being depicted. "" The Golden Age "" is a very handsome film, with superb production, and some spectacular costumes, exquisitely worn by Ms. Blanchett."
6519,"But the screenplay cleverly contrasts high - intensity scenes and well - developed characters. And the overheard phrase, "" The time is now, "" brings everything together in the present. But as a suspense thriller, it's possibly the best one of the year or even in years. Michael Clayton is a thriller that works at a slower pace, but still manages to enthrall with its developments. If you can provide that, then it is a film experience that will provide some rewards."
6520,"Its a very very good movie, and definitely worth seeing in theaters. The film is full of wonderful performances from everyone. Anyone who sees this movie will be pleasantly surprised. The real guilty fun starts once Bianca is delivered. The first thirty minutes of the film are pretty damn funny and to some, almost hilarious."
6521,"With her endearing little girl face and keen talent for playing it straight under the most fantastic of circumstances, she's likable, sympathetic and totally believable in this role. The vampires were made very good, they really looked scary! "" 30 Days of Night "" is a very welcome addition to the ranks of vampire movies. Yes, there are some missteps with the film's pacing and some huge leaps of logic in the amount of time that passes between events. The setting is fantastic and what could be more scary than 30 days of endless night when you are besieged by vampires."
6522,All of them gave engaging performances as well. All the performances in the film are superb. A must - see film of the year and a pleasant surprise coming from Ben Affleck. Ben Affleck has proved that he can direct a movie with the best of them. Ben Affleck seems to be very creative and knows how to get your attention right when he want you to.
6523,"Someone mentioned that the film was being touted as Trainspotting shot in Canada with laughs. The music is pretty cool too - The Dears is in it, so is The Constantines and Shout Out Out Out Out, it's about frigging time somebody started using cool Canadian bands in a movie. Allan Moyle, the director of 1990's Pump Up the Volume, directs another tale of disaffected youth featuring a pair of junkies as an entertaining double act, Royce and Dexter (Wes Bentley and Scott Speedman). By turns genuinely engaging and laugh out loud funny, Weirdsville is daft but brilliant. But Moyle adds enough of his own visual exuberance to defy unflattering comparisons and his hallucinogenic effects lend extra scope to the irreverent caper humour."
6524,"Also a great score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is a possibility along with great costumes by Patricia Norris and perfect art direction by Janice Blackey - Goodine. The score also fits the tone for the most of the scenes. In the films most horrific scenes, the music turns them into something beautiful. Oscar worthy performances from Affleck, Pitt, and Rockwell - Oscar worthy cinematography - Oscar worthy directing. Paul Schneider, Jeremy Renner and Garret Dillahunt all turn in exceptional performances and enhance a cast of big name stars."
6525,"She holds her own and maintains her dignity despite the circumstances she finds herself in. This film is a cut above so many bigger releases. Both Marianne and Miki sparkles the screen with their historic. Her hesitations, her doubts, her fears, her joy, her confidence, her love, and her grandiose â€“ everything is perfect. All in all a well worth the trip out but as its now playing at Art house cinemas might be a little bit tricky to find."
6526,"And yes, there is the occasional neat movie reference (Rocky III being the most memorable one). And the extra layer of poignancy derives from the fact that co-director Marjane Satrapi experienced every single event in the film. Persepolis, on the other hand, deals with adult themes in a serious, unpretentious way. By telling of her own experiences it really is extremely easy to see how so much of it is common to a whole generation of Iranians. The most memorable of the side characters though, would have to be Marjane's grandmother."
6527,"Watch it for the cool visuals, for the tall, soulful Sam Riley, and for the terrific live performance scenes. Control covers a period from his schooldays to his end in 1980 (aged 23). He is surrounded by a great cast but the film is carried on Riley's shoulders. It is a credit to the actors that they played everything live on screen, it serves to create memorable performances. There are some very clever and touching uses of the music in the film."
6528,"This is a lovely film about the friends and relationships that make human existence bearable. If the characters are archetypes, they are necessarily so and once understood become more powerful in their abstraction. Her ability to create characters one can believe and sympathize with on all levels? when the film tries to stay "" loyal "", in many occasions it is nothing but a poor shadow of the original book. The strength of this movie is that even if you have a tough time with that conceit, you will still enjoy the humor of it, and the strong performances."
6529,"The leads do a commendable job, but most importantly, their chemistry undeniably believable. Hanna Schygulla, especially, offers a stunning performance, but the rest of the ensemble is also very impressive. as it turns out finding someone in a foreign country is not that easy, and as such there are many emotions and surprises involved. Some dark and bleak moments are also well - done. This quest even brings her to the shores of Istanbul, a city where East meets West in the most literal way."
6530,"If you actually go and see it without judging it too fast then chances are you will enjoy it. The comedic, yet dramatic, performances by the actors was quite impressive. Definitely a good rent when it comes out on DVD. Despite some of these often repeated mistakes (not just here but in other movies) this movie was very very good. The intensity of the issues raised at the dinner table that night was HUGE, and with everything being exposed so quickly at one time made it that much more intense."
6554,"For starters, this is a very unique film. It was a fun watch, but overall the story is really shallow, it's purely focused on Faris and her misadventures that day. Some ideas are actually cool and the Manifesto is perfectly handed out in the end. The thought process was incredibly accurate, the physical effects, everything. It's interesting, as most of the time the filming style is bright and clear, rather than dark or "" tripped out "" like so many other drug movies."
6531,"The details are superb; everything clicked and was managed well. At this point, it appears as if Darren Bousman is going through the motions, and that's what keeps the series spirit alive. As long as Bousman, Wan, or Whannell continue to be involved, the spirit should live on. Hopefully it'll have more extra footage than the others. If you liked the first Saws, then you will not want to miss this one."
6534,"The documentary benefits from having begun before the 60 Minutes coverage, when the authenticity of Marla's work is unquestioned. The story of what the family went through as the result of the hatchet job by 60 Minutes ultimately makes the film a far more interesting one than it would have been otherwise. The interwoven presentation of each of these stories (i. e. girl, family, art) provides a captivating multi-layered effect that holds the viewers' attention throughout. At the same time, they will look you in the eye and honestly tell you something is "" art, "" like the neon sign in this movie that just has the words - "" F--k "" on it. he does appear shifty and one has to believe that he is certainly capable of doing the enhancements."
6535,"It's aimed at the heart, and touches the emotions. There is an inspired moment when Dennis and David gaze above at the stars. The film jumps right into things and doesn't really take a lot of pit stops. Both leading actors portray their characters perfectly and work so amazingly well together that their performances are seamless. This movie was perhaps one of his best films and most satisfying performances since "" Say Anything . """
6537,"Though Im not gonna be saying it's the best film of the year or anything like that. There are scenes when you know he's gonna say it, and he still pulls it off incredibly well. Without giving away more, it and the following scenes lead to some surprising moral and character statements by Scott. They play off each other perfectly and it's well worth the build - up, and maybe are among the highlights of each performance. Sure there are other good scenes, done well, but nothing worth mentioning."
6574,"The cinematography, set designs, costumes, and makeup are all striking. In a year of brilliant opuses by the Cohen Brothers and PT Anderson, this Tim Burton film shines as the best from every angle. He successfully creates a much more intimate atmosphere than can be achieved on stage, with characters up - close and personal, and he makes brilliant use of light / dark contrasts and color. A very refreshing return to the realms and themes that Tim Burton is so very amazing at capturing. Despite the grim expectations from the story synopsis, the film delivers gore in a surprisingly tasteful way."
6538,"Some of the bee hive interior and flight scenes were just breathtaking. Where the movie scores its biggest points lies in the fast - paced, unpredictable humor of Jerry Seinfeld. The laughs are few and far between. The connection of a talking bee with a human girlfriend was too ludicrous to be entertaining, as were the courtroom scenes. Does anything feel better than laughing?"
6539,"Otherwise, this film is pretty darn close to perfect. Hoffman was at his very best and some of his scenes with Hawke were positively electric. The film has a good level of intensity, in part thanks to the performances and, in part, thanks to the brilliant screenplay. The screenplay does its part, and of course Lumet does his part, but at the film's dramatic center are three masterful actors who deliver incredibly good performances. Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is a real masterpiece with perfect direction, a great screenplay and excellent performances."
6540,"The female leads were all equally impressive as they were beautiful. The fantastic capture of real eye angle camera movements from the vision of Jean is incredibly real. This film deserves all the accolades that it has received in a story which is spellbinding and emotional. It makes the challenge facing Bauby a global one and relevant to everyone's life. The lighting and photography enhance the film, and the faces of the French women are wondrous to behold as the story unfolds on the screen."
6541,"Beautifully shot, as you would expect, and with some (welcome) moments of humour amongst the gore, this is a very very fine film. Javier Bardem gives the best performance of his career. Watching him on screen is a jolt to the heart, and will go down as one of the best performances of the decade. Roger Deakins' cinematography is breathtaking as usual and the Coens' script is superbly crafted. But Chigurh is unconventional at best; he also happens to be bordering on mentally insane."
6543,"It speaks volumes about the lengths people will go to' have someone'. Everyone else that follows - Burt and Linda's friends and associates - are almost as riveting. She wasn't that easy, albeit he was pretty rich as a lawyer / movie producer, and had all sorts of nifty objects. With an abundance of photos and film clips - along with songs popular at the time playing on the soundtrack - Klores is able to bring the various eras in which this all took place to vivid life. But, obviously, his key selling point is the numerous interviews he was able to glean with people intimately connected to the story - including Burt and Linda themselves."
6544,"A trio of beautiful performances form the heart of this film, although the secondary characters are also crisply compelling. The three main characters are all physically "" beautiful "" people who manage to convey the story with a minimum of dialog. At its end, the film received claps, cheers and shouts of approval by the majority of the audience. The child actors were terrific, especially Freddie Highmore whose facial expressions alone carried more emotion than any screenwriter's words could. The actors playing Agust Rush / Evan Taylor and his mother and father were amazingly well cast."
6546,"If not the "" best "" science - fiction film ever made, Jerome Bixby's Man From Earth is certainly one of the most thoughtful. Directer was great and most off all. Excellent ensemble performances created believably real characters, each with his or her own fallibilities, personal credo, and enthusiasms. All though it did not cost tens of millions to put to film, it is a winner in any category. It goes to show that you can make great films these days without explosions and killings."
6547,"These miscues keep it from perfection. To summarise briefly, the movie consists of essentially 3 scenes; a senator's office in DC (representing the establishment), a college professor's office in California (representing the liberal element) and a mountain top in Afghanistan (representing active engagement). Lions for Lambs is a current issue film that deals with several relevant topics. While it tries to be a simple, get - out - and - do - something message picture, its high - wattage stars light up and steal the screen. In fact, it has no clearcut, simple answers to offer to a damningly complex situation full of contradictions as it actually is."
6548,"The depth of vision you get is truly breathtaking in parts. So, its a violent special effects triumph - could anything be wrong? Leave your serious head (and any timid youngsters) at home, and go and have fun. As for the 3D, apart from an awesome intro, nothing seems to be done just to exploit 3D, it's all very natural and adds an amazing level of detail to the movie. There are lots of beautifully constructed tracking shots where the camera glides and swirls forward, back up and down, and trees, rocks, arrows, dragons or whatever slip past the edges of the frame, and this effect is stunning in 3D."
6549,"The cast played their parts well, and the mechanics of the movie were good --- nice colours, nice sets. Thoroughly enjoyable story, characters, and humor. It has a wonderful sense of magic about it and very good solid performances from the leads. Whether you have kids or not, if you are in the mood for something light yet meaningful, check this out. Some of the most moving moments in the film were created by little more than the expression on his face."
6552,"This film aims to bring you close to whats going on, and on many levels it succeeds. Filled with both hope and heartbreak, "" Darfur Now "" is a fit companion piece to "" The Devil Came on Horseback, "" an equally compelling documentary on the same topic. Just listening to the words of refugees in Darfur makes a great difference. That aside, Darfur Now is another addition to the growing ranks of quality documentaries that are playing out these days. Much more interesting was the story from the people actually in Darfur and also Ocampo in his attempts to bring those responsible to justice, but also this part of the story is skimmed over."
6553,"Excellent on - screen chemistry and fantastic visual effects. Not fair, it's brilliant and better than anything Kevin Smith has done for a decade. This award - winning movie is 90 minutes well - spent. ; a brilliant reference to "" The Warriors "" and a Horror mask that becomes reality. There's many surprises & laugh out loud moments."
6555,"Frank Darabont's adaptation of Stephen King's novella goes heads above a 50s / 60s monster movie homage. Darabont has added some elements not found in the King story, but each one of them is spot on. From the opening scene, Darabont sets a tone that's creepy, sinister and beautifully judged. This lends to the great atmosphere and tension Darabont builds. Masterfully written screenplay (from the original short story by Stephen King) and masterfully directed, anyone who is generally sceptical about adaptations of Stephen King "" horrors "" will be rewarded by watching this, Frank Darabont has done a typically marvelous job (see Shawshank and Green Mile) and well and truly delivered."
6556,"The over-acting is great and the culture shock fantastic. , spectacular music numbers that have charm, and the fact that it is suitable for all ages. Complete with its pop - up book bookends, Enchanted is truly magical. The message is good, the songs are good, the animation and acting are good â€” Disney came through with this one. So, if you are looking for a way to spend a couple hours with the whole family, Enchanted is definitely a great way to go."
6557,"Not a perfect adaptation, but the best so far compared to others out there. Timothy Olyphant does a surprisingly good job of portraying him too. Several unique scenes of bloodshed find their way into Hit - man, and as expected the body count reaches an impressive sum. The fight scenes with the other assassins from the Agency are also very well done and quite a treat to see. It is entertaining to the general audience who has not plaid the video game, by use of witty remarks, dark humor, and excellent action scenes."
6558,"And what a great ending to make you feel you so got your moneys worth. Hayden Christensen and Lena Olin are awesome and electrifying as they elevate "" Awake "". There were some macabrely funny moments and some nice twists. The cast is excellent, leaded by the still gorgeous Lena Olin, Terrence Howard, Jessica Alba and Hayden Christensen. Terrence Howard is always good, Jessica Alba actually turns in a very decent performance, and Hayden Christensen is Annakin Skywalker as a billionaire."
6559,"Somehow in the fantasy realm, studios have seen giant dollar signs over the heads of young children and grasped for material with a previously established audience that appeals to this demographic. Such an enhanced cut would fill in a lot of the details of this world, more fully develop the scenes and characters, and truly give a feeling of being part of the adventure, instead of just watching it. Kidman makes her multi-layered and highly memorable, her best scenes definitely being towards the end. It is certainly unlike anything you've ever seen: so very good and yet so very, very unsatisfactory. Her cockney accent surprisingly works and never gets too irritating, although at first it takes some adjusting too, and her emotions throughout the film are very well displayed."
6560,"* End Spoilers * There were definitely some great parts, the cinematography was fantastic and the computer generated scenes of a dilapidated and "" uninhabited "" New York were amazing. "" Legend "" overall is one of the better movies of 2007 and a must see. The movie creates a fantastic atmosphere of post-apocalyptic New York and requires your patience as Will Smith's character begins to unravel as the monsters around him begin to become more aggressive and intelligent. The clips in the trailers for the movie were good, but you really have to see the full panoply of close - up shots, distance shots, etc to really appreciate the sheer scale of what this movie is depicting. The action / suspense scenes coupled with superb sound direction were also heart pounding and unexpected which added to the "" scare "" factor."
6561,"The characteristic of each of the chipmunks has been created very carefully, and it is consistence through out the film. Where Alvin and the Chimpmunks succeeds where movies such as Garfield and Scooby Doo have failed is the fact it succeeds in the comedy department. Overall Alvin and the Chimpunks is a surprisingly good movie that is definitely something parents should take their kids to see this Christmas. Alvin is a great lead and has some brilliant moments. The three leads themselves, Alvin, Simon and Theodore if you've never seen the Chipmunks before, are all very likable and have some hilarious moments."
6562,"The best part of the series is arguably that the episodes were compact, neat, quick witted and very well packaged. The first of four Futrama DVDs gets a lot of things right. It's a great funny and fantastic return for Futurama. This is easily the most in depth Futurama story to date. Its literally a celebration of all of the five seasons aired on television, and its impressive that they did this without repeating anything."
6563,"All three turn in great performances. Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jack Black, as well as the rest of the cast, also deliver excellent performances. Kidman and Leigh (Baumbach's wife) are both marvelous as they walk the very tightly wound lines of their borderline personalities. The script is really sharp with many subtle references and the performances are all very impressive. The movie is brittle but never coarse and seldom vulgar; it has a great, wounded heart and very perceptive ears and eyes for passive - aggressive arguments and multi-layered misunderstandings."
6564,"With an astounding ensemble the performances are flawless. It should be mentioned that all of the performances are really top - notch, nobody falls short. Blanchett's in contrast are, of course, the most conventionally straightforward. Cate Blanchett is getting a lot of buzz for her performance, and she deserves it. One of almost unbelievable occurrences that when whispered about long enough become carefully set in stone."
6565,"The rest of the cast does well under Ms. Jenkins' direction. The three performances are all great for their own reasons. "" The Savages "" is one of the best films of 2007! It features three of the year's finest performances from Laura Linney, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Phillip Brosco, all of whom radiate on the screen as real, ordinary but complex, people. Everyone Wendy and Jon meet looks right for the role--nurses, psychologists, administrators, aides, students, etc., etc. ."
6566,"A lot better than most other sequels in regards to similar movies like Jeepers Creepers 2, The Ring 2, The Grudge 2, Hills have eyes II, etc. . Actually, this was a fun horror movie, you didn't even need to see the first one to get it, that was a bonus that not too many sequels give the chance for. However, this film is surprisingly good, having more gore and originality in the deaths than the usual; and works, hooking the attention of the viewer until the very last scene. One of those moments that if you're watching it at the cinema, you'll burst out laughing, feel embarrassed for a second or two before you realising everybody else has done exactly the same. Usually with these movies you can tell exactly who is going to die and in what order, but Wrong Turn 2 still managed to seem fresh."
6567,"Working from refined "" less is more "" psychological horror templates, Bayona delivers the formulaic goods. BelÃ©n Rueda, is a completely credible character and the place where the story has been shot helps make it realistic or, at least, the viewer gets into the environment created. The backbone of the film is undoubtedly the strong performance by BelÃ©n Rueda as Laura, who carries the entire film admirably. The film looks great, with stunning photography and very elegant sets and a gorgeous building standing in for the orphanage itself. Juan Antonio Bayona and writer Sergio G. Sanchez have delivered something really special for their first feature."
6568,"J. K. Simmons and Allison Janney did a nice turn as Juno's parents. The public is buying into it, falling for it and just contributing to the further stupification and ignorance of everyone. During a funky, kick azz opening title sequence, Juno is on her way to the pharmacy. "" Juno "" faces the downside of any independent film that unexpectedly finds itself ripped from the confines of the art houses and suddenly duking it out at the multiplexes with all those high - budget, high - octane, testosterone - laden blockbusters - namely the risk of over-inflated expectations. Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman were great as the adoptive parents who, while seemingly the perfect suburban couple on the outside, have their own sets of issues on the inside."
6569,"They report profoundly different views on a typeface. The effect of showing the ubiquitous use of this font in cities around the world, with people walking by, buses, taxis, and cars whizzing past, etc. all set to a totally perfect music was wonderful. A visit to favorite graphic designs of years past. Helvetica screened this week at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX where it was very well - received. Some are elegant and clean, many are torn old posters, ragged pieces of letters peeling off walls, etc. ."
6570,"Morgan gives an equally touching performance as C. Chambers. Even more impressive is the pacing of the early hospital scenes. Despite these comparisons, The Bucket List is wholesome entertainment that will certainly bring director Rob Reiner back into the spotlight, especially after his unpropitious previous project, "" Rumor Has It The performances of this movie was phenomenal, but what really made this movie unique was the writing. The film is uplifting and heartwarming, and while the conclusion strives for unpredictability, comparisons may be drawn to similarly crafted works."
6571,"It has captured the minds and imagination of millions all across the globe. The entire act is so touching that it cannot but wet your eyes. The scenes between him and Baba were especially touching. But the way Mr. Forster handled the delicate subject was touching and really, deeply moving. As a matter of fact, it won the Academy Award for best picture and several other Oscars."
6572,"The astute viewer will find all the cracks in the plot line of this supposed' startling thriller' from the first few frames: watching suspicions play out is very anticlimactic. It's taut, suspenseful, edge of your seat storytelling combined with good solid performances by all, especially Bello and Brosnan. when she has plenty of ops to do so and behaves remarkably calm and collected under some extremely unnerving situations. It has its feet on the ground and its eyes on what's human and real. It has marvelous actors playing colorful characters in a gripping storyline."
6575,"A bigger story and better action help make Book of Secrets a surprising end of the year crowd pleaser. National Treasure: Book of Secrets is a decent film. What goes wrong here is the whole mentality that sequels need to be bigger and better. Book of Secrets is assuredly no different, keeping audiences on their toes and tantalizing them with conspiracy theories that will likely continue the franchise forward. But it provides a convenient segue to a sequel around page 47 of the book of secrets."
6576,"Lewis gives what is easily, EASILY the best performance of the past five years. Here, perfectly in his element and at his best, Lewis could go toe to toe with Brando and Kinski, playing a part that oozes enough skill and pathos to earn him a place among Hollywood's, and perhaps the world's, greatest performances of all time. The young man who plays H. W. Plainview was also very solid. Some big words and shoes for a film to fit. Robert Elswit beautifully captures the essence of the environment and the tension amongst the characters."
6577,"Everything is so casual and at the same time so directly responsible for so many people's lives. Charlie is beautifully portrayed by Tom Hanks in a solid, slightly understated fashion that is among his best work in years. Virtuoso performances and remarkably memorable characters teamed with a riotously sarcastic script catapult the film, helmed by the continuously unpredictable Mike Nichols, to the top of the year's best. The film is full of entertaining & amusing set ups and cracking dialogue in some of the most unexpected places. The script is the star of this film, and the word - smithing by Aaron Sorkin is some of the best on offer this year."
6578,"Thinking of great new lines for the general audience to remember years down the line - that was more difficult. If this was to be on Earth, in Colorado of all places, they needed to make it realistic. They butted heads awhile and came up with a truly award - winning screenplay equipped with clichÃ© characters, idiotic decisions an gaping plot holes. This is a film that has a complete disregard for its predecessors, it breaks some of the most fundamental rules of a sequel and in doing so one gets the feeling that it is trying to set itself up as a stand alone feature. After that, that crap-fest finally gets to the point where the Predator starts attacking the Aliens, or at least pretends doing so."
6579,"The performances are very good as well. Of course, listening to the lyrics is part of the fun. Literally one of the funniest movies ever made. It was definitely one of those movies where you're recalling a lot of funny parts a day later. This was a tailor - made role for John C. Reilly, who is perfect in and for the part, as is just about everyone in it."
6581,"In the end it's the tenacious performance by the beautiful Jurnee Smollett that holds the emotional premise of the film together. It just happens to be inspirational and uplifting and all that good, boring stuff that cause your eyes to roll when that's how the critics describe it. You may have seen Jurnee Smollett earlier in her career when she was a "" cute kid "" and a promising actress. In addition to being a gorgeous young woman, she's also an accomplished actress, ready for bigger parts in the future. His portrayal of James Farmer, Jr. is outstanding and this role will certainly further his acting career."
6582,"This is Justin Thoreaux's directorial debut and a wonderful one at that. But that makes for some interesting characters. Saw this at the premiere showing at Sundance, where it played well for the crowd and apparently Harvery Weinstein liked it so much he bought it. The Director Justin Theroux was at the showing and answered some questions and he said some interesting things. The main character Henry Roth played by Billy Crudup was an amazing role."
6583,"This is a great movie for all ages. The characters here are well developed and the acting and cinematography is superb. All in all, a most satisfying night out at the movies! There is laughter as well as many touching scenes. On the plus side, the acting is above - par by all the actors (the adult male leads look startlingly like a young Liam Neeson and a Gaelic Antonio Banderas), the location footage is gorgeous, the period "" feels right "", and the title namesake is very well executed and most believable."
6584,"Both Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler are excellent. Oh, and Gerry's singing is amazing too, as are all his witty remarks and comments. * Kudos to Kudrow who is freaking hilarious! ( Synopsis) Holly (Hilary Swank) has been married nine years to a wild Irishman, Gerry Kennedy (Gerard Butler), and her one true love. A man expresses his feelings of his love to his wife, through several shocking surprises after his death."
6587,"It's a good movie to take your kids to, but except for the final battle sequence, D - War is disappointing. It looks kinda like the special effects used on the Power Rangers TV show, to be honest. All of the creatures were well - done, their movements were realistic, and they fit into the other imagery well. The Korean orthodox film - making faction, represented by' Choong Moo Ro' â€“ the Korean version of Hollywood - is the major force of film - making in Korea. The acting of the leads is fine given that the writing is such a dud."
6588,"There are three of four amazing scenes. Stellar film from rising star, Israeli filmmaker Eran Kolirin. In an ocean of predictable movies, "" The Band's Visit "" is an island of bliss. The exchange at the phone and the scenes at the skating rink are precious and very well acted. Kolirin is a writer and director of great economy."
6589,"That being said, it had a few nice action bits and Michael Lillard was very funny (probably on purpose). The opening scenes are amazingly clumsy, they just dump you randomly into the story with no preamble. Of course nothing can be compared to the lord of the rings but this one is just hilarious funny. Uwe Boll does it again, a cast of some of the best actors in one of the worst movies ever made. The whole movie theatre was cracking up because of the unintended funny dialogs in this movie."
6590,"Flawless manages to incorporate wisps' of both these narrative flows, and is better off because of it. All in all a clever, entertaining film, with a good script and very nice central performances, and even a human message. With the able support of Demi Moore, in one of her best performances, and the fine direction of Michael Radford, and a wonderful attention to the little details that make a film so much better, FLAWLESS is very much worth the price of admission. Excellent understated performances from Demi Moore and Michael Caine, especially in the small facial gestures when stressed and so on. "" Flawless "" is a good old - fashioned caper tale done with an abundance of wit, intelligence and style and just enough twists and turns in the plot to keep the audience on its toes throughout."
6592,"The casting is superb and would seem to be a sure recipe for cinematic success--Samuel L. Jackson, Ed Harris, Eve Mendes and Luis Guzman. 35 : 1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5. Especially when Samuel L. Jackson, one of the most distinctive actors ever, is in it. Samuel L. Jackson and Ed Harris did their job very well in the leading roles and Harlin's direction was also good. The actors in the film gives good performances."
6595,"Francis Benhamou and Zoe Lister Jones deliver fine performances as Nasira and Rochel. The gradual and delicate building of the friendship between Rochel and Nasira is beautifully portrayed. One of the major reasons that the Law and Order programs have been continuing successes is the quality of the acting. It really is very funny, witty - and well acted, especially Francis Benhamou as Nasira, who is stunning and positively lights up the screen with her smile. They turn in two flawless performances, and prove themselves to be actresses to watch."
6604,"Young Dawn takes on some new attitudes throughout the film and Weixler attends to her with grace and ease. The beauty of the sweet Jess Weixler is awesome. The lasting impact of such materials however, can be influenced by how well writer - producers have done their homework on matters psychological. Their females have vaginas lined with razor - sharp teeth. Writer - director Mitchell Lichtenstein's concept (a puritanical virgin who grows up next to a nuclear power plant discovers a mean set of incisors below the waist when her sexuality blooms) is intriguing, and some of the film's best moments possess a surreal quality that almost transforms the material into a metaphorical extension of Dawn's (Jess Weixler) awkward adjustment to womanhood."
6602,"Nadine Labaki managed to balance these emotions very successfully throughout the movie. Protective of their privacy, of their feelings, and their sadness. It's all great acting by non-actors, and you wouldn't know it without a press release. ( There is a parallel here with another excellent film making its U. S. appearance, "" The Band's Visit, "" of an Egyptian - Israeli encounter set deliberately outside the political context . ) The storyline is kept simple and clear so even if you don't follow the subtitles, you easily understand the movie."
6603,"The family spent much time moving from place to place, and Strummer spent his childhood in a variety of countries. The film includes live concert footage spanning Strummer's career and tapes of his BBC radio program, all of which provide a fitting soundtrack to his distinctive and storied existence. Yet, in his final years, a much more tranquil and mellow Joe began to emerge, managing to make "" peace "" between the hippies and the punkers by establishing outdoor music fests - affectionately labeled "" Joe's Campfires "" - to help bridge the gap. There are interviews with Joe's squat - mates from the early 70s, Mick Jones and Topper Headon of the Clash, and numerous other people (musicians and other) who either worked with Joe or were influenced by him. In addition to interviews with former lovers and friends of Strummer, the movie provides generous helpings of file footage and home movies, as well as clips from films like "" If"
6608,"As in many of Loach's earlier films, It's a Free World has a strong feeling for those who live on the margins in a society that does not care and, uncharacteristically for Loach, is surprisingly even - handed, showing the viewpoint of both the victim and the victimizer. Though It's a Free World is far less impactful than some of the earlier Loach - Laverty collaborations, it is a strong film that does not pull its punches and did not deserve a one - day U. K. opening and a direct - to - DVD treatment. Lastly the film begins and ends with the dynamic performance of unknown Kierston Wareing. A striking example that it is your coterie that counts, and not your talents and qualities. Wareing is wonderfully cast and she is instantly recognisable to anyone who knows the "" cheeky sexy woman "" who work as reps etc in the "" real world ""."
6616,"That is what covering the ears, head, and hands does; and it was and is standard treatment to continue this for hours and days. The most you'll ever find is a reference to "" enhanced interrogation techniques "" (i. e., torture). While what they have to say is compelling, the absence of any testimony of those who gave them those orders is absent. This film is a worthy attempt to bring what has become a familiar subject throughout the Bush years without necessarily giving the other side an opportunity to state their case. The film is written, directed and narrated by Alex Gibney, son of a high - ranking naval officer who was an interrogator in World War II."
6621,"4 and many b*tch ing and moaning 1 star reviews. In 2008, the re-make, also directed by Haneke, debuts with an all new cast and this time in English. And, indeed, "" Funny Games "" busts through the horror movie conventions with an almost ruthless determination. The performances are overall well - executed, especially by Naomi Watts, an actress who has proved that she will still take risks despite the fact that she has made it both in the art - house scene and in mainstream Hollywood. And if you've ever tried to criticize modern art, or almost any art, you're probably familiar with some brutal rebuttals and denials."
6622,"But ,' The Counterfeiters' is classy stuff. Karl Markovics is the shining light of the cast. The sweet young Russian boy Kolya (Sebastian Urzendowsky) is a purist, living only for his individual style and his love of the classic Russian modernists. There is also a surprising amount of humour; while the bigger picture is indeed bleak, there are moments of comedy, and even if it is laughter in the dark, it is welcome and helps not only to carry the film along but humanise it and its characters. com, the website of Lawrence Malkin, the author of Kreuger's Men, an account of counterfeiting operations during World War II."
6626,"Douglas Silva (Acerola) relies on his intuitive acting and his big, expressive fish face. And trafficker Nefasto suddenly changing sides in the gang war; and Acerola's one - chance - in - a-million spotting trafficker Fiel still alive, and the phony solution linking Acerola's and Laranjinha's fathers in the past, etc. . After the success of "" Citade de Deus "", KÃ¡tia Lund and Fernando Meirelles, (the directors) created a series called "" Cidade dos Homens "" ("" City of God "") based on the same concept taking place in the present which in 2007 was turned into another feature length film with the same title. The best is Darlan Cunha as Laranjinha: no - nonsense, nonplussed, witty and resourceful, his deadpan acting is the essence of the "" carioca cool "". Antonio Pinto's music is beautiful but inexplicably old - fashioned for a movie about teenagers."
6627,"Written and directed by Brett Morgan, the documentary "" Chicago 10 "" blends amazing archival footage with animated re-enactments of the trial â€“ based on actual court transcripts â€“ with A-list actors like Hank Azaria, Nick Nolte, Mark Ruffalo, Roy Scheider and Liev Schreiber providing the voices. There are a few movies, Pink Floyd's extraordinary antiWar film' The Wall' one of them, in which the animation provides graphic imagery to enhance the surreal feeling for the viewer. Brett Morgen revisited the courtroom of the Chicago 7's 1968 trial as truthfully as possible, a lesson every film maker should take. Maybe this film will give Eminem's work a new meaning :) who knows. While the animation is hit - and - miss (and a bit eerie ala "" Heavy Metal "") the archival footage of the real - life instigators / participants is truly remarkable and should be seen by all who wondered what it was to live during a revolution."
6628,"Many interesting arguments, many good points. It is a thought provoking, well executed expose' on the manipulations of the masses by those with wealth and power. A film worth watching over and over again - if you can stomach its dreadful horrors, both in picture and in concept. While this film is aimed to prove everything presented as truth, one should watch this with an open mind. Some critics even seem to derive a weird kind of pleasure from neglecting things and praising their narrow views about the Zeitgeist being overly one sided."
6629,"Astonishing landscapes, amazing filming, music of beauty. The band's connection with their audience is very real and the concerts have a feeling of warmth and intimacy. Sigur Ros choose some remarkable locations in which to play their music. The visuals that director Dean DeBlois has added to enhance the music are magical. Heima also presents the viewer with an all - encompassing look at the beauty of Iceland as a segment of a much larger picture, Earth."
6632,"It is a real story about real people coming across real problems. That is a warning to the adults: beware and make best to predict. Camera work always showed perfect angles, so people could easily follow the story. But all the new actors, that were working on this project, played really good, without hyping their performance, what usually happens for new actors. Ilmar Raag has done a great job by showing what is going on in schools nowadays."
6636,"Some of the friendships he makes are truly touching and in a way, the best part of the film. Director Patricia Riggen's UNDER THE SAME MOON is a brave film that proudly puts a face to an issue that has polarized America. In that thought, both the title and the dualistic tone are set for a surprisingly poignant piece about the borders that keep both countries and people apart. Eugenio Derbez in particular, does an amazing job as the hardened sidekick who discovers his heart might still be open to caring. They don't dwell on that, but there must have been a good reason since she loves the kid and vice-versa."
6812,"It's a little bit of Shrek the Grinch. Shrek the Third was mildly amusing, while this is side - splittingly funny. This little 22 minute marvel accomplishes what Shrek the Third could not: it is consistently funny and works well on its own. Dreamworks had this little gem up it's sleeve. that may seem way to dramatic but if Shrek the Halls can pull it of then maybe there is hope for the ones yet to come."
6642,"What makes Ã€ L'IntÃ©rieur so effective by comparison is that the violence piles up and leads to a climactic finale. There are parts of this film where she TRULY kicks a lot of ass. One important thing about this film is that is very good at maintaining tension and suspense, something that very few gory movies do. She's fantastic in 37 Â° 2 le matin, and her menacing performance is easily the best thing about this film. Worth watching twice for catching these pearls."
6648,"And the rest of the cast is terrific as well, including Hiam Abbass, Haaz Sleiman and Danai Jekesai Gurira. Haaz Sleiman, who plays Tarek, is (damn foxy) full of life as Tarek. This is a lovely, gentle and touching film that works on many levels. Haaz Sleiman and Danai Gurira are terrifically winning as Tarek and Zainab, and they make their bonding with Walter more than credible. It operates at many levels at once, presenting a comedy, drama, social statement and lesson, magnificently intertwined."
6654,"Very idiosyncratic, quirky and confident in what it does, with many laugh - out - loud moments. There are several' laugh - out - loud' moments, from the opening titles, to the touching climax, and at many points in between, in a well written, perfectly paced film. It's worth seeing this film just for their performances. Complementing these two are several conflicted characters whose eccentricities easily rival their own. Paralleling the overactive imaginations of youth, the fantastical characters and events are both the highlight of the film and it's only downside."
6655,"Stoners will certainly find something to enjoy here. There's only about 3/4 tests. Morgan Spurlock was a very healthy person, so eating McDonald's nonstop would have drastic affects. This is pretty much proof that someone in the crew has to be sober for a movie to be good. Just to make sure that everything was as scientifically pure as could be expected in such a dubious experiment, Benson goes clean and sober for a month."
6668,"Steve Talley (Dwight Stifler), in particular, has a great energy and screen presence. Some great characters, fun filled pranks and well put together teen action in this spin off of the Amercan Pie franchise. This is the honest truth, "" Beta House "" makes the first few "" American Pie "" movies look like "" The Little Mermaid "". Beta House shows more nudity then The Naked Mile, which is surprising considering the previous installments title. Star Wars became a massive success that stunned audiences with it's ahead of its time special effects."
6662,"It makes for some beautiful moments. Its visuals (such as set design, camera angles and cinematography) are very pleasing, accentuated by its seemingly unrelated parallel narratives and absurdist premise. Putting the great, great Samantha Morton together with Herzog, Richard Strange, Leos Carax (Pola X), Anita Pallenberg, Diego Luna, and James Fox - matches any casting coup by John Waters. The impersonators stay in character 24 hrs a day. Mister Lonely is deeply original, strange and yet accessible."
6666,"It leaves the viewer with continuous emotions towards the Likens girls, especially Sylvia. But something about it is compelling, like craning your neck to see what horrors can be spotted at the scene of a car crash. She exposes raw and powerful talent in this film, almost like she is actually going through the same agony and despair as Sylvia Likens really did, she is painfully convincing and yet again, she fails to disappoint. Here Page plays Likens as a sensitive, kind and considerate sixteen year old and when the world comes crashing down upon her, the suffering she endures is heartbreaking and convincingly rendered by Page. Also, a vital example of just what sort of person Gertrude is would be to let the viewers know that, while the children slept on dirty, urine soaked mattresses (and there were not enough of these for all of the occupants in the home) Gertrude had a complete bedroom set in her room."
6672,"And that's just one of many truly lovely moments. This film is truly enjoyable in all aspects. This one is currently making the festival rounds, and last night played at Los Angeles' Outfest, to an enthusiastic crowd. From writer / director Jonah Markowitz down to even the smallest details, this one's a winner. While there are some scenes that scream "" low budget, "" the end product as a whole was very rewarding."
6673,"This energetic bunch of septua -, octo - & nona - genarians dive into rock, punk, disco and more, and you'll be surprised what a goldmine they find. You will absolutely love Fred Knittle's rendition of Coldplay's "" Fix You . "" These moments also bring some of the most powerful songs including a stirring rendition of Coldplay's "" Fix You "" by returning ex-member Fred Knittle with his Johnny Cash - like baritone. Stephen Walker has captured the essence of the group, under the intelligent direction of Bob Cilman. The group sings rock standards and stuff that is pretty recent."
6678,"The cast is excellent and weird while the story - lines are randomly weaved together gems of the absurd and quirky. So, it was very entertaining, it includes very good jokes, deep emotions, it shows relationships between each other and their attitude to game. You will spot a friend or yourself in one or more of the players, and the cameos are fun, including Phil "" the hillside strangler "" Laak as he was introduced. This is one of those occasions and it deserves bountiful praise for both bravery and laughs. Zak Penn has done an exceptional job at taking talented actors, great characters and made a film that doesn't go where you expect it to."
6706,"The water level was much lower at that time, so the cliff faces were higher and more impressive. The movie's account of the massive three - gorges project is quite detailed. This is just one example of how some fine - tuning and refinements could have brought this film one step closer to being a masterpiece. ' Up the Yangtze' is skillfully edited by Hannele Halm to underline social contrasts. There are some nice panoramic shots, and interlaced among the genuinely touching moments was a wry humour."
6685,"Everything production wise, it does with really any faults. This is Belgina cinema on his best. The brilliant thing about the movie is that it is a one on one translation of the writer Herman Brusselmans. "" Ex Drummer "" by Koen Mortier could be described as a major update of the tradition started by Benoit Poelvoorde's masterpiece "" C'est arrivÃ© pres de chez vous "". There are some great scenes of punk bands playing punk music."
6692,"Paddy Cunneen's score makes it clear that this is, at its heart, a tale of intrigue. This film does what all great films do, it educates and opens your eyes and mind to new on suggestions, in a sense it widens your experiences. His subtle and moving role as the child murderer released after a youth spent in institutions, captures both the wide - eyed innocence and the dark and guilty conscience that Jack carries with him. "" Boy A "" explores an obscure case in America, but apparently a very famous one in England, telling the story of a released convict who might have more than a few problems adapting back to society. This movie hearkens back to the great working class British film dramas of the 1960s."
6700,"They all work well off their partner (as none of the groups interact with any of the others), and you can see the honest and sincere emotions in their facial and body expressions (since there are many moments where dialogue is not expressed as much as facial emotion). In the end, the stories are full of both beginnings and endings for all of the characters. Also Carly Pope, Diora Baird and Kristin Booth look delicious. "" Young People F-cking "" is honest, real, unpretentious, sad, and funny all at the same time. These are characters that have had their emotions stomped on, who have genuinely real problems that just about anyone in the audience can relate to."
6701,"Definitely Surfwise compellingly did all of the above. gives up his possessions, and moves to Isreal to live off the land. As was the case with "" Doc, "" the kids became champion surfers and the family was profiled numerous times in magazine articles and television segments. It chronicles the amazing journey of "" Doc "" Paskowitz, his nine kids and his beautiful and understanding wife Juliette. Keeping group of siblings on good terms is a challenge for any family."
6707,"In both cases, Herzog features striking footage and amusing interviews and narration. ' Encounters at the End of the World' is an engrossing, fascinating exploration of what it takes to exist in one of the world's most unforgiving landscapes. Do your brain a favor and lose yourself in' Encounters at the End of The World'. There are so many breathtaking moments of sheer rugged beauty that it will bring tears to your eyes. If you are looking for answers as to why a red worm lives in the anus of static sea life or the consistency of the milk of a baby seal, you have come to the right place."
6712,"The pacing is fantastic and all the characters are likable. Another thing that really proved affective was the films realism, the crock looked very real, was of plausible size, but most definitely wasn't small. A total bonus was the awesome special effects. The characters all portray strong performances, especially when the pressure sets in and they begin to crack. Effects aren't usually that good in Australian movies, but the effects in this one are brilliant!"
6724,"well because it is chocked full of humans and human interactions. People exchanging hardships and moments of simple pleasure. This can be exhausting at times, but it can also be very exciting. So, give it a chance even if you're a bit amazed by all the flashing frames. At every moment of the movie, the picture is split up into lots of little pictures, often showing the same scene from different camera angles."
6733,"No wonder Disney gonna's make a fortune. The one good thing of this movie was Ashley Tisdale's performance; she got the character of Sharpay spot - on. P. S. check out Chads t - shirts - they are hilarious. The movie is longer, most of the scenes are more realistic, the directing and the acting seem to have vastly improved, and most importantly of all, the songs and the music are just AMAZING. The lyrics are beautiful, and nearly all of the songs are spectacular."
6742,"There are some lovely little references only noticeable to the more vigorous Django fans, and a truly awesome ending. In a time when ridiculously unoriginal films are hailed by critics and average viewers alike, it's great to see something truly different come to the screen. Japanese themes and references are inherent because the director is well. The good in Sukiyaki come in the form of a commendable visual attention to detail and beautiful lighting, the blistering action and the comic book vibe he goes for that recalls the days of FUDOH and DEAD OR ALIVE. That's to say the dialogue itself is a pastiche of noticeable one - liner clichÃ©s, over the top silly yet listening to entire dialogues stitched together from over used lines has a remarkably refreshing effect on those lines."
6766,"The script is amusing, in places. You won't laugh every seconds, but the over whole of the movie is funny. It features brilliant performances and will hopefully propel Mitchell and Webb's career to greater heights. Next came The Illusionist, an inferior movie to The Prestige, but a movie once again extremely good. The comedy never reaches great heights, its a movie full of small laughs and the occasional bigger laugh."
6789,"And Genji's main goal is to best his own father who is a boss in the yakuza and to do that he must become the top fighter in Suzuran High. Genji (Oguri Shun), a son of yakuza boss must achieve an unprecedented unification of notorious Suzuran High School (AKA: Crow's High School) in order to take over his father's position. Oguri Shun's character developed very well, from a clueless kid to a leader backed by many trustworthy friends. If you assemble a staff like Takashi Miike, Shun Oguri, and Meisa Kuroki, you can expect a better than average high school drama. Known for movies like Audition and Big Bang Love, Juvenile A, both which were released here, this is probably one of his more accessible films to date, even though it treads on familiar territory with elements of the yakuza."
6809,"The cinematography in this film is interesting and the sound effects give the movie a lot more edge considering the gore is minimal aside from the liberal use of blood. The main demon of flies which smells blood looks impressive and very Lovecraftian. The gorgeous Elize du Toit is also excellent in the role of a student that intends to help Nick and finds the truth of the devil's chair. But as the couple begin to go at it, their pleasurable experience turns into a nightmare: the chair â€” actually a portal to a hellish realm inhabited by a rapacious tentacled demon â€” traps Sammy, impales her with metal spikes and tendrils, and then whisks her body away. Dr. Willard, his assistant Melissa (Louise Griffiths) and the students Rachel Fowles (Elize du Toit) and Brett Wilson (Matt Berry) head with Nick to the Blackwater Asylum finding the dreadful truth about the devil's chair."
6833,"As another one of his songs goes, "" To everything turn, turn, turn "". This is a film that is well worth seeking out by fans of old school folk music, political activists & environmentalists. In addition to priceless archival footage of Seeger performing at various stages in his career, director Jim Brown provides a generous helping of interviews to help round out Seeger's story. And rather than being annoying, the gentle harmonies will embrace you like your favorite warm jammies on a cold winter night. The film includes some very moving concert footage in both large and small venues as well as interviews with such folk music legends as Arlo Guthrie, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Paxton, Joan Baez, Bonnie Raitt, Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks, Mary Travers and Bob Dylan."
6834,"If you are a romantic one, and open to art movies, this will become a piece of your soul. The emotions are very powerful and you just cannot help but love the characters. "" 5 Centimeters Per Second "" can be classified as a love - drama film as it contains plenty of both. He still care about Akari even after having worked for a few years, or even in relationship with his girlfriend. Later he entered a Univ in Tokyo, and in his campus life he also had some beautiful affections with his workmate in some social work."
6835,"May you see wide spread distribution and happy lives. And finally, the movie became very famous when winning at the World Filmfestival in Montreal. There's also a lot of nice extra's on the DVD including the game Archlord itself, overall a well thought out, complete film package! This is Greg Timmermans first film and he preformed beyond beautifully, bring subtlety to his role rarely seen by seasoned actors let alone a brand new face. In Belgian director Nic Balthazar's Ben X, Ben (Greg Timmermans) is not only highly intelligent but is different - very different."
6855,""" Timecrimes "" was an engaging movie that is easy to follow, despite it's complex plot. A great movie (like this one) does not need: famous name actors, good - looking / sexy protagonists, stupendous sets, expensive special effects, gratuitous violence, & violent shocks to be a successful, entertaining, and provocative movie, which this is in every respect. The feature length debut of Nacho Vigalondo is a pretty good science - fiction thriller with a sprinkle of horror thrown in. A little bit of nudity provided by beautiful Barbara Goenaga certainly helps! What makes the film so spectacular is that everything is the movie is not the result of high tech, computer generated imagery, or dazzling special effects, or an overblown budget."
6872,"It's, by far, one of the most thrilling experiences in the land of gore movies for about the last 10 years. Some will be better than others regarding similar subjects. These recent events give Frontier (s) a healthy dose of sub-text as well as a realistic backdrop for its extreme violence. Frontier (s) is a fast - paced, very violent thrill - ride from Xavier Gens. The action scenes with the guns were very cool and probably the most memorable parts of the movie."
6874,"There were so many cheers and constant laughter throughout the film. Put them all together, mix in some campy humour & you have yourself a fun time at the movies. Bruce appeared there in person and he was as charming, funny and charismatic as his alter egos on screen. However, the movie's slant toward the realm of the B - movie makes these quirks seem perfectly in place. It contains references to almost every movie he has done in his 26 year career, and every fan should pick up on all the references within this film."
6932,"Having written, directed, and acted in this film, this says much about Mouret's talent. Shown as part of the Rendez - Vous with French Cinema at Lincoln Center, February 29 - March 9 , 2008; this opened in France December 12 , 2007, receiving high marks from the critics (AlloCinÃ© press rating 3. The ending is ingenious, but the fun is getting there, and the way Mouret's straightforward direction, simple camera - work, and above all his witty, well - paced dialogue keep the audience consistently engaged and delighted. The way these two relationships unfold is enough to keep the viewer's attention. Loved the use of color to highlight moods an emotions, with the clothes of the actors and the background of the sets complementing each other wonderfully."
6933,"Polanco's riveting performance is what gives legitimacy to Chop Shop's realism. But the life scenes were attractive, it's like observing than watching. Chop Shop is a hidden treasure out in theaters! Bahrani tells the story of Alejandro (Alejandro Polanco), better known as Ale. Polanco is outstanding in the lead role, and Gonzalez gives solid support as the older sister."
6955,"Tom Cavanaugh's performance was spot on. Tom Cavanaugh does a nice job. The writing was first - rate and hilarious, and the performances were uniformly brilliant. Laurie Lynd's direction of Tom Cavanaugh, Ben Shenkman and, of course, show - stealer - Noah Bernett, is nothing less than magical. As it is, he is sort of a child genius of fun fashion and cosmetics."
6993,"The best thing about this movie, actually, what makes this movie really really good is the climax (operation yashima). But that's exactly what makes Evangelion a joy to watch. One of the most remarkable things about this movie is how easily the episodes translate into the arch of a feature length film. Gainax has refreshed a timeless classic without taking the magic away from the original series. The classic epic story is retold with amazing new animation, new sound effects, new music and new scenes."
7015,Where he has much more success is with the children because they are quite normal people despite these views. He is able to put a human side on the group and extensively interviews Phelps family members. Documentarian Louis Theroux does a remarkable job staying semi-objective while still trying to open some of the groups eyes a little. They are known to protest with picket signs that are very bold and utterly deplorable. Would love to see and hear his thoughts and reactions at the end of each day of filming.
7027,"In terms of SF, it's a mixed bag of genuinely inspired ideas in the form of a completely original alien world, and some familiar ideas from the humans. Another highlight of the movie was that the aliens were, you know, just alien. The film was incredible - the world Tsirbas created is gorgeous and totally unique. From the very first moments when you're introduced to the lush alien world, you know that this film will be a visual treat, and it delivers right through to the end. There are more than a few scenes that are emotionally engaging."
7028,"Fortunately, during the important (scary) scenes, the acting is spot - on, and very convincing. That night, the plan succeeds; they awaken to the sound of footsteps and find three - toed tracks. Paranormal CRAPTivity is a great idea. The' supernatural' scenes are very convincing considering the subject matter, whether scripted or improvised. It was made a couple of years ago and yet it only became popular now because of all the hype."
7117,"IF YOU HAVEN'T seen MR. WARMTH, whether or not you are a fan, see it. While the film does have a very small amount of missteps editing and a few instances where it veers off - topic to ill effect, for the most part it's quite highly enjoyable and hilarious to boot. He also has been married for thirty years, has two sons, and is loved. But it remains pleasant to watch, with brief bits about popular Rickles roles (like the voice of Mr. Potato Head in the "" Toy Story "" franchise), and a generous dose of laughs. THE ACT THAT has been so successful for "" Mr. Warmth "" consists of his being rude, obnoxious and insulting to his fans."
7146,"The staging is accurate and the costumes lovely. Alice Krige was great as Lady Russell, and Anthony Head as Sir Walter Elliot. This lovely production has a brooding quality that mirrors the circumstances of the author. She played Anne's emotions very well. Creative film making ideas give the production a fresh face and make for memorable, visually gorgeous film moments."
7235,"Gervais's gags are more than adequate in that they service a chuckle, however stand up is more than gags, the greats are more then simply joke machines, they are jesters, actors and stylists. Gervais started his career playing versions of himself and characters that are perceived as annoying bastards, he does continue this persona on stage, and it works fantastically well, this is a reasonably funny show. The writer and star of The Office has really made a name for himself since, winning BAFTAs, a British Comedy Award, Emmys and a Golden Globe, and he has done well with stand - up comedy as well, Animals is very good, Politics is alright, and this was his third show. Ricky Gervais was number 49 on The Comedians' Comedian, he was number 18 on Britain's Favourite Comedian, and he was number 11 on 100 Greatest Stand - Ups. The material covers AIDS, charity work, fame, unworthy diseases and other stuff that allows him to be irritated and mostly it is pretty funny and creatively done."
7305,"As strange as The Poughkeepsie Tapes is it is a gem. A real breath of fresh air in a genre that seems to be nothing more than retreads of the same garbage. Very few bring such motivation, confidence, and shining capabilities to screen, but The Poughkeepsie Tapes pleasingly differentiates itself from just another fake piece of work in the sea. The Poughkeepsie Tapes occupies more than just mindless snuff, but depth, efficient backstory, and impeccable detail in its photography, execution, and realism. the characters (some of them) are so vulnerable and authentic and even kind of lovable that the scares have a lot more impact."
7455,"' Shameless' is a must - see for anyone with an interest in comedy. C. K.'s standup special Chewed Up is one of the funniest stand up specials of recent years, and his followup specials have consistently performed above average in quality. However, Louis C. K.: Shameless may be his weakest installment, although still able to provide capable entertainment for fifty - five minutes. And that's what makes Louis' jokes funny. Like George Carlin, Louis CK has the ability to show that anything, no matter how mean - spirited or dark, has the capacity to be funny, if not hilarious."
7543,"but this current one will be much more enjoyed by the purists. The actor playing Henry Tilney was charming (maybe more than the book Henry Tilney in fact) and all the others seemed to fit their roles. It's fitting that a cheeky, confident and funny writer (Andrew Davies) gets to have a bit of fun with this one some 200 years later. Carey Mulligen (Bleak House, The Amazing Mrs. Prichard) is a young actress who really understands period drama, and can bring her full self to it without seeming modern. The second half of the movie is filled by actions more moving, obviously very well known due to its literal master."
7553,"Their scenes together are quite moving. Those scenes are well worth the price of admission. As others have commented, the scene where the 14 year old boy and the loner encounter at home is dramatic, tense and well acted. Moments of brilliance then, from all involved, but in the end Clapham Junction is deeply flawed and devoid of any shred of hope. Shergold and Elyot are well served by their actors, with Treadaway and Mawle in particular offering spectacularly honest, real and brave performances â€“ their plot - strand is perhaps the most challenging, the most unsettling but ultimately the most truthful story, and this time the concluding lack of hope is in proportion and understandable."
7628,"That's another beauty of the thing, Fado and Portuguese: both are able to integrate different peoples, and different cultures, all unique, and all the same! One of the film's greatest services is to show, via the excellent subtitles, the sublime folk poetry that makes up much of the lyrics of Fado. Then comes his latest film "" Fados, "" a heady mix of dance and melancholic Portuguese folk song rendered by mesmerizing singers such as Mariza and Carlos do Carmos Even the dancing scenes are great, though the dance is not belonging to fado. The appearance of Mariza, Camane and Carlos do Carmo are magnificent."
7645,"But the characters are vivid and interesting. Ephram, a man of strikingly good looks, offers Trevor warmth. There are several quite well - written, well - observed scenes; director Rosser Goodman delivers a polished product with solid tech values. Brent Gorski, the writer and star, is really a wonderfully talented filmmaker. Ephram, filled with ambition, gives Trevor hope."
7982,"It's amazing that this piece of work was realized in only 4 years. This man, ney, hyphenate, who not only had the vision but the talent todeliver this level of quality is homage to the fact that anyone with enough desire and strong enough dream can make it all happen. When people find a true connection, even in one day, they give each other gifts and profess their love for each other. "" An Angel Named Billy "" misses on almost all these counts. But most intriguing was having the honor of peaking under the curtain to see / hear / feel and be touched by the Wizard himself: director / producer / executive producer / writer / original concept / additional script changes / distributor / location and production car provider, Greg Osborne."
8103,"It does have its moments and it successfully stands alone. Jason Schwartzman and Natalie Portman deliver a fine performance. Jason Schwartzman is great, perhaps the stronger of the two performances, although Natalie Portman is not to be dismissed here. This was a beautiful little film that that plays out like one Truffaut's Antoine Donielle films. The short has a great air to it and all the style and tone that exist within his films."
8291,"After Ultimate Avengers, Ultimate Avengers 2: Rise of the Panther and Iron Man this is one great addition. Dr. Strange is a likable character from bad to good you know he's special. the action scenes are very well done. PS: If you're looking for a more fluidly animated comic, have a look at "" Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1 "" it is much darker in tone than the previous animated marvel films, but that is definitely appropriate for the subject matter."
8391,"The production values weren't bad. But the sum of this movie is definitely better than a few of its parts. The two main actors are pretty good. It was shown at ImageOut, the Rochester Lesbian and Gay Film and Video Festival. A livelier or more varied approach by the director and / or actors would have helped."
8515,"And It's awesome in all aspects of the word. Samuel L. Jackson lends his talents in the voice department, and is also credited as one of the shows producers. The Anime animation is slick and cool and moves with all the conventions you will be used to from the genre. The highly stylized art works well for such a show, containing an exceptionally high level of detail more common in feature film animation than in a direct - to - DVD miniseries. If you are into arse kicking samurai's and Samuel L. Jackson."
8545,"He's cute, sweet and charming, and he comes light years closer than anybody else to acting something like a real human being. This was the fourth project written and directed by Rasper, and it won several awards at European film festivals. It's one of "" those "" scenes viewers find themselves almost physically holding their breath in anticipation (and Steven really, really does outdo himself here). When the film's long - a-coming "" showdown "" finally does arrive, it's a doozie. Speaking of "" war, "" perhaps this is the best point to mention that "" Fashion Wars "" might have been a far better film title, inasmuch as it certainly does have its share of skirmishes (well, admittedly, its share of "" victims, "" too)."
8107,"The first few seasons are, for the most part, extremely fantastic, focused, funny, fresh, intelligent and even at times, brilliant. In fact, this show ratings and success is based upon these three seasons. First three or four seasons: Solid gold; funny, good plot lines. The first three seasons of this show are the worth to watch. You'll find romance, love and emotions with some dose of comedy after that."
6649,"Surprisingly, though, that scene, amongst others, is actually pretty well done. , a lot more swearing, and just plain old vulgarities every single second. Vanessa is well played by the attractive Danneel Harris in a role that doesn't get much screen time. The expression Kal Penn brings about for different situations are perfect and fits the scenes very well. To point out, as pretty clear from the uncensored trailers, it was awesome to see NPH and G "" Dubya "" Bush."
7002,"It is not his style and it doesn't make you forget the failings in substance, but it is engaging as pure style. Hardy is a fine actor (or this would be a 1 star review), but the tone is all wrong and far too many scenes were uncomfortably hard to watch. The attempts to elicit humor were cringe - worthy. For the most part however, Tom Hardy's gritty and aggressive performance will go down as one of the best kept secrets of 2009. It will be hard to knock out Hardy as a surefire grand actor for years to come."
6635,The messages in this were pretty good. Drillbit Taylor was such an awesome movie. The acting in this was pretty good especially out of the kids. Take one part Owen Wilson and three parts high school freshman and you have a clever comedy. It's front - loaded--meaning the first half has so many laughs you can't hear all the lines for the laughter.
7005,"Arta Dobroshi is literally on screen for every single scene, and for all but a few seconds of the film: an amazing performance. Dobroshi delivers an outstanding performance, as does Renier who has become one of the Dardennes' most confident regulars. Arta Dobroshi had a "" make or break "" role here, and she delivered a thrilling performance. Their films are filled with body language, gestures and close camera - work. Instead, each shot here is much more staged and deliberate, focused on Lorna (Arta Dobroshi) and making sure the audience is able to appreciate all of her surroundings in each moment."
7006,"The opening credits are pretty cool. "" There are a lot of quiet but magic moments like that in this documentary, that make it so captivating. One of the most memorable scenes is just Page in his home library full of vinyl, wall to wall. Sure, the moments of jamming are wonderful, but the conversations are always cut short. There are lots of great moments to behold in this film, even if it does feel ready to finish about 20 minutes before it actually does."
6820,"The first was great, action - packed and an entertaining movie on all levels. For a movie that promised absolutely nothing, it delivered everything. It could have been a lot worse, and the bugs looked realistic enough. The "" bugs "" are more detailed and everyone has been upgraded - the bugs have XXL - scorpions and humans have, well, shovels. But overall Starship Troopers 3 is a worthy watch and a decent followup to the other films."
6847,"All of these aspects together create a sense of intimacy with Wendy. But too has this vibrant and adept filmmaker paid great notice to the neo-realists of yesteryear, particularly De Sica (the entire film can almost be seen as a contemporized Umberto D.). Fortunately for those who had difficulty sitting still through a quiet, unassuming film such as Wendy and Lucy, there is more than enough television on the airwaves these days to satisfy. Most actresses her age with her resume would scoff at the idea of playing such a simple and expressionless character who hasn't showered for days and wears cut off brown pants and an unflattering blue sweatshirt but she breathes life into Wendy and adds an extra dimension to her. Michelle Williams and Lucy the Dog star as Wendy and Lucy, respectively, in this remarkably affecting drama about a poor, independent woman escaping from her undisclosed troubles and making her way to Alaska with her dog."
8600,"Say, stay home tonight, clip your nails. Not better than G. O. R. A. but it is still very good. A and A. R. O. G, not same success in special effects but seems satisfying and good enough. A. R. O. G. is an successful example of modern Turkish comedy. Like Stephen Chow made for Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Street, Cem Yilmaz made the same affect in Turkish cinema in G. O. R."
6805,"The only good thing about it is the charisma of the leads, and a funny appearance by Jon Favreau. But still while this movie doesn't really stand out and it is incredibly predictable, there are some really fun moments. As with all comedies chemistry is important but so is the comedy. This rudely rambunctious, intermittently funny 2008 holiday comedy is a supreme case of Hollywood overkill along the lines of Jay Roach's "" Meet the Fockers "". Another potentially funny Hollywood comedy hits the skids when it encounters a message."
6802,"The crowd scenes are remarkable, and all of the location shooting miraculously right. All around this structure, the direction skilfully grows - up the flesh of the human content, social layers and ethical matters. ; James Franco heartbreaking; Diego Luna, devastating; Josh Brolin, flawless. The film is constructed brilliantly in a series of vignettes that builds up into a whole fluid narrative. Penn's performance is one of the most vibrant, fascinating, brilliant performances in years, and one of the most convincing and human."
6634,"People have commented that the fight scenes were pretty good. The best thing about these scenes is that they're authentic: what the actors are doing is so "" real "" you "" believe "" it. It's definitely worth the price of a rental, and worth the $10 to see it in theaters, if you've got no other plans. Good things about it: fantastic soundtrack, good acting, great locations, professional fighting and pretty good story, albeit being a bit simple and predictable. If you weren't old enough to see movies and understand them back in 1984, this may seem like a pretty good movie."
6646,"As is typical of such parodies, the movie's approach is as subtle as a spitball gun. It's a fun movie if you're into the genre but overall falls far too short of being as good as the classics. It's also able to fulfill the expectations of the average moviegoer while giving some clever surprises to those who don't see them coming. Even when there is simple dialog in the foreground, there may well be funny things happening behind the cast. This is way better than most films that spoof other films."
6848,"The setting of London is glorious and the moments of humor in this drama are well placed. LAST CHANCE HARVEY is a breath of fresh air amongst a sea of dark dramas up for kudos. The joy isn't discovery of the predictable plot developments, but of two pros filling the screen with their brand of humanity. Beyond that, Hoffman has moments of stillness more beautiful than any actor's fussy line readings. Kathy Baker plays Jean, Harvey's ex-wife, with poise and elegance."
6703,"In terms of plot the demands of a ninety minute episode are far greater, and the transition itself hasn't been entirely smooth. They go absolutely wild, bouncing around the feature, indulging and expanding in some of their most twisted desires. A rift between two alternate universes appears above Earth, and immediately people assume the worst. All in all, it will be hard for the third installment to make' The Beast with a Billion Backs' look good. Like an average episode of Fox's red - headed stepchild of a masterpiece, "" The Beast With A Billion Backs "" starts out as one thing and goes some pretty outlandish and unpredictable places."
6849,"At 44 years of age, he looks so energetic, confident and charismatic. The cinematography, soundtrack, costumes and art direction are all well done. The film moves forward at a brisk pace and contains a surprisingly large amount of fight scenes. The fighting is very well choreographed, and the stunts are really amazing. See this film in theaters or on DVD as soon as you can, you will not be disappointed."
6647,"The verbal exchanges between characters are also exceptionally written, heated and intense with a good ear for dialogue. It's a well crafted film, with very good gun fighting scenes that tends to become a bit overboard, but still realistic enough. It's filled with riveting gun - battles and fights and it's a movie not afraid to show some real brutal violence and blood. There are even a few genuine laughs to go with all of of the action and it is great to see Jay Mohr doing something other than "" The Ghost Whisperer! "" Chris Evans does a decent job, Cedric The Entertainer and Jay Mohr are nice additions who add some comedy, and it's a small role but Naomie Harris deserves a shout - out for playing the down - to - earth voice of reason character."
6801,"Great plot, great animation and the 3D was amazing. It's amazing the amount of detail the animators put in. Actually, most of them are great animations. Everything in the movie looks so realistic and yet doesn't contradict with the animated cartoon - esquire characters. Congrats to the entire Disney Animation studio, well done."
6851,"It was a good tale which taught good principles. -- who bring an amazing richness and authenticity to the characterizations. The notion that one's actions and attitude can greatly affect those around you, in unexpected ways with surprising consequences, was a lovely lesson to learn, rather than the rote "" value of friendship "" moral. The first and most apparent would be the Kingdom of Dor, suffering from an incompetent ruler who puts his emotions first, while the interests of the kingdom are second. The film can be divided into three parts: happy beginning, dismal middle, and of course, the happy ending."
6821,"Needless to say, the outstanding performances are just the necessary requirements that Shanley has successfully met. Great performances, wonderful writing and tough themes. Streep has been on top for some time now and Hoffman has an unmatched resume of fine performances over the past five years. The scenes between Streep and Hoffman are riveting from start to finish. The scenes between Streep and Hoffman crackle with intelligence and frightening intensity."
6651,"The action scenes were really good, superb even. In doing so, this adventure tale is compelling from the very beginning with a quick, fast martial art scene followed by some amazing opening credits. That is true, but Angarano plays the role well and the character adds substance to the story. The cinematography is wonderful, with stunning views, excellent use of CGI without overdoing it, and decent acting. The martial art fights are prolonged and exciting and the storyline is although predictable, entertaining and worthy of an evening storytale."
6715,"It rocks, from the first minute to the last. o_O Eddie Murphy is awesome as both Dave (the ship) and its captain, and the supporting cast is brilliant. Humor, warmth, a friendship / self - confidence message, faith in the good in humans, it's all there and wonderfully done. His physical comedy and facial expressions are comic genius, and there are plenty of laugh out loud moments. If you fancy 90 minutes of fun and pure laughter then this is the film for you."
6822,"It is a monumental face now, so puckered and pleated that it no longer looks merely weathered, as it has for decades, but seems closer to petrified wood. He hovers in the film, in its themes and high - caliber imagery, and of course most obviously in Mr. Eastwood's face. In viewing all of these films, there are performances that are not only superb, but they evoke every one of the emotions and carry the intellect and intelligence of human cognitions to the highest pinnacle of excellence. Eastwood's acting is top notch again, although the years have not been very kind to his voice. Whether or not "" Gran Torino "" will hold up as one of Eastwood's great films remains to be seen, and the film feels like it would be good for multiple viewings."
7025,"Kenner offers lots of practical information and appeals to everyday people. Also important is Barbara Kowalcyk, who works in Washington with her mother as an advocate for stricter laws. Informed by the voices and outlook of bestseller authors Eric Schlosser (' Fast Food Nation') and Michael Pollen (' The Omnivore's Dilemma'), this new film is an exposÃ© that offers some hope that things can be made better through grassroots efforts. The fact that the vast Walmart is switching to organic foods because customers want them shows people vote effectively with their pocketbooks every time they buy a meal. This documentary does a good job educating the consumers on how food is produced, packed and marketed in U. S nowadays."
6858,"Colourfully shot, with good set pieces. Actually, everything really does end up being pretty well done across the board. As appears the heroes of tales as Â¨ 1. Riveting set pieces illuminate the full - blown adventures blending witchcraft, fairies, necromancy and turns out to be extremely amusing. Paul Bettany is a beautifully tragic Dustfinger."
6661,"Often cute, quite engaging, the characters are likable, the story well - paced. A very safe romantic comedy that plays exactly by the rules and wins the general audience over because it manages to have the key ingredient that makes this genre work: chemistry between likable leads. Okay, after 10 minutes of "" Made of Honor "" it is crystal clear that best friends Tom (Patrick Dempsey) and Hannah (Michelle Monaghan) are madly in love with each other, and should be together. In fact the film is the perfect movie to spend a Sunday at home with a popcorn's bag and let the brain rest from the pressures of the week. Maybe such "" wedding "" movies and romantic "" shaggy dog "" stories can never be better than this."
6699,"Steve Carell is at his best. Carell and Hathaway are perfectly matched. That is a good example of the typical circumstances in the scenes that made up this movie. The cast is absolutely stacked, Alan Arkin, the Rock, Dave Koechner all kick ass and help make' Get Smart' an instant classic. The new "" Get Smart "" does a masterful job of capturing the style, tone and humor of the '60s series, while transporting it into a modern sensibility."
7029,"They're presented in three section--the sex movies, the horror movies and the action movies. Like any good documentary, it's a real eye opening experience to get an insight into the lost world of blood, bikers and boobs. This extremely entertaining and informative low - budget documentary traces the revival of the Australian film industry, which all but died at the mid-30's Pacific onset of WWII, from its fledgling late 60's re-birth, through its multi-faceted heyday in the 70's and early 80's. The films celebrated here were made in the 70s and 80s and are an Australian equivalent of what would usually be called drive in or exploitation movies. Moreover though, there are A LOT of clips from these films, and they serve to make this documentary more fast - moving and entertaining than most of the movies it covers."
6610,"The cast is a solid mix of familiar and old faces. The premise of this film makes a refreshing change from the ordinary style of mainstream movies. But just moments earlier taking out a score of Secret Service agents was a walk in the park! This plot has twists and turns and is completely logical. Dennis Quaid, Forest Whitaker, William Hurt, Matthew Fox (of LOST fame) and even Sigorney Weaver give this film the star power it requires."
7033,"The joy is in the details of Koreeda's observations, and the forceful animation of them by the cast. This film by writer / director Koreeda is a triumph of simplicity. Stepping into Ozu's shoes is the acclaimed director Koreeda Hirokazu, whose films "" Nobody Knows "" and "" After Life "" has already garnered universal praises. The comparisons that have been made between the great Japanese director and Koreeda are fully deserved. This is a film both comforting and challenging, that may just turn out to be Koreeda's masterpiece."
6609,"Watch this one on a second or third date OR watch it with someone you've known for a while who you are about to reveal your feelings to. One guy and the four loves of his life. This turned out to be a surprisingly good little romance with touches of humor. Kevin Kline seems to growing gracefully into more senior roles, and Rachel Weisz, Elizabeth Banks and Isla Fisher are all comfortable enough as Reynold's love interests. If it's got young people with good teeth on the poster, the title is a bit twee and the font is in pastel shades, chances are, it's a romantic comedy."
6611,"( Excluding voice overs) The special effects alone are amazing. The special effects are very good, as well as the action scenes. The performances here are decent, although not captivating. The moment the Grace family moves into the dilapidated Spiderwick Estate, strange things begin to happen. The running time moves along fairly briskly and the film is involving and interesting from the start and keeps it's energy and charm throughout the running time."
6860,"The acting is good enough, with the Christian Bale look - alike Caviezel, and the great but short performance of Ron Perlman, it manages to be captivating. Outlander is worth a look and even if you don't like it, you can't deny how perfectly it defines the so - bad - it's - good adage. James Caviezel was excellent as usual as was Sophia Myles - to think of it, there wasn't a bum note in the cast and the script was fine. Outlander is the living proof, that such a combination can result in a very good and entertaining 115 minutes. The basic plot is quite sound and for the first 40 minutes the movie is VERY gripping."
6920,"Opening credits are hilarious with the "" you want to be a lawyer "" vignette. Writer / director Sean McGinly does a fine job for his first big production. However, this is a good film worth watching and definitely should be shown as an example of outstanding acting from Malkovich to Star Trek actor George Takei. This was nicely done and an interesting possible allusion to Wm Shatner's humorous attempts at singing. He is a classic 70s Vegas magician, doing fascinating tricks and metal feats of amazement."
8541,"The use of "" threes "" is deftly threaded throughout the film. Irrespective of how many "" meaningful "" and heart - warming tunes you embed beneath your "" dialogue, "" you need a foundation of a story that at least has a modicum of substance. And Cameron felt like he was just there to be there, though he would have made an interesting foil of sorts for Andre. Anyways, they invited these four gay guys with four unique personalities "" just for fun . "" It's just a nice 84 minutes with a big pink bow tied in the end."
6823,"This happens in several impressive moments in the latter half of the film. Rebecca Hall is delicious and demure, constantly filling scenes with her elegant presence. Toby Jones is fantastic in a small role â€“ instantly memorable; and Rebecca Hall builds on a series of strong performances. In Nixon strange emotions were brought up towards the man himself, in here Nixon seems to be quite a very good man. He matches the skill he showed in Lawn Dogs and Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind here and it is great to see him back at his best."
6811,", both the subject--a seminal recording label--and the performances make this electrifying entertainment. IMDb reviewer Davo Sambo has rightly pointed out the most blatant inaccuracies that this film carries. : -) Although Leonard Chess is almost more like a host here than a well - drawn character, Brody nevertheless works well with the cast and has great chemistry with BeyoncÃ©. In fact, he gets a good amount of on screen love action, including a nude scene with the fetching Chriqui! Beyonce Knowles is very beautiful and pays worthy tribute to Etta James, the singer she plays."
6696,"Holding you in a tight breathtaking grip with its interesting visual techniques, humor and acting. More importantly, he delivers an excellent (and unexpected) line that rivals Samuel L. Jackson's memorable expression from Snakes on a Plane. You feel a sense of amused wonder and curiosity throughout, and all the plot twists that follow are different enough from the source to actually hold your attention without ever being prematurely obvious. The action is well done, the effects look great, but its another case where you are lucky not to have an epileptic fit by the first hour from all the flash cutting and gimmicks. As bullets curve, heads get punctured, hilarity ensues, and rats explode (peanut butter rocks, BTW), you'll smile besides yourself."
6731,"The four subplots entwined by an apparently magic pair of jeans are good, but Carmen's one is certainly the more engaging. Maybe people didn't listen enough or didn't quite understand what wasn't said but overall, everything fell right into place. There's also some impressive input from supporting performances, such as the great Blythe Danner and the heartfelt Shohreh Aghdashloo. That film had zest and a breath of fresh air with one specific story affecting the lives of others. But all the girls are a pleasure to watch on screen, they make you laugh and just have a great time with their journeys."
6863,Except this one exceeds it by far in terms of pointless sadism. Eden Lake masquerades as a touching and dark film BUT it is quite the opposite. Somehow in a huge forest the kids could hear everything and were only ever just around the corner?
6814,"That said it is still much better than most programmes on television today and is well worth watching. Even after thirteen years, the claymation is so good. This of course made expectations higher than usual and putted on pressure on Nick Park and the rest of the crew. Sally Lindsey was impressive as Piella Bakewell, and Peter Sallis still proves that at 87 he could still do a competent job as ever as Wallace. But while the animation has improved, there isn't as much humour in this short as the others."
6865,"The acrobatic scenes on the building and the fight are the best scenes, even if ripped from Ong Bak and The Protector, but it's good to see there are many people capable to do this. The scenes with the elephants are really awesome too! Impressive fights and embarrassing acting, the whole thing was spectacularly shot. The fighting sequences are remarkably well crafted, with various interesting settings like an ice factory, a butcher shop and the ledges and neon signs outside a multi-story row of buildings. Breathtaking combats filled with bounds and leaps, Knock - outs, punches, kicks."
6607,"Those jump scenes by the way are nicely done. It did bring up some interesting points, like real world superpowers. The action sequences are fun, fast and frequent, the visual effects are cool and there's never a dull moment due to the films super fast pace. The other performances were sound (Samuel L Jackson's hair included) with Jamie Bell particularly outstanding as the nervy Griffin. The answer, of course, will probably be' No' as this film seems to have been made with the idea of sequels firmly in sight."
7051,""" F--ing brilliant "" claims AICN, Etc, etc. . The movie does a great job with cinematics and pacing. It's an interesting premise, and the film looks artistic enough in shot choices so you know it's not an over glossed, pre-packaged, Hollywood, cooking cutter film. So eventually it's up to one guy to be the voice of reason and make everything right. Fans of extreme cinema will no doubt enjoy "" Deadgirl ""."
7052,"The interaction between the two leads was very fluid. All in all, very well done, and ALL the characters are engaging and likable. The characters themselves are all very vivid and unique adding different emotional layers to the film itself. Larry Fessenden and Dominic Monaghan are just delightful as the graverobber Willy and his apprentice Arthur. Some parts are scary and funny at the same time."
6824,"That's where Winslet really shines. Their performances are jaw - droppingly brilliant. Their early scenes are powerful and presented with a strong sense of realism and brevity. Winselt and Kross bring this picture together. Choice is key here, and some choices are carry a bigger weight than others."
7057,"Both have O. Henry - type twist endings that make them ultimately entertaining. Other than one episode in Brighton Beach and one in Chinatown, the action takes place in well - heeled sections of Manhattan. Shia LaBeouf stars in the oddest segment of them all, along with the beautiful Julie Christie. BenoÃ®t Debie's sharp cinematography at least brings a consistent sheen to the film as it tethers the various story lines to a New York that feels mired in a cinematic fantasy. Israeli - born French director Yvan Attal epitomizes this feeling in two episodes."
6800,"What Luhrmann does well with Australia is tap into the majestic allure of the outback, and amplifies it. Baz Luhrmann has done a great job with' Australia'. It had terrific sets and was a beautiful setting, it felt like watching one of the old classic movies that made you feel good. Definitely the most over-blown of the past few years, and should win quite a few Razzies. Stylised backgrounds, unique, visual approaches, and a sense of humour that is truly Luhrman, flood the film bringing a rich Australian environment."
6650,"That way the movie will exceed your expectations. Serious or more intimate moments had darker shadows while remaining colourfully vibrant. It's rated PG and appropriate for all ages. A lot of the visuals really are beautiful bursts of color similar to what you find on the busy streets of Tokyo, and this movie is aware of that. With the warm performances of Hirsch, Goodman, and Ricci, you get transported into another world (isn't that the point of movies anyway? )"
6810,"Bobby is played by Michael Fassbender, who gives a quietly powerful performance. McQueen captures his scenes in jarring compositions, with all the skill and artistic imagining of a true artist. The cinematography and direction are assured, moving slowly and unexpectedly, always beautifully even in its darkest and dirtiest moments. McQueen's camera is an unflinching witness to the squalor and cruelty, and with the vivid imagery and forceful sounds it is almost possible to smell and feel the frightening environs of the film. The acting is excellent, particularly from Michael Fassbender who is quickly emerging as a massive hot prospect."
8496,"Viewers should be able to recognize "" Ghost In The Shell "" as "" Innocence ""'s predecessor from the title, the story and promotional material. As a subject it is one of the masterpieces of modern sci - fi. If you are going for more philosophical aspects, like the source of the self, the true spring of identity and consciousness, that is at the very heart of the story. Still, the camera angles and some of the ways they showed the world felt very classic to the anime style of the late 1990s. There were little scenes where they would do a bit more of the CG and half of it is rather pretty."
6614,"Same with the gorgeous palace settings. On the other hand, the film is engaging and the costumes lovely. A lot of the credit must go to the performances, which range from accomplished to fantastically enjoyable to watch. Their previous roles and their public images make Portman and Johansson perfect fits. The costumes also should win something, anything."
6928,"The film seems to move effortlessly between realistic scenes and those that are surreal and fantastic --- in all senses of that word. Beautiful scenes, good acting, great concept / plot, absolutely rapturous music. A quite appealing little film that stays with one long after it has concluded and raises the spirits. The musical numbers are few, but effective and carried out by a well - selected cast. While much of the film's success must be attributed to Gustafson and co-writer Cory James Krueckelberg, one cannot underestimate the exceptional cast."
6929,"It was interesting to see that the audition process, with callbacks, went on for months. First of all, a documentary about the genesis of A Chorus Line in the mid-1970s and its impact makes sense - certainly it is a pillar in Broadway history and deserves that sort of attention. Usually documentary movies are focused on big issues, like AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE and FAHRENHEIT 9/11. The film had a good balance of the history of the play, the past performers and performances, and the new hopefuls. The device of looking at the creation of A CHORUS LINE through the process of the auditions for a revival of A CHORUS LINE works very well indeed, and everybody with grease paint in their veins will respond."
6542,"and so many more hilarious surprises. This is something Gondry is very good at. The performances are heartfelt and fantastic. Some moments are very funny, others not so much, but this is not supposed to be a Farrelly Bros. kind of flick. Michel Gondry's screenplay is impeccable."
6639,"The performances by Jack White and Buddy Guy are interesting. But the Stones have an exceptionally solid history nonetheless, with Keith Richards and Mick Jagger, who met at the age of four or five in Kent, still after 45 years together not only the creative center but the center of enthusiasm and joy of performance. That one is a true duel--and it's astonishing to see the youth of Guy's face, alongside the deep creases in Jagger's, given that he's nine years older than Mick. The two cameras behind the front row of people give a great sense of being in the crowd looking up at Jagger and Richards. There is a recording of the concert by itself, including a few extra songs."
6645,"Some films are good, some are bad, and some are sort of like miracles. All in all, this comedy is just another example of a good time for adults. The character has lots of great scenes and lines, capitalizing on the characters seeming insatiable libido. Now, just three years later, that name has become almost a stamp of comedy quality, with such films as Knocked Up and Superbad following on the heels of The 40 Year Old Virgin. That out of the way, the pic was pretty affable, containing more than a handful of good laughs as well as more than a lot of generally comically captured sex scenes."
6868,"Paltrow is this critic's idea of silver - screen heaven. So, a smart, romantic "" dramedy "" with wonderful performances. Soon thereafter, Leonard stumbles into Michelle (Paltrow), an energetic blonde who moves into an apartment on the floor above. There are interesting shots, exotic locations (Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, NY), very good acting. until supreme suffering simultaneously walks into his life: Her name is Michelle, and she's played by the exquisite Gwyneth Paltrow."
6930,"Rian Johnson - The film had some very good elements: - The visual look was terrific. Not to mention the glorious performances, especially form the magnificent Rachel Weisz. Adrien Brody, Mark Ruffalo and Rachel Weiz are just amazing through out the movie. Mark Ruffalo is charming and a ridiculous ball of fun. Or, you know, if you just like good movies"
8416,"That meant using musicians who could deliver quality recordings within a minimum of studio time. And with each gold record, their individual and collective reputations soared higher and higher. their stellar performances marketed to the public as the work of popular bands. They were the machine that all but guaranteed success for recording artists, and the producers of rock / pop stars knew that. This film instantly becomes one of four documentaries highly recommended for those who want to better understand the music biz."
8408,"The comeback is partially successful with It's Bad for Ya! The last 25 minutes is the best this special has to offer. This was his best since "" Jammin' in New York "", and as it turns out his last. It is as if the New Millennium and Post 9/11 America was trampling George's spirit. At 70 Carlin bounces back from the level of despair (and some of the stumbles in the act itself) from Life is Worth Losing to a special that is firmly structured but loose and playful - or as much as the "" old f *** "" can get - and is continuously, ceaselessly, funny."
6660,"There are also a lot of smaller scenes to be enjoyed, focusing on the relationship between Downey and Paltrow and the development of the Iron Man armour. Iron Man is a spectacular and funny popcorn ride that not only has great action scenes, but also some great actors. Without any doubt, of all the superheroes that exist, Tony Stark is the coolest person there is! Billionaire and genius Tony Stark â€“ with a personality vaguely based on Howard Hughes â€“ is a weapons inventor that gets captured by bad guys in Afghanistan. As great as everything looked, what really drives the movie is the emotional resonance and down to earth nature of the plot."
6798,"at 82 minutes it is a perfect length for a refreshing jolt. It's a fun way to spend 80 minutes. The production value here looks as good as many Hollywood movies, and the "" monster "" is done particularly well. Still, the animators and producers did a fine job at making a gritty creature. If you have a chance, check out this beautiful barrage of B movie basics, disguised as a much better film."
6652,"The director has done a superb job with this production; it is packed with intelligent, witty dialogs and convincingly drawn characters. "" Happy - Go - Lucky "" is a really good film, if you stick with it. Even the two dimensional characters have good aspects for which they are easily forgiven. Rather, Poppy is wise and strong, trying to see the positive in everyone and everything. An enjoyable social life, memories of travels past, a cool reetro bike (for a while, at least . )"
6709,"That said, Ms. Zenovich is a talented filmmaker. A lifelong French citizen and a member of the AcadÃ©mie des Beaux Arts, he is part of the cultural establishment there, and he has received frequent European awards. But he is rich and famous, and then he can hire flashy lawyers, and he can make deals and buy justice. He is the consummate "" filmmaker's director "", and has made many excellent films--some of the most important films ever created--for over 40 years. This becomes the pursued theme of Marina Zenovich's documentary feature Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired, an above average film that is more informative than entertaining."
6663,"And enjoy this ninety - minutes show. Liam Neeson is such a great cast for the main character, he delivers an outstanding performance. Liam Neeson in one of his best performances. Liam Neeson does a great performance, perfectly interpreting his role of a former spy. If you like the Bourne titles then you will love this movie."
6719,"Stephen Dorff, Marisa Nichols carried it really well. The characters in the film are very realistic. truly one of the great films of this century. it will make everyone who watches it appreciate everything in their life so much more. Val Kilmer is great and Stephen Dorff is great as well."
6585,"The layered characters Jane and Kevin are very real. 27 Dresses wraps up all the plot lines in one neat sequence that is a truly worthy finale. The ending, which features a lot of dresses, is sweet and symbolically complete. Katherine Heigel is likable, Judy Greer smart and funny, and James Marsden is charming, and everyone else serviceable. Judy Greer is brilliant and she owns all her scenes."
6797,"That is the beguiling aspect of Cantet's film. On the other hand, Cantet captures the real classroom dynamic. And since blends of documentary and narrative often represent the cutting edge today, Cantet's achievement seems a very up - to - date one. But what's positive about it is the vibrancy of the social dynamic and the fact that communication really does happen, with challenge and response ceaselessly on both sides. Cantet allows the viewer to study the process of educating a fresh class of bubbly and street - smart adolescent kids in a Paris suburban school."
6795,"It was pretty hilarious in some parts (George Lopez as Papi! ) Plenty of action, laughs, and occasional tears. especially with some interesting song choices, lol. The attack of the mountain lions is quite convincing. The story is recycled, but it's still a lot fun to watch and has some really fun scenes."
6640,"But the volunteers of this midwife to be filmed were not excluded if there is a problem; one of the births requires transfer so you see how that is handled as well. It is inspirational to women and partners and allows them to view different births including the preparation. Interestingly, after all the successful home births, the movie ends on one in which the child arrives prematurely and is in a breach position and thus must enter the world in a hospital room after all. Boy, they sure had a great big utopia 200 years ago! Everyone in America should watch this film, especially fathers and mothers - to - be."
6714,"It has plenty of surprises, and it doesn't over do it at all. The instant strength of this film that comes to mind is the great use of the 3D technology. The 3D really made it better. So, if you're interested in new techniques, go see it in 3D, it's an interesting experience. Brenden Fraser and co. were capable and amiable enough to pull it through."
6711,"Her performance is so professional and assured it leaves others standing. The dance scenes are great and well put together. The beautiful scenery, the cast and the songs. The script is mostly fairly deft, and there is a sprinkling of decent laughs. Equally brilliant was the way the extras (usually some Greek old women) were deployed throughout the movie."
7086,"Luis Fernando PeÃ±a was a real good choice for the main role, even if it wasn't a very challenging one. that develops throughout the movie, even a love story of sorts, and all this with cinematography and music that accents the whole thing just right. Because the Hispanic - oriented distributor Maya is buying the film and may finance a substantial stateside theatrical release, Rivera was saying in December, it may have a better fate than the mere straight - to - DVD issue Justin Chang of' Variety' predicted. On the positive side, the film is peppered with clever manipulation of language, satirical takes on American impressions of foreigners, jabs at the excesses of capitalism, and inspired blending of present and future. A good film that is not the greatest sci - fi ever but deserves higher marks considering the obstacles the production team faced."
6808,"The good parts: the film is beautiful to look at, in a "" Tim Burton "" fashion. Actually, all the leading voices - Buscemi, John Cusack, Molly Shannon, Sean Hayes, John Cleese, Jay Leno and more were all great. But the premise was nicely original, and the actors put in some good performances. It is right up there with Cars. For an animated film, it has exactly what you want: fantastic colors and colorful characters - most of them very funny and entertaining to view and hear - and a good story with some interesting twists to it."
6591,"All in all, a fantastic time at the movies. All movies now have great effects. Great job J. J. Abrams and company! If you keep that in mind everything will make sense and make the movie more pleasurable. The presentation is brilliant, the only music heard is in the party and at the ending credits and the special effects are some of the most seamless stuff you'll ever see in a film."
6826,"Serge Hazanaviciius, Laurent Grevil, Frederic Pierrot, Jean - Claude Amaud and little Lise Se' gur form a perfect framework for the two stars. The beauty revealed at its core is the result of action, not an attempt to tie up loose ends nor a deus ex machina. It is a French film, and one has to accept the parameters of French' intimisme'; as such it is wonderful. This movie succeeds in presenting believable characters through life - like dialogs and superior acting. Kirstin Scott Thomas stands out for such an understated performance, that when she does towards the end of the film show such deep emotion you are blown away."
6653,"Comparing "" Expelled "" to "" Religulous "", it's pretty quickly apparent that Religulous is the better movie. All interviews are interesting, but some are amazing and memorable. Plenty of laugh out loud moments (particularly the image of Jesus as a teenager, you will see). Although it still delivers some funny bits, the movie is much more subdued. His "" Religulous, "" directed by Larry Charles, is an entertaining, funny, angry, thought - provoking journey from the Al - Aqsa Mosque, Via Dolorosa, the Qumran Caves, to Stonehenge, Habibi Ana (and a Moslem Gay bar), the Vatican, the Holy Land Experience Park in Florida, the U. S. Capitol, Mormon Tabernacle, and many others."
6727,"In the end, you'll feel like Javier Bardem is the luckiest man in the world, Penelope Cruz is operating at the echelon of her appeal, and Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson, well, they'll always have Barcelona. PenÃ©lope Cruz was wonderful, vibrate and funny especially when doing the Spanish. You can feel Allen's mark on their mannerisms, but they all seem to disappear into these characters, that's how good they are. Much like the change from New York City to London invigorated Allen in "" Match Point "", this vacation to Spain has revived some of the director's more artistic aspirations. When Cruz finally arrives, her moody whirling dervish of a performance is the perfect spice to liven up the soupy proceedings."
6807,"Uplifting but real, the movie will inspire many married people to commit more deeply to their marriages. "" Fireproof "" finally puts together solid production values, mostly topnotch acting, and a very nicely written script that includes some clever plot twists. At first Cameron's character just goes through the motions, but as time goes by, helped by his parents and a fellow fireman, his love is transformed and renewed. The action sequences are exceptionally well done. A few good laughs are sprinkled in for good measure."
8112,"Collateral damage, chaos and confusion among U. S. forces are in the show because it really happens in warfighting. As in real life so in series the Marines are made up of unique characters, there are capable as well as dumb officers. harping on grooming standards during combat operations is so hilarious because it's so true! Regardless, the series is good because, although the series isn't a deep philosophical "" thin red line "", (judging by the demeanor and mentality of a lot of the soldiers in the film it would seem a bit unrealistic), it is an honest portrayal of the mindset, expectations, and mentality of these specific groups of soldiers."
6940,""" L'heure d'ete "" is a fine movie written and directed by Oliver Assayas. Beautiful acting by Binoche, Charles Berling, Edith Scob and wonderful directing and writing by Assayas. Assayas' didacticism this time is admirably straightforward, and at the same time, the ideas are presented in what for Assayas is an unusually warm context. Like objects displayed in the museum. The characters seem likable, but display an ordinary selfishness, and the film lightly samples the passions that make each of them tick."
6806,"Now Mark Herman's "" The Boy in the Striped Pajamas "", itself based on John Boyne's novel, is fit to mentioned alongside these two great films. The great success of the film is its simplicity, it does not seek to over analyse but simply allows the development of the characters to tell the story. The boys have a great friendship talking every day, enjoying the company. This is true, although to be completely accurate, all the actors would have to speak in German and the film would have had to be subtitled as a result. THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PYJAMAS, a movie from an Irish writer and an English director; everyone must watch."
6881,"Servillo's acting is worth the film alone, but all the great actors around him are perfect and clearly highly enjoying the project. So, the concerned party's opinion aside, everything speaks in favor of this ambitious, thought - provoking, stunning opus. True, Italy seems to award some kind of venerable status to some big criminals that got away with it, one way or another. The acting performances are excellent, particularly Tony Servillo as the said Mr Andreotti. Andreotti is above the politics, above the Church, above finance, above mafia, he is depicted as a power that stands on its own, someone who uses all the different leverages to rule."
6793,"It was very funny seeing Sam in corn rows and with the gray in them. Samuel keep on making these wonderful movies. Which, of course, is most fitting considering the moments that lag in the script. If it wasn't for all the problems it had, this movie would have done much better than it did and it is without a doubt, worth watching. Thankfully, he has a great co-lead to work off of, as Samuel L. Jackson, too, has a really adept comic timing and way of bending around the script when it can work best."
6597,"The story contains a few original twists as well as a few serious implausibilities. Nevertheless, the direction, pace, and performances, especially Lane's and Bill Burke's, draw you in and by the abrupt conclusion, you are on the edge of your chair. The fact that the story gives him such amazing capability to the point that you occasionally start rolling your eyes should in no way deter from his acting. The best part of this movie is that it doesn't go for cheap scares, such as something jumping out or ominous music at key points in the film. Untraceable was a suspenseful thriller with great action, fun death strategies, and wonderful acting, that has a ridiculous amount of unappreciative reviews and hate aimed at it in all the areas that a lot of people have no problems with in other movies."
8078,"It's credible, exciting, captivating and worthy of multiple viewings. Each character is fully realized and distinct, the performances across the board stellar, with lead Jaime Winstone tough, capable and winsome. But because of Nyman's great gifts as an actor, he renders Patrick somehow magnetic. At about 140 minutes complete with "" previously on "" intros, this feels like one big zombie epic. Of the show's contestants, Joplin is the most memorable."
7693,"On the bright side, Russell Mulcahy is an experienced B - movie director, and the film delivers enough spectacle, with clear cinematography and some imaginative special effects (the best being the transportation from the labyrinth to Hades). Although it's set in a period "" long, long ago "", most of the characters look, talk and act VERY contemporary. Everything, yes, absolutely EVERYTHING in SK2 is derivative--and NOTHING is done nearly as well as it's been done in previous sword and sorcery epics. THAT very well could be the only method that lot has of effectively entertaining anyone with this movie. But the young fella and whatshercuteface were actually pretty good, and the scribe guy wasn't so horrible either."
6882,"There are some good parts of the movie. The cinematography is breathtaking, with huge elaborate sets that are used to their fullest. The cinematography is frequently gorgeous, the performances are stellar, and the action is kinetic â€” There's just too much of it. The sets and props really added to the movie's visual appeal. The action scenes were pretty decent as well."
6792,"The two have pretty good chemistry, even with all their awkwardly close moments. The makers know this, so they make the best of it. It really reminds you of road movies in the late decade such as Road Trip, Euro Trip, etc. and delivers the normal Superbad kind of content. The climax got really over-the-top, but it did continue on with the laughs, and was satisfying. He is the typical ass hole older brother in these kind of movies, but he pulls it over very well."
6827,"and the acting and performances were nuanced, layered and authentic. It was touching on so many levels. Excellent work by Mr. Will Smith. It's almost hard to believe so many loose ends could be tied up as it nears its ending, but it does, and it does so beautifully. the acting, the music, the directing and especially the beautiful story."
6884,"It's a nice straight to DVD action flick which will give you 1 , 5h solid entertainment. If you have none than "" Far Cry "" will surprise you. Both make fun of almost everything, and are more phlegmatic in nature. It is still not good but it is at least watchable which is an improvement over the bloodrayne. The second strong element are the action scenes which are actually pretty decent and fun to watch."
7107,"And if you work for Comcast, please put this movie on OnDemand! It's a movie that defies expectations and provides a refreshing injection into a genre of movie that has become increasingly tired as of late. The story pays a respectful homage to horror greats like Night of the Living Dead and 28 Days later without ever becoming clichÃ©. A body count in the millions has decimated Ontario's population. Lisa Houle gives an impressively measured performance as Mazzy's harried co-worker, managing to defy' damsel in distress' stereotypes by being a fully capable and independent individual, yet with an appealing vulnerability equally driving home the credibility of her character."
6791,"The good news for some is that Saw V feels natural and consistent to its recent predecessors helmed by Bousman, yet for many others this won't be something to get excited about. For those who attend screenings of the latest Saw movies only to watch people get their comeuppance through a series of bloody and grisly tests, then this will be where your thirst is quenched. This of course will please those looking for a continuation of the previous instalments, but it will undoubtedly feel too stagnant and jaded to interest anyone else. The Saw films have demonstrated an unfeasibly high success rate over time in terms of pulling off twist after twist and having them nearly all hit home. Clever, deadly traps, uncomfortable situations, & of course, the "" twist "" at the end."
6886,"In classic fashion, it is over-cocky hero Captain Hammer (Nathan Fillion who worked with Whedon on "" Firefly "") who seems to always interfere with both of Dr. Horrible's objectives: being evil and Penny. Neil Patrick Harris is absolutely inspired as the not so horrible, Dr. Horrible. Well, yes, and then again, Mr. Whedon can't leave anything as simply fun. Nathan Fillion delivers just the right balance of likability and swarminess. It was very interesting the way Whedon made the protagonist the villain, and the antagonist the hero."
6828,"All around great performances and great direction. What makes the whole thing endurable is the unmistakable signs of self awareness. Darren Aronofsky is definitely someone to watch and to follow. The Wrestler is impressive for all its smaller parts as well as the larger ones. It is in this fashion that the film jumps through all the mandatory hoops of its genre (think, of all things, The Royal Tenenbaums), yet still manages to seem fresh and realistic."
6786,"The scenes with him and Mintz - Plasse are watchable. As they spend more time together however, they realize they have a lot more in common than previously assumed; and suddenly start changing each other's habits for the better. The laughs were frequent and hearty. The screenplay is helmed by four minds, with Paul Rudd providing his personal touch for the first time in his career. Directed by David Wain, maker of The Ten (funny cult film), and written by Wain and Paul Rudd, this film is hilarious."
6785,"One of their scenes, alternately surprisingly tender and genuinely shockingly callous, is easily one of the very finest moments in the entire history of the series. Bond films in particular are known for their history of spectacular action and stunts, and if you briefly consider any eighties Bond film, you'll recall that somewhere in it was a long, held shot of something amazing. This film is about James Bond cracking down a multi-national corporation that works with dictators to get a share of precious natural resources. The performances are incredibly strong once again and there are some thrilling action sequences thrown in as well. Mention should be made of Judi Dench - she delivers another excellent performance as M. Would heartily recommend watching Casino Royale on DVD beforehand if you own it, specifically to prepare and remind yourself of the odd plot point as they certainly will be relevant here."
6830,"The transitions from life stage to life stage and decade to decade are seamless. Everything on the surface of' The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' appears beautiful - the cinematography, the special effects, the make - up, the cast. A beautiful portrayal of the finer moments in life. Accompanying this is the beautiful and heart - wrenching score by Alexandre Desplat, which is absolutely flawless. Everything was top notch from the elegant directing to the subtly wonderful performances down to the magical score."
6831,"Carrey is back in form with "" Yes Man "". B. Carrey has definitely aged recently, and it's starting to show. And it has a great cast, many delightful scenes, a reasonably relaxed Jim Carrey and a lighthearted style. Carrey fans won't be disappointed and there are a lot of strong moments. Jim Carrey was also very good in this."
6790,"The work done by the actors was relatively decent, with a few small exceptions. Lindsay Lohan, Hilary Duff and Shia LaBeouf have left Disney. Unrealistic moments and scenes are embedded throughout the movie, Camp Rock sitting at the top of them all. Though, these select songs make this movie re watchable and marketable for Disney. The songs are all catchy and entertaining and unlike the unpredictability of a musical, when the characters sings: It makes complete sense."
6598,"The story is simple but solid, and works on several levels. Camera is beautiful, music is perfect and fits to the action scenes. Stallone slips back into the role with ease and his supporting players do an admirable job. It's better than the previous Rambo films. The action is visceral and downright gory at times surpassing the hard - core scenes of Omaha Beach in Saving Private Ryan."
6697,"Smith's charisma is enough to make anyone happy, and it's so easy to see why so many people love him. It's Smith's charisma, charm, and unwavering likability that ultimately save the film. Jason Bateman, who seems to be the bridge connecting the performances of Smith and Theron, is great as usual, and likable, marking a change from his recent turn in "" Juno "". If you are going because you like the cast and are ready to be entertained for 1 hour and 20 minutes out of your life, then it is definitely worth the price of admission. It was entertaining, took a unique take on the superhero thing, and didn't have an overt number of huge gaping plot holes or completely blithe dialog."
6720,"John C. Reilly and Will Ferrell are amazing. Secure, well - adjusted people are funnier than zany outcasts. See this one if you're a fan of films like Talladega Nights, Superbad and Walk Hard. If you loved the other movies made in this vein, then you'll surely like this too. It gives you hilarious jokes, stupidly funny scenes, it's one of those comedy's that so so often tries to catch you off guard and every time it absolutely nails it!"
6787,"The best of the three is Merde, the centerpiece by Leos Carax. The best that come to mind are Paris je'Taime and New York Stories. The always interesting Michel Gondry (yes, he's French) has the best segment. Shades of "" The Bedsitting Room "" can be found here, but Gondry's trademark visual style is in full effect, featuring some amazing special effects, and fun set designs. This collection of strange tales is interesting."
6599,"Some are downright "" average "" spoof movies, at best. It's been overdone and only appeals to people under the age of 9. You laugh at little midgets and farting! BASEketball Scary Movie 3 Sacry Movie 4 Not all of these are great. Top Secret The Naked Gun The Naked Gun 2Â 1/2 Hot Shots Hot Shots: Part Deux Kentucky Fried Movie (yes, its "" old "" but a classic none the less) Mafia!"
7122,"The overall design, atmosphere, the beautiful landscapes. The monsters are also fully realised and wonderful to watch in action. Animators have created an incredibly beautiful world here. Name any specific area for evaluating or critiquing a CGI film and "" Hunters "" is flawlessly top - notch. Watch it for the incredible animation, the breath - taking battle scenes and for a glimpse into a world that's unlike anything else you've seen on a cinema or television screen."
6890,"It's really nice to see that Jaa so capably expands into new realms and implements modifications to his strengths as a physical performer to yield refreshing, non-repetitive movies that are easily distinguishable from one another. Either way, there are a ton of memorable scenes. It has incredible production values and the level of detail is fantastic. Tony Jaa is back in his first directorial effort (co-directing to be more specific) and the man delivers everything you would expect from a solid martial arts flick, and then some more. As a film, it is much more accomplished than ONG BAK and TOM YUM GOONG."
7125,"Very brave choices and a great script. It will unsettle but for an intelligent thriller, it really is up there with the best in the past few years. At any given time there are at least three threads to the story, each of which keeps you on the edge of your seat. The Chaser is a gripping thriller from the beginning until a few minutes from the end. This film is a great gem, and follows on from some of the other greats in the genre such as "" Memories of a Murder "" which is a classic."
6817,"At least "" The Happening "" had its accidentally humorous moments. Klaatu certainly rocks that three - piece suit though. From the dynamic score penned by Tyler Bates to the often endlessly interesting photography of David Tattersall, The Day the Earth Stood Still gets most of its outer shell right, even if everything that lies underneath is a less than inspiring mess. You can see Exhibit A of it right here in this science - fiction "" classic "" film, a re-make of the 1950s hit movie of the same title. Reeves is an actor known for his alien - like, wooden style - which is why he is so often found in these kinds of films - and it suits his character adequately enough here."
6600,"The performances were also top notch. It was smarter, funnier, and as visually stunning as anything you can expect from either del Toro or Mignola. It's like the director was allowed to make everything as he saw fit; his vision is much fuller this time around. Just about everyone here is excellent, particularly Perlman with another excellent turn as Hellboy and the underrated Selma Blair as Liz Sherman. The fights are better and more thrilling and the monsters are way cool."
6726,"Some stretches were of the film were dragging on but still a good film. The gorgeous cinematography, and especially the strong performances by the two lead actresses, make this film worth watching. Frozen River is independent film - making at its best, both vital and timely. Courtney Hunt's dÃ©but feature, "" Frozen River "", winner of this year's Sundance's Grand Jury Prize, is as tense as a great thriller should be, and also a heartfelt, poignant drama. Hunt's writing / directing is secure and reveals a very promising talent, but the film's major strength is the extraordinary performances of the lead actresses, in particular Melissa Leo ("" 21 Grams "", "" The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada ""), magnificent character actress turned lead."
6694,"Plus the cameo appearances by both Stan Lee and Robert Downey Jr where terrific! Lettier does an amazing job, Norton was fantastic, and as far as a comic book movie goes, this one is just about on top with little nods and mentions. Enough references to the true comic, alternate comic, and TV show, that everyone in the sneak peek seemed to be pleased. Ang Lee's film was, to be fair, admirable in its scope and ambitions â€“ it wasn't your typical comic book action film. In 2003, Ang Lee's Hulk was released to commercial success â€“ breaking box office records for a June opening and smashing its way to the top of the box office, it outperformed many analysts' expectations and was well on its way to becoming one of the biggest comic book films ever produced."
6633,"Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. His performance is truly terrifying, chilling, brilliant; any synonyms of the previous adjectives. Wally Pfister's cinematography is simply stunning. Here, as Harvey Dent (and later Two Face) he is very powerful. There is no doubt about it, one of the most anticipated movies of the 21st century duly deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it."
6725,"Like so many great movies that became dragged - out trilogies, the newest Mummy falls right in. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weiz lit up the screen with his charisma and her likability factor. Maria Bello looked goofy and miscast and the actor who plays their son makes Hayden Christensen from the Star Wars films look like an Oscar winner. It was a film of epic proportions. Fraser and Weiz returned (having made an offspring) and warbled, walloped and crashed through the bustling busy streets in a less than original screenplay but at least maintained their charm and kept the spark glowing from the first film."
6784,"Prepare yourself to be overtaken by emotions as varied as joy, pity, happiness, anger, revulsion, surprise, and an exhilarating conclusion rarely seen in movies anymore. There are some strong emotions in the film, and Boyle's direction keeps the film dynamic and engaging. He transcended genres and created a truly unique and energetic picture. The raw style mixed with the amazing locations make this film one of the most cinematic experiences you'll ever see. There performances moved many to tears."
6832,"The performances from this exceptional cast are first rate. Schickel, Ebert and the L. A. Times got it right. Valkryie perfectly illustrates how the smallest of things can have the biggest impact. People have different tastes and that's good. He did what had to be done but he could have elevated this movie like he has done to others in the past."
6601,""" In Bruges "" is hilarious, contemplative, sometimes scathing, often nihilistic, but marked by a shockingly hopeful undercurrent while tones shift and the colors of the human condition undulate in McDonagh's insightful light. If anything, enjoy it for the witty dialogue. Strong work also from Brendon Gleeson, who all will recognize from "" Gangs of New York "" and the Harry Potter series. From there things continue to go south as Ray and Ken get into all sorts of messes and meet strange characters, all of whom will play a part in the larger picture. Like the other characters, it is not portrayed as light, airy, innocent or picturesque, the way it is in real life."
6782,"It looks terrific and really feels like the 1920s in Los Angeles. And the 20's and 30's look to the movie was so realistic. All of the child actors were very well cast and all delivered amazing performances. As in every Eastwood production, the values are first - rate, in this case period costuming and vehicles (those Model T's and trolley cars are beautiful). It is all framed with an expert hand, and it is anchored by the very powerful work by Jolie and the rest of an amazing cast that brings to life emotions such as madness, anger, pain, sorrow, and many times, disbelief that humans can be capable of such terrible actions."
6613,"Better than a lot of comedies. FINAL VERDICT: If you like "" you might be a redneck if "" jokes, then this movie is right up your alley. But it's more entertaining than the majority of made for T. V. capers you see these days. Likewise, Ivana Milicevic, Eric Roberts, Joe Mantegna, Jenny McCarthy and a whole host of other comic actors throw themselves into their roles with a great deal of abandon and aplomb. The humor is broad (to put it mildly), but it is more often fleet - footed than flatfooted, and the whole enterprise is so dopey and good - natured that you may just find yourself chuckling right along with all the goofiness - provided, that is, you can put your brain on hold for the full hour - and - a-half that the movie takes to play itself out."
6605,"However, there are some incidents that will make you laugh and laugh. This movie was fun, and sweet, and everything you'd expect from this cast. It's campy, silly, and bright, and there is nothing like a fluffy romp around the sunny islands to cure those winter blues. McConaughey, Hudson and the other supporting characters deliver more than adequate performances and Donald Sutherland is as brilliant as he can be considering the overall quality of this movie. Kate and Matthew have the chemistry they had in "" How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days ""."
6781,"The colors and the detail are just amazing! Cohen (as Julien) has an obvious knack for comedy, and delivers every line perfectly for two movies in a row; not bad at all. Well, so far "" Madagascar "" is two - for - two in the laughs department. There literally are at least 8 plots happening at once â€” some of them are good, some of them aren't. It's a great family film and is fun for both the kids and the adults as well."
6780,"One of the best cartoon movies ever! In conclusion, this is by far the best longer - addition Futurama produced to this day. That twist resulted on one of the best comedies the TV has ever produced. Futurama: Bender's Game was certainly worth the viewing pleasure and with Matt Groening at the helm, you cannot miss. Matt Groening had spawned another winner with Futurama: Bender's Game."
6779,"And this is a' wonderful' achievement pressure to put on children and adolescents. But in HSM, some of it are performance scene. As before Tisdale is fun and bitchy without being unlikeable and she works well with Grabeel. Rolecomposition is cleverly put together, so that the largest minorities with the highest purchasing power are represented: Blacks and Hispanics. The dance sequences are much more complex, the songs are much more well performed."
7145,", but it also goes for deep moments and resonance, and Rosenthal strikes some good ground here. Don't expect a strict narrative and some of its best moments are just that - moments in time. The city landscapes and city spots are also lovely. Australians including Geoffrey Rush as the Angel and Anthony LaPaglia head up a solid voice cast. The Claymation (augmented with CGI) is interestingly done, with an oddly effective sculptured look to the characters."
6691,"Directed by Marcos Siega (Pretty Persuasion), the movie works on both ends. His face, and the many expressions it can make, are perfect for both drama and comedy, and he seems perfectly willing to commit to both extremes. A quirky, surprising little gem from writer Daniel Taplitz and director Marcos Siega ("" Pretty Persuasion ""). Chaos Theory is a well - acted comedy that delivers laughs a the right moments while weaving an endearing tale. He clings to controlling everything because it brings order, which gives him a sense of comfort and peace of mind."
7721,"It's an amazing five minutes. The colours have so much vibrancy and warmth and the backgrounds are smooth and elegant. "" Presto "" has all elements of a perfect crowd pleaser. UPDATE: LA MAISON EN PETITS CUBES was the winner this year. Its sweetness is quintessential Disney stuff though, and its a great little addition at the start of WALL * E. Don't miss it!"
6778,"Guy Ritchie's career has run red hot and ice cold over the yrs. A quick list of things it shares with Lock Stock and Snatch would read thus: fast paced, witty dialogue; complex, interwoven plot threads; central McGuffin driving the mayhem (# 1 antique shotguns, #2 huge diamond, #3 a lucky painting); smart, rapid editing; a mountain of Cockney crime stereotypes. Finally, Toby Kebbell eerily essays the most commanding character on screen as allegedly deceased rocker Johnny Quid. Ritchie's directing is as proficient as ever, it moves at a merry old pace and the plot just about stays on the rails. Well done Ritchie, well done cast, Im up for the Real RocknRolla and when you see it so will you!"
6776,"Terrific performances by Voight, Emmerich, Norton, and Farrell. Colin Farrell, Edward Norton, Noah Emmerich, and Jon Voight all deliver great performances. Overall, this film is gripping, well acted, well directed and has an integrity to it that is often missing in films these days. There's just something in his eyes that draws you and sucks you in. However, after fifteen, twenty minutes, the viewer has the big picture of the events and sees many parallel dramatic sub-plots and the promising movie is highly engaging."
6774,"Well done Mr. Director, well done. Manuela Velaso was better in Rec, but Jennifer did a really good job. It was better than the remakes of Shutter, The Eye and One Missed Call, that's for sure. ' Rec' does a much better job, particularly when the reporter interviews each of the buildings residents. On this particular night, Angela and her cameraman Scott (Steve Harris) are doing a ride - along with the firemen of a local station in L. A., including Jake (Jay Hernandez) and Fletcher (Jonathan Schaech)."
6773,"Though good fun, the plot wavers into clichÃ© at the end and doesn't quite have enough punch to believe the arrival of British comedy is truly back. The perception of girl's views on boys is a stand out moment. Although the four young leads over acted at times, this helped to accentuate the drama of being a teenager. 2 - Boy meets girl, awww they're getting together, OH NO SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENED, oh, phew! After arriving home and throwing a full on tantrum which involves stomping on her costume, ripping photos off the walls and throwing all her teddy - bears onto the floor, Georgia takes a deep breath and announces to the family that she's going to be' more mature from now on'."
7153,"The interesting thing is that people were actually clapping at many parts. Actually, the same can be said for all the leads, Fran Kranz, Bonnie Sommerville, Brian George and Kathy Baker - all did wonderful work. But perhaps most impressive is that Shades of Ray is writer / director Jaffar Mahmood's first full length film to direct. It was very obvious in the writing that Jaffar knew this character very well, and Brian picked up that ball and ran with it. Extremely well written and directed; and the acting by all the performers was top notch."
6892,"Many of the subplots are left open, but not in a unsatisfying way and while featuring ups and downs along the way, Sunshine Cleaning manages to find a hopeful tone without being sticky sweet. Mary Lynn Rajskub is just plain fascinating as the lonely lady Blunt thinks she is helping. Reluctantly, Norah agrees to help and "" Sunshine Cleaners "" is born. While it's easy to sing the praises of Adams, and she's never been more endearing or relatable than here, Emily Blunt proves to be an excellent foil. Blunt, especially, is a treasure as the unconventional woman, haunted by past circumstances, and having trouble fitting into "" modern "" existence."
6949,"The characters all fit the description and it was a good length. The Clique is definitely worth the 87 minutes it lasts. Dylan Minnette and Vanessa Marano also did a good job. The characters are extremely easy to identify with, the plot is engaging without being convoluted, and the young actors are extremely talented. And the acting was pretty good for teen actors who are starring in their first movie."
6681,"It is just a litany of arguments against the arguments against steroids (intentional double negative there). The film was well done and showed both sides of this provocative subject. What is also very interesting about "" Bigger, Stronger, Faster "" is that the persons interviewed on both sides of the steroid question are not exactly portrayed as "" normal . "" The classic side effects of steroids (acne, uncontrollable anger, loss of fertility, etc.) are not only discussed but clearly displayed by the drug's defenders even as they argue against these afflictions. This film takes an honest view at steroids, and more importantly at the attitudes that push people towards altering "" what god gave them ""."
7454,"At best he has exploited words and concepts, which are shocking and taboo for a reason, just to get a few cheap laughs. He must take the word fagget as a dare and he has to make it funny as a straight man. So if this is your idea of "" great comedy "", then by all means sit down underneath this sewer pipe and enjoy Louis C. K.'s performance. He wraps up these topics in hilarious stories like he always does and he isn't afraid to talk about controversial subjects. There were a few bits and pieces of outstanding material."
6772,"Then, there are uniforms and a special saluting. Its a film that will definitely be spoken about and re watched by many repeatedly for many years to come. Gansel wisely shot this scene in a very realistic way: he makes it quick, surprising and ugly and this way he makes it feel organic stylistically. Neatly structured by days, the experiment begins with simple disciplines and grows to become an exclusive cult named "" the wave "" with its own uniform and salute. The Wave ("" Die Welle "") though looks at the issue from a different angle, examining how it can arise and entrance those it touches, and in the process makes the whole issue look fresh again."
6771,"The actors all do their parts brilliantly. Hoffman is brilliant in a role that utilizes his physical and acting gifts, and he takes the character through the spectrum of its possibilities. Every choice brings with it a million different consequences, some seen and others that go unnoticed. The film's very much Spike Jonze in style, but grander and more ambitious than Malkovich and Adaptation. Illness, death, transience, love, relationships, passion, devotion, art, theatre, identity, hope, so many topics dealt with in a painfully sincere way."
6770,"Even better than Brolin's part was Phedon Papamichael's photographic direction. Josh Brolin gives an excellent performance as W., and the supporting cast is generally superb, although Jeffrey Wright, Richard Dreyfuss, and James Cromwell particularly stand out. The film ultimately plays much, much better when Stone relies on actual transcripts and information gathered by experienced reporters, and those sequences, whether they are cabinet meetings, press conferences, or more personal moments, snap and zing. It might be interesting to people decades from now but at this point everything in the film is common knowledge and a lot of the things you see in the film you might as well just watch the original footage on youtube. The supporting cast is a hoot, with highlights including Thandie Newton eliciting big laughs just with her facial expressions as a wicked and moronically faithful Condi Rice, Elizabeth Banks giving a winning portrayal of Laura Bush, and Richard Dreyfuss playing Cheney as the most insipid megalomaniac American politics has ever seen."
6769,"Rogen is a big, doughy, lovable ball of enthusiasm and he's always fun to watch. Elizabeth Banks provides the perfect on - screen mate for Rogen. Rogen and Banks have great chemistry. But as dirty as the movie is, you will be surprised and delighted to find that this is a movie with a lot of heart, and as with all Kevin Smith pieces, a great deal of brain (no pun intended). You'll see familiar faces from both the View Askewniverse and the Apatow family, creating pure hilarity as both of these comic forces collide."
6893,"The bits with Po and his class are of the same quality as in the main film but the stories that make up the majority of the running time are delivered in a more hand - drawn style that looks cheaper (because, by comparison, it is). It teaches great virtues of human beings in an entertaining way, without being preachy. Either way the short is solid and entertaining with a solid if obvious moral message for the kids (and bunnies). it has some great lessons for kids, and it's kinda cute, especially the bunnies. The animation is great, especially the bunnies who are so cute and cuddly!"
6768,"There were still some really awesome action sequences though and it was definitely beautifully shot. It is a mystery film with some action scenes (and some very well done visual effects). He works his way up from person to person and every once in awhile, he has crazy dream sequences. What's further astounding is that the film can't even get the basics down. Max Payne was a game that was born of Film Noir and John Woo."
6818,"He is understated and believable as the man who wanted to change people's lives, focused on doing what he thought was right. It's amazing, and it's probably an unique case, how a single image can move millions, how the right moment, with the right publicity can be so powerful. The bravura Benicio Del Toro stars as Che and is quite excellent. Benicio del Toro brings a monumental performance as Che Guevara. His performance displayed how Che's spirit was able to superseded the hardships faced in the Cuban Revolution."
6721,"The Good: - Duchovny, Anderson, and Connelly all deliver excellent performances. Also good is Amanda Peet, looking smashing in her smart FBI pantsuits. It was "" The X-Files "" in blockbuster mode. ***** this comment may contain spoilers ******** Yes mulder and Scully are back. In the end some fine performances and a moody atmosphere do not add up to a good time."
6717,"That said, it equally has its moments of grandeur. Indeed, Cliff Simon gives his singularly best performance of Ba'al to date, and is without a doubt the star of the show. Given a bigger budget for this made for DVD movie, this movie has quality production values and well done visual effects. In short, this movie delivers what it promised: an epic SG1 adventure and a great character show. Totally worth the money, can't wait to own the DVD."
6765,"Immediately, and most strikingly poignant during the opening sequence, the City of Ember itself is a sight to behold; from the countless lightbulbs that give the city its light to the murky tunnels that run underneath to provide water, the production values present are superb. Great for kids, and great for folks of all ages who enjoy light adventure. It's a great kid's adventure, lots of mystery and action, good character development, and plenty of cool settings. With stunning visuals that complement the script's wonderful sense of imagination, fitting performances, and a very memorable, intelligent and socially relevant story, City of Ember is a fantastic slice of entertainment for all the family to enjoy. Jeanne DuPrau's book is an amazing trove of metaphors (candles, the library, the seed, the Pipeworks, and the city itself)."
6953,"He gives very astute and detailed re-tellings of his life. His recollection of "" Cus "" D'Amato is surprisingly moving. Director Toback does a brilliant job in letting his subject do all the talking, and it is riveting. And there's a lot of laughs. The interspersing of his fights with his dialogue is superbly done - credit to the the direction of James Toback."
6764,"There are twists and turns and it's a lot of fun. There are scenes where the film gets really dark and serious, and they completely work as well. Without his commanding and charismatic presence, the film would sink. "" Body of Lies "" is most definitely a cut above most in its (overall quite poor) sub-genre, and one of the biggest surprises of the year. DiCaprio just keeps getting better and better as he is now more able to lose himself in a role and successfully shed the pretty."
6763,"But the light shines brightest on Anne Hathaway as Kym, the ex-junkie, ex-alcoholic, ex-return rehab patient bordering on becoming an ex-family member. She's on the screen for a few minutes but her presence is extraordinary. While it's refreshing to see interracial marriages treated so casually (Lumet's grandmother is legend Lena Horne), Demme makes almost too big a point in presenting a global community though the diverse music and the wedding's multi-cultural themes. With a film more comfortable in the category of "" ensemble piece "", Rosemarie is the catalyst and pushes the energy along, changing and charging every one of her scenes. Recommendation: A powerful series of moments, filled with terrific acting, that don't quite come together as a film."
6954,"heard lots of good reviews beforehand. Further down the billing, Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes also give solid performances worth mentioning. While the storyline may be inaccurate when it comes to certain little details (as many war vets have noted), it's a unique one and allows for much more realistic and well - rounded characters. Kathryn Bigelow concocts a masterpiece of a film without tricks or gimmicks, at least none to be detected and that in itself is a triumph. The Iraqis are portrayed as crazy bombers and the solders are portrayed as independent thrill seekers."
6705,"The Wackness has some beautiful visual scenes. Do yourself a favor and go see The Wackness. Olivia Thirlby delivers almost an equally as impressive performance as Peck. Graffiti font is made as opening credits, respected by Levine, whose script is alive (also should get nominated) and direction is competent cool and quick in a drug - like haze. The true power of The Wackness however comes from the way it is written, and also the direction."
6657,"Due to their recent successes, it makes sense that SNL's comedians want to branch out into movies like they successfully did in the 90s with Wayne's World. Ratings are fairly high coming off of the writers' strike. Barry (played by Steve Martin), the president of the organic food company Kate works for, is an absolutely insane hippie that provides a lot of humor to the parts of the movie where Kate is at work. Sigourney Weaver is amusing in a smaller part, Steve Martin also has some funny moments. b) some sharp zingers in the script, with at least one every few minutes that will make you laugh out loud."
6804,"So, a dramatically more realistic Transporter movie but sucked dry of all the humorous and fun tone that made the previous instalments so much fun. They completely took the humour out of all the potentially very humorous moments through the more' arty' editing, over the top score dramatic score (soundtrack definitely plays a big part of the different tone in the 3rd movie) and generally lousy script. Valentina (Natalya Rudakova) has a nice touch of "" Nikita "", and plays wonderfully the captive girl half romantic, half moving. Fight scenes have something from the legendary Jason (Bourne) movies. As far as action films go it ticked all the boxes, plenty of guns, car stunts, good fights, romance and even some corny humour, and has a happy ending."
6896,"The moments and the way these songs lend themselves to the scenes are absolutely brilliant. Worth every minute of it's one hour and twenty minutes. Sita Sings the Blues is joyous entertainment. This is that rare film that appeals both to children and adults. Ms. Paley uses Sita's story as raw material, and uses Annette Hanshaw's recordings as raw material, to create something new and personal and totally contemporary."
6898,"The production values are excellent too. Also the lead actors Bleibtreu, Wokalek and Gedeck have delivered outstanding performances. A lot of locations, a great deal of main and supporting roles, hundreds of extras, good special effects (mainly explosions) and a set design and costume design which creates a very coherent 70's atmosphere: you can see that the film cost a lot of money. Martina Gedeck as Ulrike Meinhof does an excellent job, and her character has also been given the most depth and complexity of all the RAF members. The quality of the acting ranges from good to fantastic (with very few exceptions like Alexandra Maria Lara, who is nothing more than wide - eyed again and who thankfully doesn't even have dialogue)."
7436,It's nice to see but only after watching WALL - E. A welcome find on the DVD. Produced as a DVD extra for the movie Wall - E. This DVD extra isn't trying to the sort of brilliance that distinguished Wall - E. It's jut a cute shot that tells a story that runs concurrently with some of Wall - E. BURN - E is a short extra film that was packaged with the DVD of WALL - E.
6716,"Don't get wrong: there are a number of funny lines in here, the animation is great in spots, and some of the characters (i. e. "" Kilowatt "") are very appealing. The animation is so - so, the voices are decent, except some moments seemed a little stereotypical and clichÃ©. Although SOME bits were "" almost "" half - funny, most of the movie was portrayed through dull characters and not such a good storyline. When they do land on the planet, they meet some interesting creatures and have to save the planet since one alien, Zartog, wants to take over. Truth is, and a departure in animated movies of late, this one is sans big name stars or voice talent, and doesn't detract you away from the story, nor have one talent steal the thunder from the rest."
6612,"However, if you set your expectations right, you'll be surprised to turn out that you like this movie. Everything a entertaining mainstream movie has to have. The charming two leads and the lovable characters add as the cherry on top. The sequel to the popular "" Step Up "" was obviously not as good as the first (sequels and prequels never really are) but it was a fun film to watch. Briana Evigan (Andie) is an amazingly talented dancer."
6665,"There's also one or two moments that evoke memories of the original movie from years ago and fans should get a smile out of it. The real stand out of the supporting cast however is Currie Graham as Merrick, the double crossing IOA supervisor. While non-fans might want to watch the Prelude on the DVD to catch - up on all the plot lines going on in the film, fans should enjoy it. For those familiar with the SG1 series (particularly seasons 9 & 10) The Ark of Truth is highly recommended. The performances were top - notch, as Stargate has consistently provided over the past decade - "" regular "" and "" guest "" characters all."
6667,"Kutcher and Diaz and the others do a very good job. This is the setting for most of the film and it gives the viewer some really familiar every day situations pushed to the extreme, the interaction between Cameron and Ashton is working out well all through the movie, they really seem to be having fun acting their parts. Of course Cameron has a far stronger comedy--and general movie--rÃ©sumÃ©, so again Ashton's playing opposite her is not a step back but a step forward. But Aston and Cameron had some really good moments too. Yes there are 1 or 2 silly scenes but it was still funny."
6761,"It basically show the daily dealings with low - ranked bums and not so organized mafia and it's actually quite realistic. This isn't a disaster though, because the film is still fantastic in moments and the acting and cinematography are often superb, it's just a bit too vague on the whole to really capture your attention and make you care about the story. The film is a profoundly moving study of the low - level soldati and ordinary community members affected by the Camorran Mafia. But none of these 5 stories are connected very well besides it all taking place in Naples, Italy and has gangs called Camorra. It convincingly integrates international political questions, environmental issues, subtly moving psychological studies of ordinary characters, horrific violence, philosophical issues of loyalty, values and honour, and above all a totally new (for the Mafia film) cinema verite style of shooting into a magnificent whole."
6644,"Moves at a pretty good pace. While it's certainly not a masterpiece, The Ruins is just an instantaneous breath of fresh air. The performances from the cast are good. The script, written by Scott B. Smith based on his own novel, is pretty good. The fact that Four Beautiful Gen - X'ers are involved is about where the similarities end."
6760,"The central performances are top notch and Jessie Pham as the young Lucie is very convincing, completely holding your attention. performances, photography, editing, score, sound design, direction are all spot on. Recommend it (it won't be easy) and let's hope Martyrs gets the credit it deserves. It's beautifully shot, really well paced and contains outstanding performances from the two female leads. While it borrows the horror from films like A l'IntÃ©rieur and Haute Tension, the tone and effect of the film is much closer to IrrÃ©versible or better yet, Grandrieux's La Vie Nouvelle."
6803,"It is technically one of the worst films of the year, but the entertainment factor in the above respect keeps it out of the company of movies like Disaster Movie and College. There were some very good moments and some very "" eh "" moments. Stewart plays a great brooder, and she certainly did that here. Kristen Stewart is sort of the queen of not showing facial expressions, so she's perfect for the role of the awkward teen Bella Swann. Teenie Boppers are quite loyal, perhaps bubblegum will beef up their box office."
7297,"it is so beautifully acted, especially by Gustaf SkarsgÃ¥rd as Goran, the the doctor, and Thomas Ljungman as the kid up for adoption. The story is funny, dramatic and romantic and the trio Gustaf SkarsgÃ¥rd, Torkel Petersson and Tom Ljungman is charismatic and shows a great chemistry. Gustaf SkarsgÃ¥rd brother of Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd & Torkel Petersson as couple are great. Nice cinematography from Marek Wiesner and production design from Lene Willumsen which give the film a rich textured look. It's not an edgy film but is light and humorous with a some touches of drama without coming across as a message movie and it has an appeal to a general audience."
6759,"Peter Sollett is a delicate director. The perfection of the movie lives in its imperfections. The movie pretty much takes place during an entire night and Sollett's portrayal of night in the city is amusing and exciting. Ari Graynor's part is by far the funniest character of the bunch and Ari plays the part extremely well. While it can at times be too cool for school, it is the roughness around its edges that give it an unexpected and genuine warmth."
6659,"Lots and lots of closets: big closets, small closets, mirrored closets, closets to Narnia, so many damned closets you'll not want to dress yourself for another year. Prom Night is shot with the artistic eye someone gives while finely crafting a Lifetime original film. That on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises. It is not scary, nor engaging, nor is it satisfying enough to be "" funny "" like others on IMDb have claimed. The MOST you see is what looks like someone having taken a ketchup bottle and spraying it across a plastic sheet."
6757,"Kirsten Dunst looks quite cute here and delivers a charming performance. The middle was the best part, with a couple of laugh out loud moments. This was a good comedy & well worth checking out at the theaters. It is a well executed film that is rushed in the beginning and clichÃ©d in the end. Kirsten Dunst is a revelation - funny, sexy and real."
6643,"As for the humans, Abigail Breslin as "" Nim Rusoe "" is a cute, likable kid. Also, there is some sly humor, as in the scene where a hula dancer is stopped in mid-wave to escape an exploding volcano! Kids will love it and adults will be thoughtful enough to enjoy it. It's entertaining enough for impressionable minds to appreciate--if they can understand that the Alex Roper character is really a figment of Abigail's and Jody's imagination. Overall, though Nim's Island handled its material well, usually stayed within the bounds of acceptability in order to provide an entertaining, fun performance by Jodie Foster and Abigail Breslin."
6756,"The pacing, the tone, the emotion, the score, everything was perfect in this scene. The lighting was good on some scenes, but very much off on others. The gritty realism of the car chase sequence onto the cranes was stunning. Many times the camera is moving so much and the cuts are so fast you are not really able to see the full extent of the destruction or when and what will happen next. When the count begins to get into the double - digits, and even into the triple - digits, that movie simply can't be considered good entertainment."
6675,"Some really good action scenes, esp. Shia LaBoef is actually quite good and not annoying at all, he has some funny lines and scenes. The other prerequisite is that you've seen the other three movies. Should have made Indy IV 10 years earlier. One of the few bright spots was Shia doing the fighting instead of Indiana."
6674,"All the principals turn in solid performances. Seftel really gets you involved in all of the action and it pays off completely. Everyone gives a great performance (especially Joan Cusack) and there are some really great moments throughout. Assessing the technical aspects: - The acting (by the main characters, at least) was good, as was to be expected. Seftel crafted the film as perfectly as one could: he created a vibrant atmosphere, one that is both examines harsh reality and cartoonish falsities; - contrasting them perfectly - as well as making the film feel as if you were watching it all."
6754,"All three (Gervais, Kinnear, and Leoni) get big laughs and are utterly charming. Add in the performances of the three leads and you have a fully satisfying movie - going experience. Plus, linking the ghost plot with a living, breathing core, the movie brings both elements to a close effectively that capitalises on the development that was given to each beforehand. You'll get some laughs from here, Tea Leoni holds her own and Greg Kinnear has the hardest part in the entire film. Indeed, it is no overstatement to call Ghost Town riotously funny - the laughs come big and often."
6753,"The acting from Samuel L. Jackson is flawless. It was a pretty good movie, the performances were good, the plot was interesting and is very entertaining! Lakeview Terrace, what could have been a great thriller turned into a complete and total mess. Samuel L. Jackson has had a vibrant career portraying characters in two spectrums of the acting realm. The movie had some twist & turns, some good laughs and was pretty intense."
6751,"Some scenes were very good, some very bad, the scale is balanced. 78 : 1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5. Furthermore, colorful and granulated cinematography by Decha Srimantra, Pang brothers' usual. Fans of the filmmakers work and fans of action movies will enjoy it. It succeeds in building intrigue, tension and nice performances, thanks to the affecting acting of the girl who plays the deaf and mute, she's frankly marvelous."
6750,"It works and he plays the part brilliantly because he takes ridiculous dialogue and ridiculous material and has wild amounts of fun with it. A brilliant Noirist, Miller actually has much better luck in' The Spirit' in moments of levity. The visuals and art direction were amazing, strong cinematography, very "" Roger Rabbity "" sorta feel with the rotoscoping of some scenes, his tie, shoes, backdrops etc. . Sam L. Jackson is so over the top that it was painful. People will probably gravitate to the cinematography of Bill Pope which does its best to marry Frank Miller's Sin City with the pulp comics of The Spirit's origins."
6971,"With vampires, the movie is a bit more exciting and the special effects are ramped up. Rating: Acceptable and passable, this exciting adventure has all the imagination, magic and silliness this kind of amusing demands. They are each given delightful backstorys that are fun as well as convincing. Jane Curtin and Bob Newhart are back as Flynn's bosses at the magical library, and Curtin's role has been beefed up a bit. Geeks and friends of geeks will see much that hits home."
6749,"that those wonderful Brits mastered decades ago. Some bits are funnier than others, with a few running gags that recur throughout the movie. From the Hasselhoff bit to the mid-show Asian review to the d & d sketch, the Onion Movie is a rare breath of fresh air! While this movie is chock full of current - societal satire (which Python never was), it uses the clever segues to new scenes, the reappearance of characters you'd just about forgotten, and the absolute Absurdity (it has to be capitalized! ) If you enjoy movies like "" Scary Movie "" or "" Anchorman "" and TV programing such as "" MADtv "", satirical news shows such as "" The Colbert Report "" and "" The Daily Show (with Jon Stewart) ""."
6748,"Her Crystal is legendary, with conniving lines, incendiary moves, duplicitous maneuvers, and some very sexy poses. The reason that the original version worked so well was that the characters were dealing with "" man "" problems. Leachman is still an amazing talent that brings her remarkable charm and humor to the film, in the small role that she has. There is one glimmering hope in the film, however little it is allowed to shine surrounded by the dim and dying stars around it is Cloris Leachman. TV actresses mingling with models and Oscar nominees / winners."
6747,"The most amazing footage is the pre-Katrina scenes. It easily takes it's place among recently released documentaries on Katrina (' Camp Katrina', etc.). Speaking of the tourist trade, the French Quarter and Downtown where most of the tourists go are fixed right away. This powerful film is cinema verite at it's best. It turns out that the couple filming is a set of intriguing characters with admirable qualities."
6682,"Has the makings of being a classic. The animation is very rich and the colors are crisp and bright. Best line: Oogway regarding yesterday, tomorrow and today. One hilarious moment after another continues until Shifu recognizes Po's true driving force. Speaking of animation, the cinematography, character design and backgrounds are all done very, very well."
6746,"it was suspenseful, had great twists, the acting was superb, and was a great story. On the positive side, the acting in "" Traitor "" is uniformly great, without standout performances from Don Cheadle and Guy Pearce as the lead characters. After one of the better villainous performances of the year in Vantage Point, Taghmaoui delivers a performance just as deep and riveting as Cheadle's. Cheadle, Guy Pearce, Neal McDonough, Said Taghmaoui and Alyy Kahn are all fantastic in the lead roles. The first half of "" Traitor "" is quite compelling and effective as it establishes the characters and sets the story in motion."
7211,"And, through a number a picaresque episodes, she either does or doesn't (note: no spoiler here). The male characters are acceptable in terms of intensity. But definitely shown enough to emphasize the sexual desires of the character. After fruitlessly banging dozens of guys of varying temperaments and races and quirks, she finds Jaime and everything seems to be going along swimmingly. Though it is quick, it makes a point on the emotions of the female lead very well, the thoughts, expressions, disgust, disappointment are all captured really well."
6745,"The presentation of the near future world in "" Babylon A. D. "" is beautifully done. The action scenes were also enjoyable. They must really like classic cars. Babylon A. D. is the perfect example of suit and tie butchery; an artistic, intelligent piece of work obviously dragged down in the cutting room into an incoherent, clunkering mix of the genuinely interesting and the downright mundane. Enter Michelle Yeoh as the protector and chaperone to the package."
6744,"Selzterwater and Failburg once again have shown that they lack any sort of writing skill and humor. Movies are something you should enjoy, and this. If there's anything about it that's good, there's the 70 minute or so running time (where did they get 90 minutes? ) You will seriously feel ill afterwards and more than likely have a strong urge to gouge your eyes out."
6743,""" Burn "" grips and holds, surprises and entertains, it is a virtuoso piece. As usual, the Coens' dialog is a real treat. George Clooney is also terrific and the Coens move through their crossed purposes with speed and elegance. But in addition to this there were at least half a dozen really funny bits in it. Yes, there are betrayals (none better than the totally unexpected one at the end of the film), and there is rage, but all contained within a glorious bubble of writing - directing - acting excellence."
6722,"When those moments do come, they really are awesome and penetrating. In those moments, the faÃ§ade is pulled back and you see glimpses of real people in real life situations. Shows the pressures teens face today in a very honest way, full of raw emotion and real tears. Burstein followed these five kids and a good number of their friends for the entire 2006 scholastic year at Warsaw Community High School. In the documentary "" American Teen, "" which had its Regional Premiere here at the 2008 SXSW Film Festival on the heels of an auspicious Sundance debut, filmmaker Nanette Burstein chronicles a year in the life of a group of high school students from Warsaw, Indiana."
6741,"So even the messages of empowerment here are mucked up. This is the script Simpsons episodes are made to make fun of--remember the one where Homer has to return to college? The intelligent blonde comedy has some unrequited gems and shouldn't be entirely dismissed as a genre. Clueless works because you can tell Cher's mind is just a little too distracted by fashion, but once she gets the gears in her head rolling she's really a bright and compassionate kid. Overall, the cinematography, acting, and production values are quite good, though not of Oscar caliber (in spite of what some other reviewers have stated . )"
6630,"There is barely anything funny in this at all. The performances, are, of course, outstanding. This film won't appeal to everyone, but it does have some good one liners and funny moments. The DVD comes with a trailer. The film is certainly enjoyable, and has several laugh - out - loud moments."
6740,"From there, exciting vehicles chases scenes and blood ooze out. Surprisingly, Anderson rises to the occasion, effortlessly elevating a clichÃ© - rich but fast - moving script to the level of a satisfyingly adrenalin - fueled confection aimed like a bullet at the A. D. D. - addled brains of the short - attention - span generation. The script follows correctly an old tested and tried recipe, everything is at its place, and although you can easily plot out the whole course since the beginning, somewhat even this sounds good - you simply have the guilty pleasure of savoring again a story that you know from dozens of other movies. Also, Jason Statham, this guy is just awesome in action movies, he makes such a great lead in any action role and is such an awesome tough guy that you don't want to mess with. While anyone going into this film expecting anything more then a thin veil of a plot will be sorely disappointed, it will definitely entertain those who have the right expectations."
6739,"If you feel yourself mentally more mature than 15 y. o., go watch Let the Right on in instead of Twilight. The film, which details the bizarre misadventures of a pair of pre-teen star crossed lovers, one of whom is an androgynous vampire, is phenomenal in almost every regard. What comes next is a twisted tale of revenge and pubescent love, made with visual flair (the swimming pool scene is already classic), creative directing and impressive performances by the young pair of protagonists. Production values are stellar, with all technical aspects--lighting, original music by Johan Soderqvist, and Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography--combining in perfect synchronization to produce a Hitchockian tale that somehow brings love and light into what could have been the darkest drama imaginable. In this Swedish film, adapted from John Ajvide Lindqvist's bestselling book, director Tomas Alfredson dares to mix pleasure and pain in a way that is both horrifying and tender."
6624,"Also, Verne Troyer has quite the clever line--in the credits, that is. He's funny, sympathetic and believable; in short, everything this movie IS NOT. Movies that just aren't that great, aren't interesting, lack that certain spark that a Great Movie always has. Guru Pitka is a self help guru who is very successful, but he is ranked as the number two self help guru of the world. The funniest parts are gleefully juvenile, but they are, unfortunately, outnumbered by gags that are simply juvenile or, worse yet, juvenile and mean - spirited."
6738,"The colour gave it the right atmosphere of claustrophobia in open spaces and the background score is fabulous. Waltz with Bashir may not deliver everything you expect after seeing the trailers, but it is powerful. Israeli director Ari Folman's Waltz with Bashir is easily the standout film of 2008, with its surreal animation style and abrupt way of portraying such a horrific event. This gives the picture a feel that is both evocative and down - to - earth, a bizarre but powerful combination that has earned Waltz With Bashir comparisons with the similarly merciless Apocalypse Now. The real life persons are recorded while giving the interviews while extremely accurate drawn images play the visual role (one of the persons interviewed is a famous journalist showing up often on TV)."
7242,This is well - known DP Kuras' directorial debut. It's truly a heartbreaking story on many levels. This is a pretty good documentary as the layers unravel in a very nice and subtle way. That is how Thavi came to think of his family members and those like them. How Thavi got into filmmaking and where he acquired such good video camera's from?
6737,"There were some really spectacular scenes and vistas. It's not to say everything is realistic, it's a bit stylized and otherwordly like 300 for example. It seems as though the film makers settled on making it a pretty cool movie. Keep your expectations low and you'll enjoy it for what its! To say the least about this film, it ranks as a top notch SyFy Channel movie."
6615,"It's pretty short on story and pretty high on funny bits. The first half is great, as it applies a usual Will Ferrel formula - have a very basic plot to allow Will Ferrel and co to display their antics with really little attention to the plot. It has some of the fun ad libbed dialogue Ferrel's movies are known for and is one of those scenes you know will have outtakes on the DVD. Will Ferrell has made a bunch of funny movies already. This is a Will Ferrell comedy, everyone should have some funny moments."
6899,"Gervasi's work behind the camera is extraordinary. Two thumbs up, five stars , 4 thumbs up , 10 stars No matter the scale, this documentary gets the highest. The structure of this film is particularly engaging and - once again - Gervasi trims any unnecessary fat from what could have been a fan's - eye - view of Anvil. Lips' voice - over combines his almost trademarked acceptance with the tiniest glimmer of hope â€“ a hope which has never been totally extinguished in 30 years. What Gervasi has achieved is a truly moving, funny and uplifting account of a band's struggle for the recognition you can't help but feel they so richly deserve."
6736,"HPIH is very refreshing to see. Overall, its a beautiful composition and keeps one riveted, although lacking in frills. The characters are convincing and the story is heart - felt. The actors are absolutely brilliant and feel real - life. The music is well - chosen, touching and stands on it's own in little moments of self - reflection."
6735,"And the grand scale scenes were pretty impressive. There are many fan movies that are a whole heck of a lot better. The new Padawan was someone that children could enjoy watching and identify with. As a spin off from the Star Wars franchise it's OK at best, as a kids film there's much better, as a pilot episode to the upcoming cartoon series it's watchable and if compared to a direct to DVD Disney sequel, it's decent. Finally, a good word about it, scenes that didn't have any characters in them, for example space and' landscape' scenes did look particularly good and demonstrate the potential for how enjoyable the film COULD have been."
7608,"2/10 It's the middle point of the film where things take a substantial and wonderful turn. The last two instalments of the film are really, really good. KC Collins leads the threesome of actors and is top notch. The guy is eccentric, with shaved pubes, and dresses in hip - hop clothes. A home invasion scene between two ex-lovers is suspenseful, and in a dark way, kinda funny."
6734,"It takes balls to leave in a scene discussing how Blue - Ray conquered HD - DVD (and expect anyone to fine it funny). Rude, witty, and ballsy, TROPIC THUNDER is a great time at the movies. Of course they do it all with that post-modernist, deconstuctionist, ironic flavour, but, unlike their forebears - Bob Hope, Jack Benny, Jack Lemmon - they are neither funny nor particularly attractive as characters! The production value and effects make this seem as though it is a certified blockbuster falling apart at the seams. Jack Black's Jeff Portney reins in his comedian schtick to portray a hardened solider, voice rasping as he shows his serious side; Stiller's Tugg Speedman attempts to revive the action cred he tried to leave behind with his Oscar - bait turn as a mentally handicapped man in Simple Jack, where he went "" full retarded, no one ever comes back from that ""; and Robert Downey Jr.'s Kirk Lazarus, Australian genius at his craft, playing a black man like he was born one."
6723,"At a time of many excellent documentaries, this one seems indispensable. "" His was a pure act, an existential declaration of joy, an example of how to live life daily to the fullest . "" The images, not just of the central feat, but of many of Philippe Petit's performances are arresting and jaw - droppingly beautiful. The miniature mock - ups of the top of the towers (handsome, and in wood). It is hard to put into words just how good this film is, and on just how many levels it works."
6732,""" Elegy "" has some seriously good, sure footed performances. Ben Kingsley gives one of his best performances. It offers up some food for thought and it's artfully created while Kingsley, Cruz, and Hopper each supply fantastic performances. But the emotions can hold some value if well addressed. The Spanish Isabel Coixet is certainly one of the most sensitive directors of the cinema industry."
6730,"Overall, this is a big budget production, and it does show in the lavish sets, costumes, impressive battle mobilization, etc. . 3) Zhuge Lian and Zhou Yu are way above the rest in intellect and that they can communicate on a higher plain. Also the storytelling is great and full of excellent metaphors, the characters got depths and smarts. This scene was able to establish Zhuge's brilliance and it stayed central to the film's goal (war strategy). The battle scenes were visually stimulating enough, and are the best parts of the movie, so savour them!"
6689,"What is almost fascinating about Zohan is how little interest the screen - writers have in their own story. It worked with his initial efforts, Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore. So, knowing what you are getting into is important but, once there, what does Zohan do for the casual viewer - ie not the audience member who puts Sandler as #1 on the list of all time comedians but rather someone who sees him as, at best, a man who can turn his juvenile comedy into a guilty pleasure. But if you aren't easily offended and are a fan of Adam Sandler's work, then you'll have fun with the silky smooth goodness that Zohan brings to the table. Zohan looks like it will be a daring and imaginative comedy but, beyond the basic design of the film the material is pretty much what you would expect from an Adam Sandler film in so much as it is crude, silly and aimed at a teenage market."
6617,"10 , 000BC is the cafeteria lasagna. It's a great Saturday matinÃ©e. There is a key ingredient missing in 10 , 000 B. C., and that is fun. The heroes are an unnamed tribal people who speak perfect English, all have the bodies of supermodels, and hunt mammoths for food. The producers make some nice gestures toward Ice Age realism with their portrayal of the encampment of the mammoth hunters, who have cool dreadlocks (like most folks in prehistoric movies nowadays), cool face paint, fancy bone weapons & jewelry, and appropriately furry garments."
6729,"One of the best comedies in years. Aside from that moment the whole thing works beautifully, quite astounding given the mesh of many different genres and sorts of comedy that this is. It's one of the funniest movies of the decade, and one of the best theater experiences of this year. There were so many laugh out loud scenes and the interaction between the characters was pure gold. Another very strong thing about this movie is that it never drags, and is almost a complete opposite of Superbad."
6978,"is solid and the music from Fernando Velazquez sounds like the classics. 0'), cinematography of Josep M. Civit (' Guerreros'), and the production design of Pilar Revuelta (' Pan's Labyrinth'),' Shiver' is presented as a strikingly attractive film with some extremely beautiful and well captured settings. but the real gem is "" Shiver "", available on DVD. With such instant classics as' The Orphanage ,' ' Rec ,' and' Pan's Labyrinth' (questionably horror, still, but impossible to not mention), Spain has aided in giving some much - needed relief from the seemingly unending stretch of Hollywood unoriginality. The first half of the film builds up the case for Santi's involvement in mysterious murders and hints at supernatural elements--parallels with vampires and werewolves."
6843,"this film surely merits the two stars. And what good actors, Live Schreiber as Zus, what a performance, also Daniel Craig faultless as Tuvia. Not Zwick's best effort though and as for the acting it was Liev Schreiber that delivered the most. That is when you need a good leader which the Bielski brothers certainly were. Zwick has created one of the most beautiful and thought provoking films of his career and definitely one of the most Oscar worthy movies to hit cinemas in years."
7240,"But it doesn't hold back the believability aspects and retains it's dark side pretty well. It was great to see a change of scenery in 24, from L. A. to Africa. The cast are reasonable enough, all fitting into the classic clichÃ©s of the show. If you loved the first few seasons, you will love this! The film is exiting, gripping, it uses every one of its minutes effectively, and it is much more plausible with its plot and Jack's relations and intentions."
7347,"While some might enjoy it less then CC1, it's still good. Raw, authentic, dramatic, slightly comedic, and definitely a movie appealing to viewers of several different genres. The fast - paced documentary is directed by Bill Corben (Raw Deal) and edited by David Cypkin. A lot of real life Scarface stories. With CC2 Corben does an excellent job of grabbing the audience by the throat and never letting them go."
7309,"There are a few twists along the way, and the final scene is very well - done, and will stay with you for a long time. It has enough twists, turns and enough surprises / scares to keep anyone's attention. The scenes in between the supernatural images and occurrences focus on how each family member (and some friends) deal with all that happens, and it is done in a refreshingly realistic (not over-blown, sentimental, or dramatic) way. Anyway, its a good movie if you like slow movies, and good scares. The downplayed, monotone performances of the actors is very effective."
6620,"The Whos are intelligent little creatures who are strange in appearance. Though microscopic, the world known as Whoville is a land of technological achievement. Again, this is a great film for all ages. represents a step up for Blue Sky Studios, who has played supporting roles to Pixar and Dreamworks. Steve Carell also did an amazing job as the Mayor of Whoville."
7247,"It's a piece of violent irony, humor, satire, craziness, pointlessness and yet so right to the point. , a certain complexness and a humor that's just so. It has an interesting storyline and is hilarious, just like the South Park series is! South Park's Imaginationland was originally a three - parter episode. It also has plenty of interesting characters."
6619,"If you're a fan of action, horror, and the 1980s, this is the film to watch. what it is - a tongue in cheek splatter fest homage to the great John Carpenter movies of the 80s and with a bunch of mad max thrown in. It's pretty reminiscent of Grindhouse: Planet Terror, so if you enjoyed that modern cult classic, you could get some kicks out of this one too. Added bonus is the great music choices which just add to the fun - "" Good Tning "" by FYC when the main lunatic introduces himself to the crowd and "" Two Tribes "" by Frankie Goes To Hollywood for the big car chase. Marshall has skillfully engineered what is truly an homage to the genre movie and an action buffet for moviegoers with appropriate kitsch and over-the-topness without lowering himself to the realm of spoof."
6684,"The performances were excellent, particularly by Kevin Spacey. This is a fascinating look at the mess in FL in 2000, and goes through everything that happened step by step. The dialog and performances were so natural, it was almost like a documentary. The major players in this high - stakes drama are all here too, and documentary footage is inserted for believability. Laura Dern, as Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris, creates a memorable character and Tom Wilkinson is a standout as Bush's legal adviser James Baker (Secratary of State under George H. W. Bush)."
6693,"It is enjoyable and fits nicely into the apocalyptic genre but' Signs' has done this sort of idea before and did it better. Shyamalan, who was using close - ups and steadicam shots to frankly brilliant effect early on, begins to use the same shots to comical effect. Normally well - written, taut and engaging screenplays, like good editing should be invisible. Besides being amazingly, ridiculously gorgeous she is a fine actress and creates a sympathetic character (and a fairly well - drawn one at that - one of the few pros in Shyamalan's script). Nor will the overuse of incredible special effects, slashing and squirting blood and gore, erotic sex scenes, fast paced chases, or crude language."
7263,"Thank goodness it fell into the safe hands of Anthony Minghella. The production quality was very good with the Botswanian Tourist Board probably very happy at the positive light their country is portrayed under. The No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is a delightful and memorable watch. Minghella has successfully created a TV film version of the much loved novel of the same name by Alexander McCall Smith. The gentle pacing and episodic construction means that it isn't exactly edge - of - your seat stuff; but its also fresh, diverting and oddly believable - and as such, a final feather in Minghella's cap."
6695,"Ranks up there with the absolute best they have produced. "" WALL Â· E "" operates on two levels (and works spectacularly well on both). clean lines, crisp colors, and very "" virtual "", for lack of a better term. At times, especially with that perspective on the humans, they actually do look very real. Coming with high expectations, it definitely succeeded mines."
6618,"The performances are surprisingly well rounded, Statham doing a brilliant job and the majority of the supporting cast getting some great scenes. It builds up the plot lines and tries somewhat successfully to tie everything together. Instead, everything is under - played, the characters are superbly realistic and believable, and the script sharp as a pin. Still she does have some great moments in the earlier part of the film. Worth many repeated viewings for the subtle humour and to get the most out of the twisting plot developements."
6819,"They rise, and empower others to rise, to be the best that they can be. Riveting, moving, without concessions and Benicio del Toro is just extraordinary. Designed for flexibility and functionality, the package weighs a mere 9 lbs. As consolation the star, Benicio Del Toro, got the Best Actor award there. Benicio Del Toro, one of the film's producers, gives a champion's performance, not least because it's modest."
6680,"The recent VACANCY and FUNNY GAMES are leaps and bounds greater than this film. Both Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman do well in their leading roles, and the strangers themselves are things of pure terror. Scott Speedman also does an excellent and believable job. They appear and disappear seemingly at will and instantly - a power the young couple probably wished they had but don't because they are, after all, HUMANS. There is plenty here to recommend: Director Bryan Bertino shows himself to be a patient and smart director."
6679,"The male cast are mainly just narrative devices and, with the exception of Eigenberg and possibly Noth. The characters are older now and, after the series ended, all partnered up to a certain degree and "" happy "" in their relationships. She is a huge fan of the show, has every season on DVD, and has seen all the episodes multiple times. There were very very few lines that gave a glimpse of the old clever dialog, and they all got lost in a mass of cheesy lines about love and friendship that you even rarely anymore encounter in the corniest of Hollywood's chick flicks, and toiler humor that you only expect from movies like Harold and Kumar."
6836,""" Bedtime Stories "" is a family entertainment from the Disney Studios surprisingly good. Sandler rules: This is one of the best children / adult stories this year, an ironic twist on romantic and heroic tales told from children's point of view through the masterful child / adult lens of an underplaying, child - friendly master. It actually can be enjoyed by all ages in the family. On the down side, some of the best moments were captured in the previews. Bedtime Stories has it's occasional laughs, but it seems like this was more made for a 4 year old."
6837,"The story is quite liberally changed in some instances, but in others, it is an almost literal recreation. On one hand, the laughs managed to stay more or less consistent, with none of the jokes falling flat. Mancini is a well - rounded character, with bizarrely comic traits that are pure Palahniuk. Palahniuk's touch even translated perfectly in David Fincher's adaptation. First - timer Gregg manages to handle his duties (which include writing, directing and even one very amusing bit part) with confidence, balancing comedy with drama effectively."
6838,"The lighting, colors, sets, scenes, costumes, everything is extremely well done. What a brilliant achievement for Mendes / Winslet / Dicaprio and the rest of the cast. The cinematography is amazing, as well as the costumes and the whole set designs. DiCaprio and Winslet give powerhouse performances. Leo DiCaprio uses his expressive face to brilliant effect as Frank."
6841,"Please support Academy caliber documentaries, with a strong sense of heart, and a great message of hope. You hold onto their love and hope through the last few minutes, and eventually you find what the narrator finds: inspiration. Instead, while it has some wrenching moments, it's ultimately a love story of family and friends, and the powerful influence people can have in each others lives, for good and for ill. Oh, there is a special place reserved in heaven for all the Bagbys. With such a tough, emotional subject, it would be easy to get overtly sentimental, but Kuenne does a terrific job."
6991,"It's out to please crowds. Might is right and possession is none tenths of the law. This film should be judged on its accomplishments taking into account the restrictions, and it does very well. Jerusalema is, taken in context, an excellent film with plenty of local content and in - jokes. If you thought Tsotsi was brilliant, Jerusalema will blow you away."
6704,"Consequently, it brings with it the energy and intensity that was pervasive in those times and places, like San Francisco in the early 60s. Here, Gibney takes on the fascinating story of Hunter S. Thompson. There is an immense wealth of spinoffs on film; Gibney had rich, rich material to work with here. One of Thompson's famous quotes gives a hint of the link: "" America. The best that could happen is that this beautifully edited and greatly entertaining film makes a host of new converts to the writing."
6638,"The upbeat, piano - heavy tunes are a definite highlight and truly work well to accent the lighthearted atmosphere. Overall, Leatherheads is worth it for the entertainment value. It offers excellent sets, costumes and characterizations typical of the Roaring 20's when Newspapers were godlike, and Radio was just unfolding. There are also some absolutely classic lines and scenes. Randy Newman's swinging score is jazzy and jaunty, adding light excitement and highlights the screwiest scenes."
6994,"The Deal was a few cameos short of brilliant and a bit light on the darker sides. But he's learned enough tricks, and developed enough chutzpah that with a little luck he can really work the system. This is of course not surprising since the film is hugely fun, mixing Judaism / Israeli aspects into a wonderful satire of Hollywood filmdom. The plot has got twists enough to keep you hooked and amusing bits to keep you chuckling. BTW, Macy and Ryan are listed way down the cast totem pole in the credits, but they are the main star vehicles that drive this film and keep it moving."
6842,"The plot is realistic and yet dramatic enough to keep viewers interested. This film has more of an edge than your usual teen flick and will definitely appeal to a wider range of ages. The friendships that Poppy created are well portrayed and told. The cast doe an excellent job, with the teens carrying the movie pretty much themselves. Some of it #s content makes it quite a predictable teen movie but despite this the film is good fun and has some surprise moments."
6670,"As for a few cameo appearances you should also look out for, the performances are remarkable. The Art Direction and the locations are astounding, very vibrant and unlike anything you would have ever seen in film. The effects are absolutely top notch, and in the final third the movie reaches such a fever pitch of excitement that it recalls Peter Jackson's "" The Two Towers, "" arguably the most exciting installment of the "" Lord of the Rings "" trilogy. The battle scenes are brilliant, as are the landscapes. The film in itself is often reminiscent of LOTR, but the major difference being in a childlike simplicity this one retains."
6997,"Zooey Deschanel is nothing short of excellent. Wes Anderson and Jason Reitman and Judd Apatow are practitioners of this dynamic. Someone who doesn't just dip a toe, but who jumps back and forth fearlessly carrying back insight. The performances are top - notch and completely appropriate for the tone that director Aselton is trying to create. Aselton's debut is a fun and absorbing watch and it lingers in mind long after the end credits have rolled."
6844,"Equally compelling is the character Jennifer Grogan (Jennifer Aniston). Jennifer Aniston was great too, she really delivered. Jennifer Aniston really does the best job in the picture. Yes, the main character is Marley, but Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson are great in their roles. Children - three, ultimately - come into their lives and John's (Wilson) career continues to advance as he carves a niche as a local columnist."
6845,"For this, Miyasaki is a true master of There is a cuteness factor in this film rivaling and arguably surpassing that of Tonari no Totoro. In many ways, Ponyo is very reminiscent of Mei in Totoro. Joe Hisaishi, once again, provided outstanding musical support. This film is of course for children, but (yes, as with Totoro) its merit lies in its many delights â€“ the lovingly precise portrayal of children's behaviour, the many moments of wonder and the sheer artistic vision."
6637,"And the fine performances and polished visuals enhance the overall look and feel, to create a film that is both engaging and entertaining. There are lots of elaborate camera dissolves and close - ups. He does a great job with the mannerisms to give you a real sense of the character's evolution. The film features nice performances from actors Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburne, as well as nice entries from the lesser known ensemble. 21 is definitely the major film for the spring time, it has young hot actors, including an incredible academy award winner, Kevin Spacey, and another great actor who's head looks like it grew quite a bit bigger, Lawarence Fishburne."
7127,"The story is sentimental and tragic and it is tied together quite nicely by the three lead players who all play off of each other very well and convincingly (Duff is flighty, Scott Thomas is concerned and Johnson is a free soul). The story is beautifully handled from beginning to end and the acting from the three main leads is superb. Aaron Johnsons does a very good interpretation of his character John Lennon and reveals the mischievous antics of the teen aged John Lennon and the constant internal battle Lennon fought inside of himself to find out who he was. The integrity that Wood and Greenhlgh produce with this style of filming allows the acting performances to flourish and creates the lost persona of the John Lennon, to be fully exemplified. In his teens, which is when the film properly begins, he goes on to pinball between the two very different women, the stoic Mimi (a surprisingly well - cast Kristin Scott Thomas, transplanting that glorious sang - froid to Liverpool) and the flighty, possibly manic - depressive Julia (Anne Marie Duff, also excellent)."
6718,"But, naturally, not everything is perfect. Snyder staged some truly impressive dramatic scenes. Overall, it is a satisfying film experience for someone familiar with the source material. All this is further complimented by the good choices in costumes. The attention to detail in even the smallest scenes is commendable and the dense flashback structure means the same attention is paid to the presentation of full and complex characters."
6873,"Like the soundtrack to its predecessor, it was produced by hip - hop producer The RZA (also co-founder of the Wu - Tang Clan). "" Afro Samurai: Resurrection "" has finally landed on DVD! Most importantly, it's a sequel that's on equal grounds with its predecessor; a few marks in terms of storytelling and characterization keep this second entry from being superior. Whereas the first worked so well exactly because of the very simple revenge story - Afro, wearing the Number Two headband, looking for the man who killed his father, all the while having to defend his headband from an assortment of colourful villains, not very different to a video game logic and very enjoyable for that matter - Afro Samurai: Resurrection throws everything and the kitchen sink in the plot and hopes it all makes sense somehow. The refreshing and intriguing combination of blaxploitation, samurai culture, anime and hip hop (soundtrack by usual suspect RZA) that made the first one such an infectiously cool hack - and - slash yarn is pretty much of the same standards but this time it's let down by a silly story and disappointing ending that was clearly not very well thought out."
7070,"He's so likable and well - paced that you just can't believe it either, and can't imagine anything getting any better for him - until he goes off in a blaze of glory. Apparently Hess noticed him long before that, and was able to capitalize on Angarano's rising talent, to have it perfectly coincide with Gentlemen Broncos. It was full of laugh - out - loud scenes, with comedy on every level, excellent performances, and a sneaky plot that Scorsese would have been proud of. But to watch Angarano hang ten on his own terms, through his own scenes, was magnificent. But the real satisfaction ends up coming from Hess knowing to place Michael Angarano right up front to show everyone what he can do."
6852,"Well, it looks like their dream is finally coming true as their boyfriends have popped the question and now all that's left to do is book the venue. Now the movie does have some good laughs here and there, but they're mostly shown in the trailer. At this point, the real silliness kicks in: diet sabotage, tans gone awry and the occasional witty remark, like "" Your wedding's gonna be huge, just like your ass at prom "". Emma and Liv are best friends who have planned every detail of their weddings since they first witnessed a wedding at the Plaza Hotel. Perhaps the only scene for men to enjoy is the bachelorette party - you'll see - ;) Hathaway looks smokin' hot."
6853,"And the 3D was a nice treat. The locations above ground were more lush and not as economically depressed as they looked in the original. "" Friday the 13th "" was the best as far as that scenario goes. It delivers buckets of gore, brisk pacing, and a lot of in your face 3D goodness. Things that go bump in the night, shadows in windows, someone watching you and you have no idea they are there, and the best part."
6857,""" Rise of the Lycans "", on the surface, makes a perfectly well working prequel. Very effective in this type of movies. This amazing movie displays noisy action, thrills ride, stirring fighting, graphic violence, brief nudism with mild sex scene and is pretty amusing. OVERALL: Underworld: Rise of the Lycans is a great movie to catch. This original and gore - soaked vampires film begins centuries ago."
6859,"His Paul Blart is admirable in a way. Rest assured, it's a fun comedy with many funny gags / bits. If anything, it's one step closer to making James the cross-over star he obviously wants to be. They go to good lengths to show how truly depressing his life is. A film which should be quietly enjoyable and give a few laughs."
6862,"There are lots of other more interesting and actually scary movies out there. The performances are able enough with the likes of Matthew Knight, Emi Ikehata, Johanna Braddy, Jadie Hobson and Shawnee Smith. Artistic and suspenseful cinematography have been replaced by bland, formulaic and frightfully comical scenes. All of the wonderful aspects of the original film which gave it an incredibly tense atmosphere and a realistic sense of dread are totally absent here."
6864,"When the sound and lighting are as controlled as in Coraline the Director can really impress upon the viewer a believable world that you can see yourself involved. However, the creative imagination of Coraline takes a spin and makes a very unbelievable situation seem plausible. The style is stunning and the story is an unwavering fairy - tale nightmare that has some genuinely scary moments. To Selick's credit this is the first 3D stop motion ever made; stereoscopic 3D. The Movie Coraline is an animated film well worth watching more than once."
6866,"It has a bit of everything that is to be desired in a good movie. It has a lot of fantastic colors and utilizes lighting very well, it's set in very beautiful environments, and there are a lot of other great cinematic techniques being used. The actions scenes were great as well. Switches between the gritty and crisp, colorful filming worked well in bringing a certain mood to the appropriate scenes (which also looks brilliant on BluRay). Camilla Belle is gorgeous, and Djimon Hounsou is as intimidating as ever as the primary villain."
6867,"The revolving door of supporting players is top notch as it goes through the requisite motions. Other than that, everything else was top notch. And there is a Tykwer twist now and then, a camera with unusual fluidity, or a scene that gets replayed and rethought. All transmitted through the keen eyes of Tykwer, "" The International "" crackles with tension and arrives on the world scene as a refreshingly old - fashioned suspense thriller in a post-modern milieu. The International provides a breath of fresh air to fans of thrillers."
6869,"The acting is all pretty faultless, with Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Connelly, Brendan Cooper and Justing Long displaying some of their best work. Sure there is X likes Y but Y likes Z but Z is married to A. Which is always entertaining. Some of the lines are priceless, and a couple of the funniest scenes in the movie involve "" street interviews "" Ã  la Sex and the City Season 1. What epiphany did the Justin Long character undergo to realize that he was really "" into "" the Ginnifer Goodwin character? The film of course has a number of elements and outcomes that are extremely predictable (it IS a romantic comedy) but there's enough other stuff in there, and definite surprises at the end, to make it more than just the sum of its parts."
6871,"Though Bender's big score was a watchable piece the latest two movies were a bore. Into the Wild Green Yonder is a brilliant animation film, which may not be at the same level of the series, but which deserves a very enthusiastic recommendation. While "" Into the Wild Green Yonder "" isn't the strongest of the four films, it certainly offers up laughs and plenty of the clever, over the top sci - fi concepts that the series is famous for. It's like The Simpsons, but without the overwhelming charm and fantastic characters. If you like Futurama you'll likely enjoy this, otherwise hop skip and jump over it."
6875,"This revelation rocks George's life. Consensus: Expect a fascinating drama with fine acting and a few hearty laughs (if you can handle crude humor). Judd Apatow has improved tremendously with each movie he's directed, and, despite his detractors, he's going to be the king of the comedy movie for a long, long time. After all, the film stars Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen (who have wonderful rapport), among many other, uh, funny people, and is written and directed by Judd Apatow, the director of "" The 40 - Year - Old Virgin "" and "" Knocked Up . "" Anyone who has enjoyed Apatow's work as a director knows that his films have become incrementally longer."
6877,"But it keeps its momentum WITH these bits, and is all - the - better because of it. The film, of course, was the most impressive aspects - both surprising, (minimally) disappointing, and inspiring in the way it played out. This movie is a comedy, and for what comedies do, it was spot on. That speaks to the talent of creative minds behind the project. A perfect mix of bizarre twists and turns, outlandish situations, and keeping on track with the story to be told."
6878,"Some of these scenes question American class division and have a purpose. When the movie started it was great with Madea, her story, and how she got to where she is now. The moments were funny, but as a movie to make the big screen; let's just say this would have been better if it were a special on t. v. and free."
6879,"Sounds good, you say, then why only five stars out of ten? in the end, this movie doesn't offer any solutions to life's quirks, but it looks at them and even celebrates them. In fact, although Mendes is still wonderful at showing the idiosyncrasies and flaws in the lives of average Americans, this film's sweetness is its core asset. As for John Krasinski, he was very good too as the loving, supportive boyfriend. Allison Janney is the funniest of the broad, playing Verona's former boss Lily, an abrasive alcoholic who enjoys point - blank degrading her children and her crazy, paranoid husband, nicely played by Jim Gaffigan."
6883,"He has faced some pretty amazing obstacles, and he has stood in some pretty big shadows. Still, there is enough here for viewers to laugh at and enjoy, exerting the right to relax. Nicole is very beautiful and so is Sonia, who has a sexier look and, for a while, eyes for Clouseau. A great part of the charm of the Pink Panther movies was derived from the exclusively sixties flavour, the vehicles, the fashion and above all the actors who were extraordinarily well cast. Joining Steve Martin (Clouseau) are some accomplished actors: Andy Garcia plays (very well) Italian businessman Vicenzo, Alfred Molina is British inspector Pepperidge, and Yuki Matsuzaki is Japanese electronics expert Kenji."
6887,"The best thing about this movie is that everything unfolds naturally. There's additional excellent work from J. K. Simmons, Jamie Pressly, Sarah Burns and Rob Huebel, among others. Jason Segel was perfectly cast also, he managed to get some good laughs. Paul Rudd is great, always, he had better chemistry with Rashida Jones and Jason Segel, then he had with Elizabeth Banks and Seann William Scott. Rather, Segel shows in this movie that he's good at playing a different kind of ambitious person."
6888,"On the plus side, Roberts and Owen provide two extremely watchable lead characters and are ably supported by Wilkinson and the always good Giamatti. "" Dark Knight "" composer James Newton Howard's orchestral score infuses "" Duplicity "" more energy than anything Roberts and Owen pull off as a pair. A few years ago both Clive and Julia did a movie together called "" Closer "", and it was satisfying to see them back together again. Sure, Owens is swift and good, but Roberts looks fresh off the' Ocean' s' set, with almost zero charisma she was built on in the early 90s. After roughly three - dozen "" two weeks ago, "" "" ten years ago, "" etc, flashbacks, you'll learn Roberts and Owen are capers in love attempting to make a heist (and life) together using their trained skills."
6889,"She is prevented from finishing her image, which is actually a series of seemingly random numbers, and goes missing during the ceremony. Caleb watching a video of his mother singing him a lullaby is a really strong little character moment in the midst of everything else going on. Then everything went left and the movie bounded over the shark as Cage begins a wild chase to tell everyone about the end of the world. The good: Strong start to the movie, the plot hooks you in, excellent sound, confronting disaster scenes, haunting images, Rose Byrne, at times quite freaky, The Bad: Special effects looked like they were from a video game, ripped off basically every science fiction movie ever made, poor acting from Nic Cage, very predictable. A fascinating discovery, but more important matters lie hidden in the numbers, as there are three dates and three major disasters to come."
6891,"But as a piece of cinema, completely removed from its literary origins, it definitely leaves an impression! "" MÃ¤n som hatar kvinnor "" is an ambitious project. Camera work and the overall look of the film is astounding, especially on bluray. Key scenes from the book are flawlessly executed and the characters are captured very convincingly. The principal characterizations are quite well suited by the cast who fit naturally in the roles they play with great realism."
6894,"It may look like it is a direct - to - DVD movie but it is a lot better than some direct - to - DVD movies. Recognizable names such as Burns, Rhames, Sheen and even Jonathan Pryce lend some gravitas into a slightly - above average thriller, which if you put aside the implausibles, actually is of some fun. He's hounded by an FBI agent (VING RHAMES), an ex-agent (ED BURNS) and a powerful U. S. govt minister (MARTIN SHEEN). Throw in some Russians, a shadowy romantic interest (TAMARA FELDMAN), some fine car chases, intrusive cameras everywhere, and you've got an interesting and fun ride. One of the two credited writers (and, as usual in movies, there may be more writers involved) must have been the one to dump a whole bucket of stupid over this script."
6895,"What IS great is the 3D. The visuals are very nicely done - the backgrounds, characters and scope of detail are great. The artwork and colors are magnificent. Still - make sure you see it in 3D! Chances are you'll find this movie a lot better than you thought."
8618,"the credible chain of gestures and dialogs. a wise film, far of usual traps, clear and grave, profound and clear as a water glass. An example will be like how Heneveld got ordered to have a moustache. Gene Bervoets, Annet Malherbe, who is seen as Bella and is the director's wife, Gijs Naber and Mr. Van Warmerdam contribute to the success of this film. Photographed by Tom Erisman, the remoteness of the Dutch countryside shines in a contrast of sunny and somber shades."
6958,"At the same time, Home finishes in a upbeat manner. First of all, the visuals (e. g. photography) are stunning and very beautiful. Some of the scenes are absolutely SURREAL in their beauty. The vast amounts of wealth owned by 2% of the population. Wonderful scenes, really beautiful pictures of Earth."
6900,"Plus, he's a major a-hole, to boot. He's a hero in his own mind and his own territory, and Rogen is more acutely committed to this performance than any before, leaping in with profundity and brooding. Despite that, there are also scenes that are moving and true to life which make this more than just some exercise in shoddy exploitation. The grandest indication that Rogen and Hill have scored something above average is when the authentic jolt and utter hilarity of a peak moment of violence reveals the stunner that everything had led up to that moment within reason, if only in Ronnie's line of reasoning. The supporting cast are also equally brilliant, especially his mother and Seth's co-workers."
6901,"The '80s was the decade where coming - of - age dramedies blossomed with great soundtracks, and Adventureland pays off in that regard as well. James is a virgin, true, a 22 year old one at that, but that has far more to do with the character's tentative nature than any' quest' to get laid (ala "" The 40 Year Old Virgin "", which works on its own terms of course, but is again nothing like "" Adventureland ""), and he is far from bad looking. What makes the movie even more appealing is that it not only doesn't treat its characters as generic stereotypes, but as humans, which makes them more appealing to the audience. The simple beauty of James, Em, and Joel watching fireworks on the 4th of July or a marijuana - fueled bumper car round scored to "" Just Like Heaven "" by The Cure. This is very, very far removed from the slob - meets - babe formula common in comedies in recent years."
6902,"No moments of cringe worthy awfulness, and some good cast chemistry. He's amused by Becky's antics and impressed by her candor. It seems like everything's going swell with her new job and a surprise romance with Luke. Rebecca Bloomwood is a lovely redheaded young woman who loooooves to shop. There's a truckload of "" aww "" uttering romance, "" lol "" comedy and it's great for all ages."
6903,"Unlike its predecessors, the most surprising thing about "" Revelation "" is that it actually has a story and fully - realized characters. Although spotty, Carnack manages to pump out a few scenes that reach an authentic emotional quality. Some very nice moments in the film are undercut with overlong scenes and sloppy editing. Miner's performance nails a character really well and when she's on screen the movie really comes to life. Like the previous movies, he has the ability to travel back in time to key moments to gain some new information and sometimes even alter the past."
6904,"The location of Master Roshi's house is totally mismatch to the surrounding backdrop. One of the marketing factor of Dragonball is the fighting style and its creative art of fighting sequence. For manga and anime fans around the world, the story of Dragonball has to be at the top, or at least in the top 3 of their most beloved manga / anime stories ever written. Emmy Rossum was great in The Day After Tomorrow but not in this movie. It's the original storyline that made fans love Dragonball in the first place."
6905,"Michelle Rodrequez, Jordana Brewster, Gal Gabot, and Liza Lapira are hot! With his gravelly voice, bulging biceps, and cool, playful way around a line of dialogue, he's a lot of fun to watch. Gal Gadot is tremendous as Gisele Harabo it was her first role in this film and she was awesome, she acted the character terrific. He's fantastic with these action sequences, not only making them pulse - pounding thrill rides but also letting you feel like you're in the car with these characters. Just after four movies it's all gotten stale and it's easy to see that the cars are the real stars here."
6907,"Armando Iannucci, most known for his The Thick of It series in the UK, directs a movie with the a the familiar theme of The Office. Ms. Chlumsky is now a mature presence and should definitely be a consistent actress for years to come. James Gandolfini and Mimi Kennedy each give strong performances, and Chris Addison, Anna Chlumsky (its good to see her back by the way), and the rest of the cast do nice work as well. This is a fantastic film that never lets up on the laughs or one - liners. Loop stars Peter Capaldi, Gina McKee, James Gandolfini, Chris Addison and there's even a whimsical cameo by Steve Coogan."
6908,"And it's partying in the true 60s sense of the word. But these faults are more than made up for in the performances; all of which are good - and some are outstanding. The gags are good, even when they tank. Sure enough the tracks were well chosen in general, even though only snatches were heard of some. It does get overweight by a looong script, but the soundtrack and the cast are good enough to carry it through."
6910,"and even the smaller roles were really great additions. Zac Efron did a really decent acting job. It's probably because this film went that little bit further than most and took itself seriously, if only for parts of the movie. Quite moving and Mark is a much more 3 dimensional, well developed character than most PG - 13 rated movies you see. In 1989, Michael O'Donnell was a star athlete with a full college scholarship imminent."
6911,"He is the living proof of what a great caster Tarrantino is. The only role and the only gleam of hope for the entire movie is Chritoph Waltz who is building a truly deep and very detailed character here. "" The ONLY good thing in this movie was the performance of Mr. Waltz "". It is neither allegory nor satire, the two finest categories in both fiction and cinema, and yet it approaches perfection anyway. The opening scene with Denis Menochet as farmer and Christoph Waltz as SS officer is best part of the movie."
6912,"Crowe's and McAdams' characters brilliantly investigate a deadly situation tainted with national intrigue that includes the young yet powerfully influential Stephen Collins played by Ben Affleck. Even as new characters and twists keep coming, the audience is never left out in the cold. A powerhouse cast, that doesn't disappoint: Russell Crowe, Ben Affleck, Helen Mirren, Rachel McAdams, Robin Wright Penn, Jason Bateman, and Jeff Daniels McAdams, all but a ghost recently, holds her own against the two heavy - hitters and delivers a performance that is both inspired and emotional. This can also be contributed to the direction of Kevin MacDonald who, after winning an Oscar for his documentary One Day in September in 1999 and directing the Oscar - winning feature film The Last King of Scotland, proves that he has loads of talent and hopefully, will remain prominent in the film - making industry."
7622,"This is kind of a "" buddy "" vampire movie and there is some great interaction between the two main "" buddy "" characters. It deserves to become a cult classic (in the best sense of the phrase) though as it's a very intelligently written new take on the zombie genre, something with a lot of genuinely fascinating ideas which are explored beautifully. Yes, it is a buddy movie; yes, one of the buddies is undead; and yes, there is sarcastic dialogue and gun - play - but those just building blocks to what is, as a whole, a fantastic and sincere film which doesn't let itself get stuck in a box. Anders & Wylde work brilliantly together & D. Kerry Prior's script is a great new take on the zombie genre which other film makers should take note of. Watching The Revenant, he's definitely not just a special effects artist taking a stab at directing; this is a film handled was great confidence and ability, marking a start to what will hopefully be a prosperous career."
6913,"Clough was one heck of a character and very much of his time and this is where' The Damned United' really succeeds. Clough had his demons and was a complicated man. It is no joke that other countries around the world take their soccer seriously. Don Revie was a great man who took Leeds from the old Second Division to two First Division championships and two European trophies. He was essentially a dictator, and not always a benevolent one, often punching or slapping his players."
6914,"Because someone (from the first movie) really wants to personally see him suffer and die. Here's how funny it is: SpikeTV showed it and of course had to make countless cuts: not just the copious female nudity but the language and graphic violence and so on. Writers / Directors Neveldine / Taylor also step the visuals up a notch. Over-the-top and very funny is Ling Bai as Ria, chasing after "" her man "" Chelios. Dark Chocolate's elaborate eye - roll sequence is one for the ages and is worth the price of admission all by itself."
7040,"Some of the songs are genuinely enjoyable. Now it's not all bad, in fact the acting is quite entertaining and good, especially Tom Papa as Superbeasto, he's so over the top it's hilarious. The voice talents of Tom Kenny, Tom Papa and Paul Giamatti are amazing. Even though these characters are gruesome in the live action movies, there played with quite entertaining delight and goofiness in this movie. There was the occasional funny moment here and there, but the excessive use of spoofs (his own films and MANY others) was way overboard."
6915,"Sam Rockwell puts on a spellbinding performance and Kevin Spacey's GERTY voice - over is eery and excellent. He isn't entirely alone, because the AI computer GERTY (Kevin Spacey) is constantly following him. An excellent debut directorial by Duncan Jones, and clearly one of the 5 best sci - fi movies made in the last 10 years. Sam Bell (Rockwell) is the latest to undertake this task, with the trusted robot GERTY by his side watching over the base's operations--think HAL with a heart. Sam Rockwell gets to do a virtuoso turn as alternative versions of himself (his character's name is Sam too, Sam Bell)."
6916,"Both Jackman and Collins shine in these scenes. A lot of cool stunts and daring moves. Wolverine has some breathtaking action scenes. As well as leading directly into the beginning of the X-Men with the "" calling "" of Scott Summers. But even with these changes, Deadpool was still an amazing character, well - done by Ryan Reynolds."
8580,"Plan A is' make a great film that runs under 90 minutes'; PLAN B is' make a great film'. Pablo is worthy of being loved because he is intelligent & interesting, but humble, kind, without vanity--all those good things. Plan B is a captivating movie about feelings and the struggle to be honest, at least to yourself about them. However, during the course of this film, he becomes very beautiful through the eyes of his friend who reluctantly falls in love with him. Nicely acted by the two lead players, with a cast of (apparently) non-professional actors that makes things more believable."
6917,"The film looks great too, the cinematography is really modern, realistic and with intimate camera movements. Oh right, that kinda sorta did happen once from that porn star from the 80's Traci lords. Another noteworthy (relatively speaking) encounter is between her and some guy from L. A. with a wife and kids. Her relationship with her costumers and other professionals who are part of the escort world is built little by little in several out - of - order scenes. The only thing any of these characters ever spent any amount of time discussing with one another was the economic crisis and the presidential elections and that's it, quite literally."
7041,"Production values are naturally first rate, with a vivid color palette and in - your - face costumes that are occasionally (and appropriately) over the top. Page is fantastic in her role, perfectly capturing the rebellious, curious character of Bliss Cavendar. But despite the multitude of talented actors, Page clearly carries the film on her diminutive shoulders and is easily in control of the material. Ellen Page and Marcia Gay Harden are excellent and the mother / daughter scenes are very real. Unlike most "" rise to the top "" movies, Whip It is believable."
6918,"Even amidst all the doom and gloom of the movie there are some sublime moments of beauty, humanity and yes even hope. There are great shots of border crossings and always the trains. Willy and Sayra are an odd couple, but seem good for each other, though their destiny seems obvious from the first moment. Opening in Tapachula in the state of Chiapas in southern Mexico with a saturated color palette of deep red and orange, the trajectory of this low - budget, but beautifully shot thriller follows two parallel threads that meet in the middle. He plays hero to Paulina Gaitan's Sayra, who is on her way to see relatives in New Jersey."
8543,"The rest of the cast is very diverse and thats just brilliant and so refreshing. The songs were all original, and perfectly placed. Hes a wonderfully typical cute gay guy. Its got a good story line, original songs (in the vein of a good musical are at the appropriate times), it has an excellent diverse cast, Choreography for several of the songs which is spot on for the number, humor (especially perfect in a lesbian tennis scene)."
6919,"This is a must see film, even if you can't tell the difference between a Tribble and a Tholian! There are just enough seconds of great action in this film to fit into a great trailer. Not to just switch off their brains and enjoy the pretty explosions. There are just enough seconds truly funny comedy to fit into a comedy trailer. It's a good thing Old Ben Kenobi was there to give Kirk that fatherly advice earlier - no, wait, that was Captain Pike."
7641,"He continues to have a great imagination and, while his on - stage wildness has been toned down a little, it remains in his writing and his phrasing. So in terms of subjects he is on ground covered by many observational comedians but it is "" how "" he covers them that makes him very funny."
8542,"They do it better on QAF. Also there are happy endings all around. They do pay homage, and parody existing theatre pieces, and they do it well. And the actors are very honest in their approach. The choreography blends a lot of trademark routines from hit shows of the last 40 years."
6921,"It is unique, different from other war movies. etc) who were intelligent and were extremely skilled warriors. For the male audience, it is the childlike yet seriousness of Zhao Wei as Sun Shangxiang, and Lin Chi - ling's poise and compassion as Xiao Qiao that allures. In the original story, Cao Cao also brought with him his best generals (Xiahou Yuan, Zhang Liao, Xu Chu, Xu Huang, Zhang He. Furthermore, John Woo failed to portray Liu Bei as a powerful man who would rise to be the ruler of one of the three kingdoms."
6923,"Sound effects and sound tracks were very good. ( 9) In the novel, the character of Hassassin was an unforgettable villain. McKenna is branded; a few seconds later he is giving orders, and a few minutes later, he is running (literally) around in charge of operations--in real life, he would be in shock. You would think that with a running time of about 140 minutes a movie is able to bring more. The magnificent Bernini sculpture of the "" Ecstasy of St. Teresa "" was only momentarily glimpsed, and the West Ponente relief in Vatican Square was not visible at all."
6925,"So it's a movie which has its ups and downs. Plain and simple Fanboys was great. But it's enjoyable more often than not and the movie breezes by in a nice, tight, well - paced 90 minutes. Fortunately, for those fans, "" Fanboys "" is good. Most all of them agree though, that this movie provides some laughs, has decent acting, and is decently done."
7652,"While it is thin and bland too, it is brilliantly played out and executed in the sense that you actually care what's going on and what's going to happen to these characters. Prayers for Bobby was truly an amazing movie. Beyond the powerful subject matter, Prayers for Bobby is ultimately about loving and accepting your children for whoever they are. This movie was certainly a movie that would be great to watch with someone you care for, as you will be crying the whole time. many things in this beautifully made movie were more simplistic than they needed to be."
6926,"In that regard, Bale nails Connor: intense, passionate and dry without an ounce of self - reference or levity. Now the Transformers audience is a major demographic for TS, and it translates in the light - hearted, gadgety nature of the movie, and obviously in its Harvester design (who deploys mototerminators from its kneecaps). Bloodgood is a great example of the movie's ill tendencies â€” sad to say, she personifies them. This future is populated by cute kids, blood - free deaths, supermodels with perfect teeth and goofball terminators that shoot themselves in the foot. But quite honestly, massive mythology discrepancies aside, there is simply far too many wrist - slashingly bad / expository lines and heavy - handed metaphors in the script for this to even work as a standalone movie (thanks, Haggis)."
6927,"Hank Azaria is hilarious as Kahmunrah, he stole a lot of the scenes he was in. Hank Azaria puts a bit of a strange personality for Kahmunrah, but he provides quite a few good laughs. Robin Williams is wasted as Teddy, but shines with the scenes he has. Ben Stiller is slumming it here, on auto pilot so to speak, and everything just seems so crammed together with not that much heart or effort into it, but the effects definitely were. "" Night at the Museum 2 "" sucks the magic out of the original and overdoses on characters as well as meandering sarcasm and awkward humor."
6939,"Their sitcoms have been hilarious along with most of their movies. If your someone who seen a lot of movies and get the parodies will find some of it to be very slightly amusing. While this film definitely had it's share of funny jokes, there was nothing original to it. A lot of the quotes from the original movies that it was spoofing were kept the same or extremely similar, without much humor really added. Sometimes the best comedy is the one thats politically incorrect & free to be itself."
8346,"It was also pretty nice to see his ability to improv as the opening to the special, didn't really go his way, due to certain late guests. Despite his crudeness, Williams entices with a certain sense of wit and wordplay to his mannerisms and lectures. The way, he created voice impressions of people, including Walter Cronkite, Bill Clinton, Jimmy Stewart, Popeye and others here were amazing. "" Robin Williams: Weapons of Self Destruction "" is a great addition to any fan of either Robin Williams or the stand - up comedy genre in general. "" Robin Williams: Weapons of Self Destruction "" is a hoot."
6934,"The film introduces a very important idea: mentally ill people do better if there is someone, whom they trust, who takes an abiding interest in them. Robert Downey, Jr. gives a fine performance. If you're really interested in the truth about schizophrenia there is an excellent DVD documentary called Take These Broken Wings: Recover from Schizophrenia without Medication by Daniel Mackler Production design and costumes are detailed and realistic. **** Putting all of this aside, SOLOIST derives its tremendous energy and appeal from the undeniable on - screen chemistry of Robert Downey, Jr. and Jamie Foxx."
6936,"Lohman is very good in this, creating a character of equal parts spunk and sweetness. One of the best Horror movies of 2009. Disturbing images and a nice score, neatly edited and shot. So incredibly refreshing to see a horror film with out the hallmarks of the recent saw franchise. But the good certainly outweighs and bad and this schlocky gross and funny horror flick is very re-watchable, and above all unique."
8164,"Gillen and Birtwistle are rather splendid as the fraught interlopers. A movie this good will be noted for it's few imperfections. Patrick and Louise get involved and the consequences are bloody but rather brilliant. Well written, with the first hour devoted to setting up and exploring a good variety of tastefully presented horrors. This is a great wee story with all the trademarks of what made Hammer films so spellbinding in the first place."
6937,"From the beginning, Disney has always had a finger on the pulse of youngsters. Viewed at the Festival de Cannes 2009 The opening film of this year's festival, and the first animated film ever to have this honour, Up is truly a film for all ages. It is frequently thrilling and exciting, and lets up only for a few moments at a time. Pixar Studios has gotten to be one of those movie icons that shouldn't even have to deliver a premise to get funded anymore. This isn't slapstick humour, although there are some lovely visual gags, but deeper, more thoughtful."
8147,"The transformation just in his eyes is astonishing. This is a very strong movie in many respects. David Dencik got the meaty role in Jimmy, and he pulls it off brilliantly. This film is real just like pure emotions. The two lead actors were absolutely great and believable in their performances."
8116,"The characters are very likable and you do identify them from the get go, the women especially the titular character are really beautiful especially. This is certainly one of the best ventures into animated comic book movies. And both parts are done wonderfully that makes this accessible to men, women, geek, and non-geek. However, on the straight - to - DVD universe, an excellent animated version of Wonder Woman was made. One of the best DC movies along with the live - action Batman movie."
6941,"Hard to believe, but it was the great chemistry of the two bromantic leads! Finally, the characters are interesting and their dialogs are well written. They play off each other perfectly, and because they're sharply versed with each other, it's instantly believable that they're also sharply - witted with others. A good cast who can carry this off with panache and a definite sense of sporting fun - it is part pastiche of sporting movies - all help the time whiz by. But overall it was an enjoyable funny teen comedy with hilarious moments."
8108,"And how wonderful to see Claudia Cardinale again. As his love interest, Salim Kechiouche seems perfectly fitted for the role. Writers, director and a wonderful cast. For this film, directed and written by Mehdi Ben Attia does that very thing. As her gay son, Atonin Stahly, too, is wonderful."
6942,"TLJ hits Dave Robicheaux on the button. The settings, whether swamps at night, Southern mansions, broken down shacks, or merely country scenery all seemed highly realistic. But the best is Mary Steenburgen as Bootsie. The place names, the rustic look of old frame houses, the backwater bayous with lush vegetation, those wonderful Louisiana accents, the outdoor barbecue at a plantation house. So, solid direction, much strong acting, faithful to the book, great sets and setting, all brought lower by some bad casting."
8058,"Viewers can expect great action and comedy like the television series. The mutated animals are very creative and his two major crew members are creative as well. They still do stuff important to the plot, get some funny lines in here and there and them having a few minutes of fighting is better than no fighting at all. In addition to that, Oda designed several amazing fantasy creatures like the eel shark, the snake necked giraffe, the long armed wrestling bear and so on. Shiki's kingdom is just pure eye candy."
6943,"Zach Galifianakis, in particular, was brilliant. The cast were excellent with a truly great dynamic of main characters played by very talented comedic actors. Up to that point, Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Justin Bartha, and Zach Galifianakis carried the movie briskly and with real chemistry. Plot: The idea of forgetting what happened in the night time and trying to put all the pieces together in the morning, yeah it's clever. The acting wasn't very impressive either, particularly that of Zach Galifianakis."
8014,"Plus a few comedic bits are also worth it. There are great Korean filmmakers such as Bong Joon Ho (The Host) and Park Chan Wook (Oldboy). The director of this film, J. K. Youn, has been notorious for literally copying American comedy hits of the past and' translating' them into Korean for quick bucks movies. Some fade - to - black - at - opportune - moments also came to the rescue of the film, and cheesiness reined comical supreme needlessly as well, though no efforts were spared in others especially the one involving the little girl left in the hotel room, providing that edge - of - your - seat thrills in what would be a literal roller - coaster ride in the last half hour. Disaster movies have are part of a big tradition, and any number of them have been effective in their own ways."
6944,"The sound and post production was perfect, a litany of heart thudding moments and breath holding captured by the crescendo of rushing winds and thudding acorns. Lars Von Trier is back in his hypnotic visual style and mindfuc * ing storytelling, and this is where he is best! They are amazing and deserve Oscars. Of course its scenes of mutilation and have a visceral power, but this is cheaply achieved. When the couple are later kept awake by acorns falling on the roof of the cabin, She tells Him that it takes a hundred years for an oak to reproduce itself just once."
6946,"Seeing acquaintances and colleagues help each other out, and giving hand made gifts is refreshing. Though its payoff scenes are as predictable as could be, this entertaining romantic comedy is an effective vehicle sure to please Renee Zelweger fans. RenÃ©e Zellweger, Harry Connick Jr. and J. K. Simmons are a pleasure to watch as always, and the lesser known actors such as Siobhan Fallon are excellent too. The jokes and quips were cute, and the exaggerations on small town life were amusing. New in Town is not in the league of the great old movies of Riskin and Capra, but is genuinely amusing and a fine platform for Zellweger to display both physical & romantic comedy skills."
6947,"Tommy Wirkola is a clearly talented director and hopefully a promising long career awaits him. This film has the best tag line ever: Ein! But this one really delivers, and all the clichÃ©s are used to benefit the film. The young cast are the staple stereotypes of the genre. A lot of references to Evil Dead here, a lot of fun, stupendous gore, with all the guts and brains and blood you would ever want."
7838,"The art style, sound effects, animation, story line everything is just so spectacular. Its just such a fun fast ride, the ending is pretty clichÃ© but it delivers what it sets out to do, which is just be as awesome and amazing as possible. The stylish character's designs and the excellent animation from this film, combined with a funny storyline and likable character made this film a highly enjoyable experience. 5/5 This is as close as you can get to perfection, everything was amazing, the only "" flaw "" is the ending but its just so clichÃ© , but with the world this is taking place in, the different array of vehicles all going up against each other and the obstacles that keep popping up, its just fun."
7799,"A rather short feature film that was chock full of fine performances and ideas. Given that the film originated as a short film, these scenes seem like filler meant to bring it to feature length. Peter Ferdinando gives a brilliant performance and carries Tony, realistically, through a wide range of scenarios, from unprovoked arguments, to awkward job interviews. The film is shot extremely well, with contrasting scenes of Tony's claustrophobic, spartan council flat and oddly lush views of a very grim looking London, complete with drug addicts, street walkers, homeless people, and a generally disenfranchised looking populace. But it's Peter Ferdinando who really stands out here, creating a character that deserves to take pride of place next to other famous filmic serial killers such as Henry, Patrick Bateman, Dr Lecter and Ezra Cobb from Deranged, with a pitch - perfect tone that would, in all honesty, creep you out if you ever met him on the street."
6948,"When Matt Lauer, playing himself, is the funniest thing in a movie, you know that something went horribly wrong. Granted the last half hour is a bit of a drag compared to the first hour, the movie is still full of laughs and unbelievably original story - line. Oh well, the movie goer should always make up their own minds. Yes the costumes are weak in detail, and the whole interaction between the humans and animals is far - fetched, but that's the whole point of the comedy: it's supposed to make you laugh."
6950,"the gritty feel, the outstanding David Shire soundtrack, the believable performances of the ensemble cast. Denzel also did a great job as this poor man who just coincidentally was having an average day and now all of a sudden has the added pressure of having lives depend on him. Gandolfini, Guzman and Turturro all do the good work you would expect from them, although again all are limited by the material. Washington had the harder job and suggests he could have done it with better material and direction â€“ instead he is thrown into forced dialogue and unlikely semi-action sequences towards the end. It's easy to watch with actors of Washington and Travolta's caliber at work, but Scott's direction is pretentious and throws out some obligatory action scenes that seem to exist for the sole purpose of padding the time on the way to an expected climax."
6951,"The movie is in no way slow, and compliments it's attributes quite nicely. The 1st 45 minutes is WELL worth seeing. The film looks gorgeous (and not just the two lead actors): the prettiness of the interior sets is matched by the choice of locations. If everything was excellent, it would become the norm, and it would cease to be special. There are quite a few witty lines and exchanges, and the delivery and timing of the two stars and, of course, of Betty White are just about perfect."
6952,"but the sets are impressive and everyone involved seems to be having fun. The Holy Grail, Office Space, Borat, Austin Powers, Happy Gilmore. It's f-ing hilarious and you'll really enjoy getting the opportunity to laugh out loud for 90 minutes then go see this. The natural humans are powerful and fit, but a little lacking in philosophy. There are plenty of scenes that will give you laughs that pass as abruptly as they come and a few that are longer lasting."
6956,"The Limits are a very different animal: Visually, the potent use of color alone, sets it far apart (Theories on the use of dark orange, anyone? ) This movie is an instant classic, uncompromisingly inviting the viewer to fill in the blanks while being enchanted and entertained. In the beautiful and enigmatic The Limits of Control, director Jim Jarmusch puts it this way, "" The universe has no center and no edges "" and, "" everything is subjective "", or "" reality is arbitrary "". "" The Limits of Control "" plays with a lot of established film clichÃ©s, and it teases you with your expectations. For those who have been devouring movies for some time, who know a thing or two about their strengths and weaknesses, and the way they tell stories, this film is an incredible piece of art."
6960,"She adds class and perfection to everything she does. The story, the direction, the acting - yes, Larry David was perfect for this. Mr. Allen is in top form here and it would have been great seeing Allen play Allen, although Larry David is good. It's the funniest one from Woody since maybe Deconstructing Harry. It was a risky casting move on Mr. Allen's part, but it worked beautifully."
6961,"But not everything is bad, for example, the locations are great, the landscapes are beautiful. His flowing hair and Hollywood - tinted big glasses call to mind producer Robert Evans (The Kid Stays in the Picture). Connor Mead (Matthew McConaughey) a famous photographer that has pretty much slept with a lot of women, some are clients. Its a romantic comedy that can take you away a few laughs. Matthew McConaughey is hilarious in the role of a cynical bachelor and shows a great chemistry with Jennifer Garner."
6962,"What's good: Johnny Depp and Christian bale are good, the pacing is good, the sets and period detail are perfect. The cars, headlights, street lights, and everything looked fantastic. The thing that is most fascinating about this film is the costumes and sets. On the plus side, yes: great clothes, great cars, great location shots, superb editing and beast of all great gunfights. The guy had been in stir 9 years; he had a lot of catching up to do."
6963,"The chases are more exciting, the locations more real, it works so well! It has just as much humour to keep the grown ups happy as it does the kids. Dino babies and mammal kids are ridiculously endearing. It's everything a great family film should be. "" Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs "" is a wonderful and entertaining tale of love and friendship, with adorable characters and witty situations."
6964,"It wrapped everything up real nice and had a moving ending. That's great for fans of the show. Among the greatest new things of this is Lori Petty's performance, which nails the type with flawless precision. The movie was a return to the shows beginnings and was terrific! The result is a fast paced, exciting and emotion filled adventure full of twists and the movie's touching coda."
6966,"Everyone did a great job as far as performances are concerned. The character development is outstanding, you get to know each character and you understand each of their perspectives. The performances are good from everyone. It tackles several issues and does so with finesse and without the over the top melodrama movies of this type so often have. With this and his previous, "" Alpha Dog "", Cassavete's signals himself as a real filmmaker as he rarely ever hits a false note."
6968,"She's all over this one, easily one of her top performances to date. Summer, played by Zooey Deschanel, is fun, beautiful and selfish. With some great performances lately for Joseph Gordon - Levitt, his stock is rising. Gordon - Levitt and Deschanel have great chemistry together and give solid performances. The film shows the good and the bad of love, relationships, and life."
6970,"Cohen is a brilliant improviser and always two steps ahead of his targets. It will once again lead to lots of controversy and imitation at thousands of workplaces around the globe. Humanities finest moments certainly aren't on display here. But packed into those few minutes you will find all the best scenes from the film, and there's very little worth watching in the remainder. The humour in the film is clearly that of in - your - face slapstick, however given the extremes the film goes to, it's all relatively entertaining."
6973,"So, basically, the movie was more like a 99 percent Ron - and - Lavender - and - Hermione love triangle than a Harry - and - Ginny or a Harry - and - Dumbledore - and - memories sort of thing. A rock concert tribute to Dumbledore. After a great opening, Harry, Ron, and Hermoine return for their sixth year at Hogwarts and then, nothing. At the end of the movie the audience should be lamenting Dumbledore's horrific death, but the movie moved so fast it was hard to truly wrap your mind around one scene before another began. In short, this film is great if all you took out of the book was the romance and funny bits."
6977,"It's enjoyable in places but perplexing ultimately. Great performances, especially by Heath Ledger and Colin Farrell. And yet on further viewings Bridges' performance seems superb, Willis' perhaps the best of his career. It's a brilliant film--there are fabulous, fantastic, surrealistic visual effects; gorgeous cinematography; and stunning performances by an amazing cast of consisting of both famous stars and lesser known (but excellent) actors. Its like Alice in Wonderland went slightly more over-the-edge, and some while some bits are truly bizarre, its all quite fascinating, especially when it is first re-introduced after the middle."
6980,"Her ability to manipulate her siblings as well as her adoptive father, thoroughly frustrates the mother. If you were still interested or if you're a horror fan that is able to look past some clichÃ©s and logical jumps in exchange for horrific chills, you'll have a fun time. Where the problems come in is with motivation and plot depth. It's far from perfect though - there are way too many predictable jump / false scares, with the soundtrack blaring to try to startle the viewer. There are plenty of fun and playful tension - relieving scenes, and several cathartic moments when the audience erupted into cheers."
6981,"That said, the cast is really delightful, for Heigl and Butler make a most attractive. John Michael Higgins and Cheryl Hines do their best to steal some thunder, yet, thinking back, their most successful moments are a result of reactions to what Butler and / or Heigl did. It truly is designed for both men and women with fantastic views on romance, sex, attraction etc from both sides. His brief seconds of screen time, with either a facial expression or quick quip, are gold. The whole moral of the movie is something both guys and women can you relate to, and some scenes are just hilarious for all types of audiences."
6984,"There are the kind of moments where your kids will ask you to rewind and watch it again. Probably most of the criticisms one can read in the other reviews have merit. All of the kids do a great job, and the voice talents behind the aliens bring a lot of personality to those characters in only a few scenes. There are a handful of moments in this film that had the entire audience laughing uncontrollably. "" Aliens in the Attack "" is an underrated and funny family entertainment."
6985,"Family and friendship are still important ideals in their world. After seeing his masterful Lord of the Rings saga, anyone can see that he knows what he is doing. And boy, those weapons are awesome! Neill Blomkamp does a tremendous job with the direction and realism of the film. For a first effort, Neill Blomkamp has created one of the best SciFi for a while, his future work will be well worth paying attention to."
6986,"A fun time at the movies--which is a rarer pleasure than it should be. She's a blogger with the soul of a clerk. The good parts of "" Julie and Julia "" are so darn strong, beautiful, and new that J&J becomes an instant classic. Meryl Streep as Julia Child is one of the most endearing, arresting performances ever. This film is all the more remarkable in that it is so rare to see a film these days that just revels in joie - de-vivre."
6987,"The gal of the pair, Sara, is played by AnnaSophia Robb. Dwayne Johnson (formally known as the Rock) takes over Eddie Albert's part as the earthman who befriends the two young aliens, the difference is that Eddie Albert could act a lot better! The film briefly makes the parallel to the Alien Bounty Hunter, who is a military agent from the teen - aliens' planet. Garry Marshall, Carla Gugino, and others bring a wealth of credits to the table and are a credit to their parts. Now the moments between Dwayne and the kids are memorable."
6988,"Ahh, the wonderful 80s to be growing up. Basically, if you like the aforementioned movies you will probably enjoy this one. Being a young kid during the 80's was awesome. This movie has a lot of laughs in it, although probably not where the filmmakers intended. This results in some really good action scenes including the Eiffel Tower coming down."
6989,"Even the Russians are pretty good. Giamatti being curious decides to check it out. A different and interesting, if not excellent, picture that is an ideal watch on DVD. Barthes is a startlingly assured first - time director: The production values are impeccable (the soul - removal facility is all gorgeous minimalism, smooth white and glass), and she coaxes better - than - average performances out of even dependably intelligent actors like Giamatti and David Strathairn. Cold Souls, featuring Paul Giamatti, Emily Watson and David Strathairn is wonderful."
6995,"Will Ferrell was amazing as a character more crass than ever before and veteran actors Alan Thicke and Ving Rhaymes surprise with their character - breaking roles. Ving Rhames plays his role with audacity, as do both Kathryn Hahn and David Koechner, all three exceptional comedians in their own right. On the opposite side of this is Ving Rhames, who gives a surprisingly funny comic performance as a mack - daddy who's had sex with hundreds of women. Hence extreme times like this meant to engage an external, proved consultant, and that's Don Ready (Jeremy Piven) and his team of Jibby Newsome (Ving Rhames), Brent Gage (David Koechner) and Babs Merrick (Kathryn Hahn). His group then takes over, orders new TV spots made, sets up an Astro - Jump for the kiddies and brings in a DJ who refuses to take requests (Craig Robinson, "" Zack and Miri Make a Porno, "" Darryl in "" The Office "")."
6996,"The expressions are pitch perfect and his portrayal never appears as caricature. Instead he relies on small gestures and certain facial expressions which results in a very moving and impressive performance. There's an excellent introduction using the story of Le Petit Prince (The Little Prince) by Saint - ExupÃ©ry as a metaphor. This is one of the most complete films in terms of quality of writing, direction, and overall superb technical film - making. All this comes into play most dramatically however when a new neighbour, Beth (Rose Byrne), moves in above Adam's apartment."
6998,"In spite of this, Rachel McAdams is stunning. The point is McAdams captures both Clare's humanity and angst. And moments after that, his future self (Eric Bana) arrives to assure him that things will get better. But, like a diamond set off by smaller jewels, McAdams and Bana are surrounded by exquisite little gems from the supporting performers, notably Brooklynn Proulx as young Clare and the McCann sisters, Hailey and Tatum, as their dotter Alba at ages 10 and 5. Other than that, the two leads were solid and the movie is entertaining."
6999,"There's a lot of fun and changing of scenes in this movie and a lot of romantic moments as well. So on one hand, you crafted some mindshare into the object of your desire, and on the other, you've made a slew of enemies ever ready to bay for your blood. Denis (Paul Rust) gives a final speech as he graduates and proclaims his love for Beth Cooper (Hayden Panettiere) while doing so. Rich is a character in extremely terrible taste, although he has the only funny part where his character has been training to hurt someone with a wet towel. But Beth's meat head boyfriend Kevin is none - too - pleased that his high school prize is mingling with the biggest dweeb in school, and when Kevin shows up at his house and tears the place apart in a fit of rage Denis, his best friend Rich, Beth, and her friends Cammy and Treece all pile into Beth's car and flee for their lives."
7001,"Whatever it is, G - force is fun with 3 - D. Kids would like the cute animals coming near them. The interaction between human and creature is still noticeably fake, even after all these years they can't seem to perfect this. The storyline was fast paced, the animation and effects superb and the guinea pigs were generally funny. To begin with the positives, the animation is top - notch. Their mouths alone are cutely depicted and entertaining in their own right."
7007,"1/10 with 2 , 128 votes) is an evidence of the foregoing statement. While she isn't Meryl Streep she plays the role of Ryden with great presence. Alexis Bledel, from "" The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants "", is one of the most beautiful actresses of the younger generation and the role of Ryden Malby seems to be tailored for her. However, it is still a cute movie that allows you to escape for an hour and forty minutes. Bledel has a certain charm, a certain spark in her, but she is stuck with a character you simply can't like."
7009,"For the personal memories, he absolutely nailed it! Elliot's struggles and evolution through this unique event are another of Ang Lee's wonderfully textured allegories. Very good actorial interpretations (Imelda Staunton playing the mother is simply wonderful), although the characters themselves appear to be looking for a soundtrack which lacks till the end. Demetri Martin plays Elliot Tiber (Teichberg) and does a fine job as the son torn between independence and duty to his aging parents, Imelda Staunton and Henry Goodman (five - star performances by both). Obviously, Ang Lee drifts attention from the concerts and the music of those three epic days in 1969 to focus on the personal story of a young man and his odd family who worked and lived in the background of this great event."
7010,"These movies didn't take themselves very seriously, and while gory, were also at least a little bit fun to watch. , and a love for characters that give the phrase "" poor white trash "" a whole new meaning (do these people EVER clean anything? ) It took some of the things that made the original Halloween so great in many people's eyes and switched them around completely. As well, Meyer's is followed by his deceased mother, himself in child - form and a gigantic white horse, seemingly all figments of his imagination. In this movie, Michael Myers went on a happy and silly killing spree, popping up everywhere at the same time, with such silly and extremely loud stabbing sounds!"
7011,"that said, it's probably worth watching on the big screen just for the sights and sounds. And even with this there's certain twists, or unexpected pleasures. It's rare a filmmaker can conjure something like that, but 9 has that in spades. PIXAR has its wonders, but to see this is to see the A-game upped another notch in the medium and its potential. The atmospheric score and use of imagery from various real political movements and historic events added to the post-apocalyptic, almost Gothic feel."
7020,"The support cast is perhaps a bit too full of well - known faces but everyone is good, working again with the approach. From the opening credits, viewers are immersed in the simple, charming vibe of small - town Illinois; this ambiance is benefited by the fact that Soderbergh chose to film in Decatur, the very town in which the real - life events occurred. Everything feels authentic, from the hairstyles to the ADM office and even the colorful array of ties sported by various cast members throughout the movie. "" The Informant "" tells the real life story of Mark Whitacre, the highest ranked executive to ever turn whistleblower in U. S. history. Coming to it on its own terms however this is an engaging story told with a comic air that works and makes the film as entertaining as it is interesting."
7013,"Even though just about one of the three central actors has had major exposure on British TV and more recently, cinema, the performances are pitch - perfect. Anna Faris delivers a great performance as she sparks the silver screen with her natural abilities of a comedian and all the other actors such as Chris O'Dowd, Dean Lennox Kelly etc. both interacts realistically with each other, forming brilliant chemistry. Unexpected twists are everywhere, but the great thing about them is that they all make sense when the movie is over, which is something some of the more recent Hollywood Sci - Fi's could take note of. The acting is spirited, especially with Chris O'Dowd and Marc Wooton who both show a lot of spontaneous boyish charm that make their characters appealing. With some spot on performances and a tight script, Frequently Asked Questions is a smart and very funny take on the science - fiction genre that mixes situation with character humour effectively."
7014,"Acting is top notch by the whole cast, especially children's faces beam just like in Bergman films. Haneke's Brechtian distancing effects at times feel gimmicky. Michael Haneke has directed his vision in a very masterful and artful way: the cinematography, the acting, and the script are all superb. This is an important statement, as it provides a guide as to how Haneke intends this film to be viewed. All the crimes which take place in this film form an intricate web of "" causes "" and "" effects ""."
7016,"Also, everything here is properly lit. In terms of film - making, this is a rather well put together film. He really knows how to handle suspense and build up intense scenes. PANDORUM is a good way to enter this fall season. The film does feature a solid cast that deliver solid performances, thick atmosphere, several scares, a few unexpected twists, astonishing special effects and set pieces, and quite a bit of gore."
7017,"One piece leads to another piece, and another set of possibilities. Audiences will be able to see it again in years to come with more objectivity and appreciate it much more. It was intelligent and funny, and will probably be appealing to more open - minded viewers. All the performances are superb, it's just the audiences that have become witless. The cast is fun but reeks of pre-sales needs."
7019,"The performances of both are worthy of accolades. The leads are both very good. Finally, Kusama's direction is swift and competent. The movie has great direction from Karyn Kusama. She manages to create some very humorous moments while being natural."
7039,"This time they have been successful and everything seems completely fine. If you want something different to the blockbusters, watch it. Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en EspaÃ±ol, are most welcome! He has also been greatly influenced by classics like ROSEMARY'S BABY, WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE and near - Cult Classics like IT'S ALIVE! Dr. Lang is a New Age Lesbian."
7021,"The running time is perfect at 90 minutes. Others are good in their context. If you can view this without any expectations you may find that is a quite remarkable film and definitely deserves a rating higher than 7. All the characters seem to be performing on a high wire and carry themselves very naturally. Clifton Collins Jr. is great as well, while Mila Kunis is almost as out of place as she was in "" Max Payne ""."
7022,"For the love of god EMOTE. FD1 had Seann William Scott & Kerr Smith, FD2 has Ali Later & FD3 had the immensely talented Mary Elizabeth Winstead. And as embodied by the narrative shortcuts this gorefest constantly employs, the Rube Goldberg set pieces start to feel less impressive than mechanical, which makes one believe that Death has worked itself too much over the last three installments. What this movie is really about is killing young, attractive individuals in a manner which will compliment the 3D. While the very first movie had a spectacular, and some say too realistic for good taste in having witness from within a plane break up and explode upon take - off, this one had an adrenaline pumping race that got enhanced thanks to the latest gimmick in town , 3D."
7023,"Although it is certainly a film with many short comings, it's entertaining and presents an interesting world with some scary realizations. In MMO's today, you have a-holes who will screw up other people's fun and during one of the society scenes, there is an example of this with the roller blading. The movie being "" abstract "" worked very well for everything besides the slayers sequences, but those were surprisingly short. The motion picture provides fast and furious amusement with spectaculars scenes. One query, however, is over the high level of violence and some erotic scenes that contain this exciting film."
7024,"Children with definitely love it, and adults. It had an ADHD spirit with wonderfully over-the-top characters. It was creative, extremely fun, and paid reference to everything from "" Independence Day "" to "" The Twilight Zone "". The character designs were all original and cute. Regardless, the animation was stunning, combining a tribute to Ron Barret's amazing illustrations in background with pleasantly cartoony characters."
7026,"The performances, every single one of them, are all top notch. She gives one of the best performances of the year. If you have seen Wook's previous works / movies you know he is very visual (in a good way) and it shows again here. Jaw - dropping violence, tasteful gore, great humour, incredible suspense and even very realistic sex scenes. It's unpredictable - scenes go from brutal and heart - wrenching to laugh - out - loud hilarious in an instant."
7031,"The plot is original and comes with a couple of unforgettable twists. World's Greatest Dad is brilliant and provocative. As a parent of teenagers, the abrupt 360 degree attitudinal shift of the kids seemed entirely realistic. Suburbia has transformed from an innocent place with friendly neighbors to a world full of miserable, sometimes disturbed people, dreams deferred, and earth - shattering secrets. "" World's greatest dad "" is one of the best movies of the year."
7034,this look suits salman very well. in fact its one of his best performances tilldate. Ayesha Takia was at her best. Ayesha Takia looks stunning and her chemistry with Sallu does work! This movie is definitely meant for the masses with cool dialogs.
7035,From the outside the town seems to be devoted to the majestic creatures swimming off it's shores. You will find all those dolphins you love are not happy. The film was made with great risks involved and all who took part in making it have to be commended for their courage and desire to show the truth. The quantity in question (23' 000 annual catch of dolphins at a selling price of $500 each means a commerce of 11. One of the marks of a powerful documentary is the response it generates from the hordes of nay Sayers.
7036,"Even the friggin' parking lot is a divine miracle! That's their strength and it's all over "" Serious Man . "" A Serious Man is beautiful, profound, and perfectly well made. There are so many perfectly framed scenes that even when the story seems to drag it keeps you captivated. The Road and A Serious Man both belong in the category of' agonizing to watch . )"
7037,"All the performances are first - rate! Plotted somewhat like a farce but as emotionally resonate as the best comedy - dramas, City Island is most aptly described, simply and literally, as wonderful. Out on DVD today, it is one of the best movies of the year. Marguiles was marvelous as Joyce, and Strait was straight as an arrow with his thespian work as Tony. Andy Garcia and Julianna Margulies put their heart and soul into this project, with pretty convincing Bronx accents and characters."
7038,"This is far better than anything at the theaters now a days and was so well done in every aspect of it. A very ambitious project for such a low budget, it has a large cast, many locations and very effective visual effects. Jamin Winans has crafted a minor masterpiece. More importantly, it has an interesting and inventive story line, memorable characters inhabited by capable performances and a great pace to the editing. It's not a masterpiece, but it's really quite well done, despite some fairly weak acting (in some places it's downright cringe - worthy . )"
7042,"And those moments are worth the price of admission alone. There are some nice short scenes with Tina Fey, Jeffrey Tambor and others. The movie first draws laughs by setting up this type of world. It is thus a BLEAK world (which is cleverly in direct contrast to the beautiful locations the movie was filmed in). On the DVD, there's a great 7 minute prequel, which apparently was supposed to be the beginning of the movie."
7044,""" Surrogates "" is the latest of these concepts and surprisingly one of the more well thought - out ones. Second is the way the movie creates this amazing - looking world of a future inhabited mostly by surrogates. Surrogates oozes intrigue, even if it doesn't quite deliver on the smartness written on the page. They work, play and travel via their surrogates, from the comfort of their home. The result of this new era of existence is the dramatic drop in violent crimes, sexually transmitted diseases, death by accident, etc. ."
7045,"Recently, these low - lives attempted a bank hold - up that went hilarious awry for the silliest of excuses. None of the character are able to catch your attention and involve you in the story, although Omari Hardwick (playing a drug dealer wanting out of business) does his sincerest best to bridge the script shortcomings. As can be expected it is a mix of unabated comedy with brutal gangsters, fast talking criminals and crazy sequence of events ending with a grand showdown finale to tie all the separate plots and characters together. This was a funny movie about the perils of being high while on the job. Some may enjoy this sort of comedy, but it just tries to show more of the black foolishness similar to Tyler Perry's movies, but at least Tyler Perry's movies are sometimes funny this is not."
7046,"There is one unforgettable cameo appearance that will take place at someone's Beverly Hills mansion. This is captured best in the intro as you almost feel like you are supposed to have the 3D glasses in place. It has a sleek, very modern sense of style - just watch for how each rule makes it's appearance / reappearance and a good message on the importance of others in the worst of times. After dropping you in the action right from the start, the movie keeps coming with constant laughs and good action. Next to that of Woody Boyd on Cheers and Frasier, this is definitely the best performance of his career."
7047,"It's worth a watch on Telly or DVD that's for sure, it passes the time well. 2 completely different audiences and intents, but both great movies that deliver what they try to deliver. A lot of the film's power centers around the heroine's human side, and accordingly she reacts in human ways. But if you focus on the underlying human story instead of the thrills & chills, it's a refreshing change from the cartoony action flicks of recent years. Kate Beckinsale isn't in the front ranks of thespians, but she's a solid leading lady, and brings a good mix of likability, vulnerability and toughness to this part."
7048,"It's a joy on all these levels. In the cinema certain historical periods have become associated with a particular set of ideas. One of the best British films of recent years. Expect to see An Education at the top of the upcoming "" best "" lists of 2009, and even at the Kodak theatre in February next year, with high chances of collecting Oscar gold. *** Major Spoilers *** "" An Education "" is an entertaining little film, well done in all respects and superbly acted."
7058,"It's the tiniest of inflections but it is effective nonetheless. Most professional reviewers share the same conclusion. Though her performances in Boys Don't Cry and Million Dollar Baby are more impressive, this is a finely tuned character she has developed and a very likable one. Poignant moments come and go with no warning or conclusion, rendering them meaningless and out of context. Plenty of biographies have been written about Ms. Earhart already, the facts belong there."
7050,"While he is saddled with the worst scenes in the film, he delivers the strongest and most consistent work. A few good laughs in an otherwise mediocre script and a movie that isn't quite sure of its target audience. The storyline is as tired as old leather, but there are just enough witty remarks to keep this trite comedy drifting along. Favreau puts in some really great work as a man just counting down the days until he and his wife file for divorce. Joey (Favreau) just wants to get off; Shane (Faison Love) wants to pretend he's young and also avoid the pain of his divorce; Dave and Ronnie (Vaughn and Akerman) go along because they're good sports."
7053,"Jonze's creation is a masterful piece of art, both visually arresting and exquisitely affecting. As soon as you can open up yourself to these being real beings, not just animatronics, the whole emotional core of the film opens up as well. To be able to accept others, one must always be able to accept oneself. This becomes the biggest obstacle for Max to overcome, right alongside his fantastical equal in Carol, (James Gandolfini). The scenes with the wild things are very physical, which will help to keep children's attention."
7059,"After 5 years in the making it is definitely worth watching The fact that it's in the form of claymation only helps to enhance uniqueness of the whole experience. Most importantly though, his lovably oddball characters are well developed and admirably complex with all their awkward traits and quirks. It happens to be more contemplative, and intelligent mimicking the real life with all its ups and downs. The use of gray colour with a splash of red when showing the scenes with Max, was very effective, and give the audience the sense of what Max was feeling."
7060,"When you put them all together, Up in the Air resonates on so many levels; deserving of any praise and accolades to be bestowed upon it. Vera Farmiga's performance is seductively natural. net If you liked this come read more reviews http: / / www. It has what the 2004 film Sideways lacked, the emotional edge. He is so proficient at it, when he meets his "" expert traveler "" equivalent, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga); he is emotionally drawn to another person, beyond a passing interest, for the first time."
7061,"It looks beautiful especially in the colours which are bright and colourful, and the music is jaunty and rousing. between this and the film, the film is a very unpredictable script to it, but this is far more interesting, Mutant pumpkins from outer space! And Reese Witherspoon right in the middle of it as voice actress of the main female character. This Halloween special is even better than the movie from which the characters come from! It's a fun watch for 30 minutes."
7062,"The characters at their best, particularly Monami and Mizushima, are surprisingly fleshed out, likable and quite funny; at their worst, over-the-top caricatures that are usually funny and always interesting. This is the love - child of a three - way between Looney Tunes, an early Peter Jackson film and a Troma movie. Perhaps the funniest scenes involve those lampooning current teenage trends. Combining a plethora of practical and CG effects, the organ - bursting final twenty minutes of this gem feel less like TOKYO GORE POLICE and more like the work of Tex Avery. The emphasis more than obviously lies on the splatter orgies and nefarious sense of humor, but there's actually also a decent storyline hidden underneath all the mayhem, with interesting lead characters and the craziest bunch of sub plots you've ever witnessed."
7063,"There is a lot answered this time around, near everything actually. There has been a lot of build - up in the previous installments, and it's happened for a reason: The pay - off is in this one. It's really incredible how everything in the plot came together so perfectly. It's smarter than the previous three and it features some of the series most interesting traps. The story was more interesting and the twists and turns were quite intriguing."
7064,"That will say more than anything else about how well done this movie is. The professionalism and patience of ortega was outstanding, he was perfect for this whole production, the cast was phenomenal, MJ was awesome. The talent, from the dancers to the musicians to the lighting and effects crew were just first rate all the way. His voice and his dance moves are top form and timeless. This is a must - see for every MJ fan and even non-fans to understand why he was so popular and deserved every bit of the title King of the Pop."
7065,"And Chris Massoglia, of course, was a great lead actor. This braver, more intense coloring was good for Cirque du Freak. From the dazzling and witty opening credits through the delightful cast and story line, this film delivers great visuals, charm and one of John C. Reilly's best performances to date! John C. Reilly gives probably the best performance in the film. Ken Watanabe is a great Mr. Tall, the boss of Cirque du Freak."
7066,"Calling relaxers "" creamy crack "" was funny and alarming at the same time. Various aspects of the movie are entertaining, amusing, or saddening, depending on how one views them. It's also interesting to see a "" hair show "" where hair stylists have these crazy elaborate, very entertaining demos of their skills. His search brings him to a hair convention in Atlanta, a barbershop in Harlem, a temple in India and many other interesting places. "" Good Hair "" is like a Halloween ride of shallow caricatures of people who has no sense of reality."
7067,"The film features a cast full of what's his faces. one of The Last Great Movie Palaces). Paying homage to such great films as Shaft, Dolemite, Coffy, and more. The deliberate continuity errors and goofs are hilarious. The way he plays it is perfect and had everyone in the cinema in fits of laughter."
7068,"An excellent achievement for both Siegler and Oswalt. The acting is surprisingly good, with both Oswalt and Corrigan turning in great performances. Big Fan stands as a profound and thoroughly remarkable character study marked by a magnetic performance of Patton Oswalt. Patton Oswalt's marvelous performance as Aufiero was of thespian Pro Bowl caliber. Simplicity is a rare commodity in today's fast moving, conglomerate world, but for Paul Aufiero (Patton Oswalt) there's only one thing that matters in his life."
7069,"The animation varied from good to excellent and the pacing avoided any significant lulls. Also, the movie moves along at a brisk clip, never becoming boring at any moment. Well, Astroboy IS well produced and IS very entertaining. It had a lot of great stuff, and some funny moments. The voice actors delivered great performances."
7071,"Fantastic Mr. Fox is something to be experienced. "" Fantastic Mr. Fox "" is a pure delight. With Fantastic Mr. Fox, he effortlessly supersedes his reputation as one of the most unique Directors of this century. They even tell you how time passes in human years and fox years and in a comical bit one human hour compare to one fox hour. If you love movies, you will love this movie."
7072,"You must see it in 3D! Carrey was muted and did a great job with some occasional clowning around. Jim Carrey is full of surprises and the entire movie is a theatrical outburst of his talent, under the brilliant direction of Robert Zemeckis. The experienced supporting cast of Oldman, Hoskins, Firth, Elwes and Wright Penn add a nice level of class to the proceedings. He's a perfect Scrooge, using his voice and mannerisms to great effect, never overplaying the role as you might expect he would."
7073,"It concerns where babies come from before the storks deliver them: from clouds, it turns out, who shape them from their own material. and a lot of dangerous babies. As with all Pixar's work, it is beautifully animated, the clouds may occasionally have a slightly cotton wool look to them, but the characters are well modelled and the colours and backgrounds are gorgeous. Of greater note that the specific laughs is the concept itself. Throughout the short it shows clouds that create infant humans and animals of all kinds and have the storks deliver them to their new families."
7074,"Drew Barrymore was absolutely magnificent as "" Little "" Edie, and Jessica Lange was amazing as "" Big "" Edie. The performances by Lange, Barrymore and Jeanne Tripplehorn will move and surprise you. Drew Barrymore's and Jessica Lange's portrayal of Little Edie and Big Edie were spot on. The HBO film fills in many of the pieces--with heartbreaking detail. The supporting cast led by Ken Howard and Jeanne Trippelhorn were excellent."
7075,"e. Super smart scientist that convinces the world and saves the day. The very moment they run out of fuel they discover that the Asian continent has moved 2500 kilometers in their direction (! ) The effects are good, but there are very few scenes with actual destruction and hi - tech effects. Not because script or acting means or worthy of anything. 20 - 30 minutes of superior effects cannot compensate for shallow story and unrealistic characters."
7076,"Richard Kelly's "" The Box "", which can be divided into three sections, deals with these themes, but goes a bit further. So far so good, the first 30 minutes of this movie are good and interesting, and you will wonder what will happen if they press the button. Richard Kelly's previous film Donnie Darko cleverly used the condition of schizophrenia to justify its excursion into paranormal activity and parallel universes. If she will push the button, Steward will give the family a staggering 1 million dollars in cash BUT someone, somewhere in the world will die. Cameron Diaz's Southern accent might be unnecessary but it is surprisingly Langella who is the most disappointing in the film, with a very unsubtly written role, as the mysterious scarred man, who seems to be hiding a military base that would make Dr. Evil proud."
7077,""" The Fouth Kind "" is a unique mix of documentary and ordinary movie, and it worked out well, though sometimes it was a bit too much with the actual footage, it was disruptive in some odd way. Go get the DVD and watch the "" original "" scenes. Some movies are done just to provide entertainment. 75 square miles, with 7 + bars and 5 + liquor stores). The movie has a lot of good tense moments with good acting but kind of start to fail with some ideas in the middle of the story, there are some flaws that make it less credible but still scary."
7078,"Mo'Nique's performance is revelatory on multiple levels, down to the bone of the human condition and certainly up to the highest screen standards. Everybody was so engaged in watching it even Gabourey Sidibe herself who had already seen it three times. Newcomer Gabourey Sidibe will absolutely be famous and definitely deserves the Best Actress Oscar. Gabourey Sibide looks and sounds a lot like the late Hattie McDaniel; if a biopic about McDaniel is ever made, Sibide should star. Director Lee Daniels (Shadowboxer) has created a very powerful film that manages to entertain while evoking a broad spectrum of emotions, from anger and heartbreaking pity to optimism, joy and hope."
7079,"BLt: PoCNO rocks and Herzog rules! Herzog was fun as always at the introductory remarks and the Q&A with TIFF programmer Colin Geddes. Good touch and the film has dozens of them. Nicholas Cage aside, Val Kilmer doesn't probably manages to do much, but Mendes and Dourif deliver convincing performances. Herzog's most entertaining film to date and Cage's best performance in ages."
7080,"Yes, the CGI was good, the Wolves were pretty great. The score was likable, and a couple of scenes were artistically shot, but even so it was nothing that would deserve a best cinematography or best director nomination. There were, however, a few welcome releases from the snail - like dialogue. Alice and the other Cullens throw her a surprise birthday party; while opening a gift, Bella accidentally gets a paper cut. Tried to remind audience of feelings of romance, and falling in love and love in itself."
7081,"The film makers are ambitious and restrained. It is a rare gem in mainstream contemporary U. S. film making. And the writing (by Camon and Moverman) acknowledges the fact that reasonably intelligent people might be watching. Oren Moverman - accomplishing this so beautifully, accurately and subtly in a small - budget film - is to be congratulated. No morals are offered, and this is the true strength of the work as a whole."
7082,"It must be noted that the extremely graphic decapitations look great though. Watch out for the opening scene and the police station scene because those scenes are epic awesome. The fight choreography is well executed with a good mix of slow motion and frantic close - ups. What the film does explosively well is decapitate, disembowel and explode it's victims across it's blood soaked screen. There are lots of really cool weapons being used in the movie as well."
7083,"The great thing is that the characters are what they are supposed to be. The story is squeaky clean, and can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Shrek and Madagascar was some of those that survived it. Likewise Mort can be relied upon for easy laughs. This is only 26 minutes long but well worth it and a valid addition to the Madagascar movies."
7084,"The scenes in Afghanistan seem authentic. Tobey Maguire, Natalie Portman, Jake Gyllenhaal and Sam Shepard have top - notch performances, giving credibility to the story. Both signs that the movie was enjoyable and touching. But it conveyed a whole roller coaster of emotions from the beginning. The growth of Jake Gyllenhaal's character, the anguish displayed by Natalie Portman, the palpable pain and suffering by Tobey Maguire, and the fear and anger displayed by the eight - year - old Bailee Madison all combine for a very gripping tale."
7087,"This was a well made film, perfectly filmed, and great performances by everybody. So many great performances by the actors. It's a study in how important environment is in the life of kids and teenagers, and how it can make a huge difference. The ideal target audience for this movie is children and adults alike. In short, the aspects of Michael's story that make it moving and inspiring were captured with skill and integrity."
7090,"It is definitely one of the best movies in the past year or so. Acting is good, sets are nice and production is good too. This is one of those oddball films that despite the fact that it boasts a fine cast, it somehow manages to slip between the cracks (at least in distribution terms). Intricate character development, superb acting, deep and very well though through screenplay and dialogues, makes this movie a brilliant and yet simple unique creation. Director Jonas Pate, moving up from producing and / or directing for television, makes the most of Thomas Moffett's script about screwed up Los Angelas arch types."
7091,"The acting is for the most part good, and some of the jokes are funny. All the actors were great, they worked well with each other, and although it may have been predictable, it was delightful Travolta and Williams are living breathing classics and make the movie well worth watching. It shows you real life situations of what could happen if you find out something unexpected in your life and anyone can relate to these situations. "" Warm and fuzzy "" scenes look contrived and phony, "" comical "" scenes are about as funny as having your teeth pulled out with a wrench and no anesthesia."
7092,"This is the stuff of great movies. Eyes, lips are shown in evidence throughout the film, and naturally, the costumes are all superb. What makes everything fly so high is a fantastic performance by Colin Firth. Behind the apparent stillness of the film there is a torrent of emotions and Colin Firth is at the very center of it. Yet the emphasis centers on their good times together - almost too good to be true."
7093,"More than anything else, this film is unique. Firstly the acting is absolutely superb with fine performances all round. All told by a cast on fire, giving intensity and sincerity at all the right junctures. Saorise Ronan is marvelous, so are Rachel Weitz and Mark Whalberg. Rachel Weisz, Mark Wahlberg, Susan Sarandon & of course Stanley Tucci (one of the finest supporting actors in modern times) are all convincing here too."
7094,"The wonderful thing about this film is its touching on all the levels. It really is a true story of epic proportions yet it's told with an intimate feel, and it is at least 98% accurate to the events of the time. Invictus certainly plucks all the heartstrings it can, but the bonus is that these events actually happened. There are some powerful scenes in this movie, as well as some intense and suspenseful ones, and even ones that'll make you smile. Nelson Mandela is the greatest and most beloved of all South Africans."
7095,"One of the strongest aspects of this musical is, of course, the music! There are some very spectacular moments of animation in this film. Disney can make good movies, and they usually do. Thanks to technology and an obvious overload of effort, this is one of the most (if not the most) colorful and vibrant - looking Disney animated movies of all - time. Disney Animation Studios has pulled it off again; they have conjured up something fresh and new and have made it entertaining."
7096,"The beauty of it is, you will find someone you know. Invariably, one replies, "" everything is fine, "" except of course it's not true. The supporting players, in this case the adult children, are all beautifully cast. Sam Rockwell and Kate Beckinsdale also are excellent. The truths, he finds, are more painful, than he could ever imagine."
7098,"A beautiful mix of country and southern - rock fits perfectly into this film with tracks such "" Mdnight Rider "" from The Allman Brothers. If you're expecting an original groundbreaking comedy, you're probably going to be disappointed by this film. OK, so it's not some great wonder - movie which will get a zillion Oscars - but hey, it was a pleasant movie to watch. OK, it might not have you rolling on the floor but it definitely had enough funny moments to make it enjoyable. Sometimes, a change is what is needed for things to go well!"
7099,"The cast of supporting players was interesting as well, lots of familiar faces. Despite the fact this is a comedy and everything will probably turn out for the best, Jordan manages to make the "" what if "" fears seem real. Her wicked laugh and affection makes for plenty of interesting scenes. Make the Yuletide Gay is fun and light - hearted with a few good laughs. The script doesn't provide a big plot - like in so many other comparable coming - of - age movies - with complicated misunderstandings, plot - shifts and all kinds of side - stories; no, it just sort of strolls along on it's basic theme and in this way gets a nice and quiet development."
7100,"Finally there's a Robo - suit vs Navi fight and it is admittedly pretty good. The Na' vi inhabit a part of the moon under which lies a large deposit of valuable minerals, and the humans are trying to get them to relocate. It is literally "" Dances with Wolves "" in space, right down to having a "" Wind in his Hair "" character as a foil to the "" new guy "". This important set of points clearly differentiates Star Wars and Hidden Fortress. The visuals in this pieces was groundbreaking."
7101,"Jim Krasinski, is especially good in his role as son - in - law. He is a combination of amusing, charming, and serious and whenever the movie starts dragging a "" dose "" of Mr. Baldwin is enough to get it back on track. This has to be his best movie in years, maybe in his entire career. In different ways, equally appealing, these guys wear their hearts on their sleeves. Alec Baldwin, in one of his best performances to date, shows immaturity and careless can get you far in a film."
7102,"It comes with sparkles of spontaneity and fun. There were many humorous antics and displays of ingenious traps. The movie's opening shot grabs you, and Guy Ritchie's directing stays gripping all the way through the end titles. The film is riveting with only a few parts that actually lag. This is one of the most entertaining thrillers of the year and the fantastic Downey Jr. and Law are a big part of the reason why."
7103,"Bridges, Gyllenhaal and Farrell have never been better, and Duvall is always pure gold. It is also just so incredibly satisfying to watch legends like Bridges and Duvall act side by side in beautiful and perfectly fitting roles such as these. Clearly he is good enough and the professional and functional songs on display here would pass twenty minutes of general inspection. ( Clever pastiche songs being a great aid to the believability . ) Her scenes with Bridges are central to the movie, and the chemistry is strong between them."
7104,"The characters stay true to themselves, much to anyone who is a fan of the original cartoon characters, and the dynamic of character triads works well for moral storytelling. It was always enjoyable watching Alvin and Britney going at it, while the other 4 tried to keep them out of trouble. None of the characters besides the main trio are interesting, the jokes fall flat, and all the high school "" trauma "" the chipmunks deal with is about as real as an episode of Saved By the Bell. if you want to rate it as art or entertainment for adults?"
7105,"this prompts his friends to rally around to help him â€“ suggesting self help techniques (very comical! ) This film does what all good fantasy films should do, it makes you feel good. Lets put it another way, King Eric will always be remembered and respected in this country by all supporters for his great ability and the respect he had for the game and his club. He will be remembered by Manchester United fans alongside greats like Best and Charlton and now also by movie fans for a touching and memorable performance in a film that deserves high praise. Manchester United fans and other football followers will enjoy some of the documentary footage."
7106,"Pretty much what you'd expect from yet another straight - to - DVD attempt at capitalizing on the already thinly - stretched "" American Pie "" name. Partly destroyed, it contains the tips and tricks on how to have sex and pleasure a women. At least there were a couple of funny lines and 3 or 4 funny scenes on that one. See how all the characters turned out ten years after high school and what hilarious scenes could unfold if they all end up really drunk at their reunion? He needs to get decent cut for what the franchise makes, otherwise, he would never in his life make such lackluster films."
7108,"Under ideal circumstances it might seem elegant. This is as good a time as any for some lighthearted teenage adventures. The dialogue between the two leads is interesting and enjoyable. Things look up when he meets neighbor Sheeni Saunders (Portia Doubleday, who is both enigmatic and ebullient as Sheeni), who's gorgeous and fun to be with. Best of all is Justin Long, who slides into the scene as Sheeni's sly older brother."
7109,"The Q&A ran well into the early morning hours. That made this a homecoming of sorts. His presence is the highlight of Daybreakers. And Let The Right One In was a foreign gem that surely ranks as one of the genres best. The entire cast--which includes Ethan Hawke, Sam Neill, William Dafoe, and Claudia Karvan â€” is on top of their game here and play the material straight, which is very refreshing."
7110,"For one rare moment, the viewer sees a direct link between their day to day life, and the far off repercussions. The strongest message is that your actions affect others. Linking the documentaries together is a series of animated fact files from Passion Pictures (famous for the Gorrilaz) and an innovative fictional subplot starring Pete Postlethwaite. The films jumps between sections in the future, documentary footage, news bulletins and superb animation. The Age Of Stupid has just opened on 78 screens across the UK - a remarkable feat for a genre - defying independent feature made on a shoe string, funded by ordinary households and distributed with a launch budget of just Â£ 130 , 000."
7113,"Thumbs up to the cast, especially Noomi. Thumbs up to the Swedish film makers. And it brings the trilogy to a satisfying conclusion when, for the first time, Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) utters the words "" Thank you "" to Michael Nyqvist (Mikael Blomkvist) for the favor he has done her in saving her life. Great conclusion to a trilogy of well done movies. It successfully explains things and closes all avenues opened by the first two films."
7114,"It has to be, Audiard knows this and has created yet another great piece of cinema for his fans. It's the small things that distinguishes this little gem from many other movies on prison culture. The film works on so many levels and yet achieves excellence in all of them. A newcomer with a little bit of TV experience, his performance carries' Un ProphÃ¨te' with amazing vigor. In the exquisite direction of Jaques Audiard, the film accelerates well through good character development and profound script."
7115,"A septic tank cleaner Sully (Hawke) wants his unborn child to have a genius IQ; a mobster boss Tarzo (D Onofrio) wants to become truly famous; and Jasper (Cassel), a deaf mute butcher, plays the horses and does dirty work for Tarzo. If you like off - beat, unusual films, and directors who aren't afraid to go out on a limb, and sharp small characters, you'll have a good time with this one. Vincent D'Onofrio and Seymour Cassel were outstanding in their roles as gangster and cohort / victim. Seymour Cassel proved once again why he is a great character veteran, able to express his whole role with his face and eyes. Great performances from all of the main cast; Ethan Hawke plays the dumb Sully Halverson with great aplomb, Vincent D'Onofrio is perfect as Parmie Tarzo and Seymour Cassel is superb as Jasper Sabiano."
7116,"Collapse is an amazing documentary that works on several levels. This ex-cop is well - spoken it is very obvious that he has given conferences and presentations as he begins to explain his theories. But again on YouTube you find him being interviewed recently in Oregon, where he has moved, looking and sounding sunny and grounded and socially connected. This is an intensified and distilled Michael Ruppert, very effective but a bit misleading: he has other facets. So did Cuba, but people pulled together there, raised crops locally in every available spot of land, and soldiered through so well they're now eating better than ever."
7118,"Compared to the thin / non-existent plots in the latest blockbusters coming out of Hollywood this summer, BLOOD is almost an Oscar contender. The absolutely funny thing is, with so few actual people watching this and voting correctly, the astro turfers have managed to keep the IMDb rating artificially high. Stylistically it may look gorgeous, but you become well aware that these were employed to mask short - comings in the action sequences, directed by Corey Yuen. But the biggest culprit to bog down the film from reaching its expected potential, is the severe lack of credible villains. Indeed, there are some (two, exactly) long, outrageous fighting scenes that may generate mild excitement."
7120,"Foreboding, intriguing, smooth at times, and critically dissonant at others. On a more positive note, the film looks great and has quite a lot of moments of the surreal, often humorously so. It's a wacky, Herzogian comedy of manners, very much in the tradition of many of his films from Dwarfs through Stroszek to Grizzly Man. After scanning the scene for the basic details, Dafoe and PeÃ±a are made aware that the main suspect, Brad McCullum (Shannon) is across the street. This matches most interaction with Brad in the film, he is intense, makes no sense and his anger is often as sudden and unjustified as the moments that give him peace."
7121,"Like always, Akin creates lovely characters. You have finely structured people (with a clichÃ© here and there), who seem to have their everyday problems and find a way to live with them. All of these ingredients, including the staff of the restaurant Lucia (Anna Bederke), funky old Sokrates (Demir GÃ¶kgÃ¶l), and Lutz (Lukas Gregorowicz), blend together to produce harrowing but hilarious results. This cast manages to exude a love for life that makes the move soar above others, despite the usual at times crude jokes and situations. Soul Kitchen is Akin' highly anticipated first attempt at a genuine comedy."
7123,"The fight scenes are very well done. Tsuyoshi Ihara is the real discovery of this movie. Yes there are some cheesy lines, but that is part of the fun of these movies. If you enjoy the brutal street brawls of' Undisputed' and the choreographed martial arts of' Ong Bak' then you will DEFINITELY love this movie. The finale is a bit over the top with the dramatics, but it does the job Final Thoughts: See it for some of the terrific action scenes."
7128,It has the soul which Five Point Someone had. Madhavan and Sharman adds up with commendable performances. His looks and mannerisms as a college student was genuine and consummate. The last 30 mins were beautifully shot. To conclude 3 IDIOTS has the potential to break all records and sweep all awards.
7135,"Melissa George is excellent as usual and the cast has good performances. Still, this is an impressive effort and well worth checking out (especially if you're a fan of the two superior movies mentioned earlier - "" Momento "" and "" The Machinist ""). This is a Stephen King caliber treat, a true masterpiece in terms of originality that leaves you with no regrets or how did that happen tingles. Triangle is actually an effective, intelligent, layered horror / thriller (starring Melissa George's perfect legs). "" Triangle is a very good movie about Melissa George's perfect legs, and how they."
7136,"Carrey turns in what is possibly his best performance in a decade. The entertainment value of this picture, its expert construction and superb performances cannot be denied. Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor create, not merely a novelty but a revolution of sorts. At the Q&A, there was a fair amount of interest in the real story, and Ficarra, McVicker, and Requa were happy to oblige with further information. Much more than in "" Man On The Moon "" or "" The Truman Show "" The character allows him to be the great funny man that he is and at the same time there are layers and layers of new inedited brilliance."
7139,"The first 40 minutes of this movie are excellent. The House of the Devil is a fastidiously detailed, pitch - perfect homage to 80's horror, that adheres to genre conventions while at the same time transcending them. From start to finish, the film is littered with classic horror references. The scenery and style of the misc - en - scene throughout the film heavily mirrors that of the ideal 80s slasher such as Halloween. There is a danger to read too much into it, but there is a very real sense that this film is pitched perfectly at the divide between the sex and drugs disco party lifestyle of the Seventies and the money - obsessed, self - absorbed Eighties."
7140,"Fassbender excels as the charismatic interloper. One wonderful observation about this film is the economy of scenes. This really does work up a treat with twists turns, ups and downs and a staggering climax that adds extra spice to the picture. Each jaw - dropping new scene surprises yet seems the result of inexorable momentum. Added as an attempt to justify the rural scene of Britain, Arnold gets it spot on as everything flows with little adjustment required."
7147,"Secondly, the depths into Lisbeth's past were also revealed very well. It's an excellent whodunit - quality entertainment, moving and satisfying wrap - up to the point of tear - jerker, in spite of some plot - required gritty (raw, not for the squeamish) scenes, which were actual arcs for the next two installments to lean on and refer to. The more the intriguing story unfolds, the more you find out the secrets from Lisbeth's past â€“ it's like unpeeling an onion only to find more and more hidden underneath â€“ each additional layer building her into one of the most fascinating, multi-dimensional lead female characters for many years â€“ a role brilliantly played by Noomi Rapace. Â¨ The Girl Who Played with Fire is the second part of the Millennium trilogy from Stieg Larsson's novel which was a huge success in Sweden. The producers wanted Dolph Lundgren to play this role, but Spreitz did a decent job."
7154,"Where in B13 David Belle looked fresh and omni - competent, you can see that five years has taken its toll on his looks and his skills. This exciting flick contains nail - biting action, thrills, spectacular scenes and plot twists. The musician Da Octopuss creates a stirring, moving soundtrack fitting to frantic action. The DVD of B13 - Ultimatum is boxed with the original. If you liked the opening camera - work in B13--you get a lot more of it here as the camera swooshes around the blocks of District 13 introducing the major players in the film."
7155,"They might be crazy but the people they meet during fake presentations are sick, and they are powerful people. and this time, their leftist guerrilla tactics prove much more effective than the first time around: The cinematic presentation is more professional, the pace is much livelier, the pranks are more elaborate and there is more additional background information and emotional resonance. The two are dedicated and funny satirists and the Yes Men is a valuable movie. In other words, the Yes Men are a group of socially conscious activists who engage in pranks. Great film where two clever guys go to great lengths to show up nasty big corporations, the reaction of some representatives is truly saddening."
7164,"They have some really nice costumes. Ben Barnes is arguably a very promising actor who could've effectively played the role within a few years of performative maturity and growth. Though the production values are clearly pretty high - cinematography, costumes and sets are all pretty good - they're also uninspired and completely lacking in originality. The good news is that this is the sort of movie that disappears in a heartbeat after a quick release to DVD. In this more tolerant age, the visual beauty of male characters and settings is enough to represent this very theme Wilde presented."
7166,"The performances are great and there are some really superb visual moments too. The drive behind these three cops is equally compelling. Also worthy of note were; Will Patton as Lt. Bill Hobarts, Michael Kenneth Williams as Red, Shannon Kane as Chantel and Ellen Barkin as Agent Smith. A decent score by Marcelo Zarvos, interspersed with rap and other' street' tunes sets the tone. But where Fuqua sets himself apart, as he did to a good if not great extent on Training Day, is to imbue importance (not pretentious but just enough for serious effect) in the direction of scenes, and in casting."
7168,"It's obvious that the film draws huge benefit from its thematic values. Overall, a very well put together film which will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up at times. The night scenes are beautifully lit as well with a good balance between just enough to see what's going on and making the lighting realistic: the night scene in the pub with the lights out, for instance. This isn't an easy' first - date' film but it is a superior Brit film, one of the best for many years. The casting is wonderful and the thugs that terrify the local community are entirely believable."
7171,"Move them around in different positions? Ferrell's brother Patrick plays a Secret Service agent always standing by and Pia Glenn spoofs Condoleezza Rice. This HBO special is tasteless, lewd, crude and a barrel of laughs. Much of what Farrel says about G. W. is both shocking and true, so there is some really valuable recent history delivered in a very entertaining way. Now keep in mind, you don't have to have been very involved and alert regarding George W. Bush's eight years as president of the United States, you can still laugh your a ** off at the material presented to you by Will Ferrell's great comedic mind, because the show is not all references of his two terms in the White House."
7174,"All in all, a nice film with a bunch of dark twists to it. Overall, the film had some great humour and lots of suspenseful moments. Finally, in a tragically but necessarily brief role, Richard Dreyfuss is hilarious as a respectable Tulsa philanthropist with several shady ties to the less respectable underbelly of the community, making his few scenes shine with shrewd hilarity. The story is not as some reviewers stated dull and boring (if you expect a typical stoner film maybe you would find it slow & unfunny) the film moves at a sedate pace but never feels like it drags, the humour is often gentle or subtle. Some famous names in the bunch, and everyone delivered good performances."
7175,"It does have the dames, but they - and the film - are surprisingly three - dimensional and quaint, making the film a must - see. With a fun script and tight direction, Guitterez treats his cast pretty well and, while in their roles, they shine in their ups and downs. It's about two thirds drama, layered within outrageous situations and humor. There's a cute little satirical interview with the "" porn stars "", conducted by Joseph Gordon - Levitt. Overall, this is a movie that not only sports a few sexy looking women but also is quite entertaining bringing up a few real - life situations (mother - child relationships, adultery, responsibility, trust, truth and porn)."
7179,"Everything in Case 39 is at least very good. Renee Zellweger does a decent job in this movie. In recent years, she has created a very different image, but her performance in Case 39 feels realistic and effective. Renne Zellweger is excellent as the empathic, Emily Jenkins. The acting is adequate amongst all the principal characters, the direction choppy in places, the look of the film is beautiful."
7180,"The denizens of the deep are portrayed in a respectful and almost reverential manner. This movie has superb angles, beautiful scenes, remarkable background music, and deep - meaning little messages. Mr. Perrin surely is an outstanding director. This movie is a definite must - see for children of all ages. Undescribable movie about wonderful creatures living in the oceans and the surroundings."
7181,"A mix of Waiting meets Glengarry Glenross meets. Each character is flushed out well enough for the movie's purposes, and each gives you the right laughs at the right moments. Overall, the film has quite a few laugh - out - loud moments but is consistently entertaining all the way through, with the final act coming out as the highlight of the film. This movie works because it clicks on many levels. Indeed, it has all their hallmarks: amusing, witty, even absurd dialogue; hilarious ensemble scenes; wonderful character / cameo performances; and an incredibly funny blooper reel during the end credits."
7183,"In many ways this is the natural, and equal, follow - up to Memories of Murder. Perhaps indeed there are a few too many: the last ten minutes introduce further twists after the surprise climax that might better have been omitted. Joon - Ho Bong is one of the most exciting and wonderful storytellers coming out of Asia today. But while Bong navigates the black - comic elements well, it's his skill as a Hitchcock - cum - Chabrol idolizer that makes it a must - see. "" Madeo "" is an original and dramatic South Korean thriller that has an engaging story with a surprising plot point and many twists."
7185,"People's emotions and reaction to event and situations are quite universal. There are echoes of Antonioni's L'Aventura here but there is a big difference between the two films. Farhadi's cast is uniformly excellent, especially Farahani, who compellingly registers Sepideh's shock at how her seemingly innocent matchmaking has taken such a tragic turn, as well as the way her character, like others in the film, is revealed to not be what it initially appears. All the actors here are superb but special mention must go to Golshifteh Farahani, Shahab Hosseini and Saber Abar. That's the real charm of this film: although it's demanding in terms of familiarity with the setting, it's international in its depiction of emotions anyone from anywhere can relate to."
7186,"It actually has a bright atmosphere, like "" AmÃ©lie "". But what's refreshing, as in Jeunet at his best, is the sense of unpredictability. Jeunet proves that a great filmmaker truly is an artist as each shot is more beautiful than the next. These are all weird characters in the best Jeunet fashion. Micmacs is consistently funny and ends in a way that will leave you smiling."
7188,"Most importantly it was all thrown together beautifully, hats off to the writers and director. This was a rather enjoyable and strangely touching action caper, with moments of genuine depth and truth. What made this movie unique was the blend of genres which works really well. The story told in "" Defendor "" easily picks you up and keeps you tight. For all Defendor's silliness, it certainly packs a brutal punch when necessary."
7190,Neeson and Nesbitt should both be recognized for their riveting performances. Both sides of the coin are deftly rubbed by Hirschbiegel and his terrific cast. Both Nesbitt {ranking along side George Best as most talented thing to come out of Northern Ireland} and Neeson then shift gears to ram home the point of the story. The outstanding thing about this film that there are no sides. Guy Hibbert wrote this excruciatingly visceral screenplay and Oliver Hirschbiegel directs a first rate cast.
7195,"Nicolas Winding Refn's Valhalla Rising is one such example. There is very little dialog and everything said is important. The director sets great scenes in some awesome locations, so your eyes will be in for a treat. That being said, if judged in terms of cinematic and visual experience, it was beautifully shot, and the much vaunted fights scenes (especially the ones in the beginning) were awesome in their brutality. Nicolas Winding Refn and his skeleton film crew have done a fantastic job with this film."
7198,"It is a hypnotic trip that displays brilliant originality and borderlines pure insanity. This ensures that the kids will be there to take care of them for the rest of their lives. A life unquestioned and unexplored leads to a stagnant swamp of confusion. What if you could be the master of your own universe, able to make everything to your own specifications and liking? Still, like any human they yearn for answers and they have a certain half formed desire to be the masters of their own destinies."
7199,"While the most important parts seem to have been wrapped up smoothly, there still feels like a lot of subplots that haven't been taken care of or that maybe there was too much to take in anyway and by the end it's all blown your mind a bit. All in all, this trilogy is interesting to watch and really presents three different kinds of a movie and creates connections in between them in an interesting way. This final part supposedly wraps everything up, but hardly in a neat and tidy fashion. "" Red Riding : 1983 "" provides a fitting conclusion to a whole that is, in some ways, greater than the sum of its parts. In truth there are a few moments featuring outdoor scenes where the sun MIGHT be out amongst clouds, though camera and lighting do their best to avoid such potential charm."
7203,"Necessity of a follow - up aside, this is one of the single most brazen and memorable works of horror in many years; see it if you dare. In a few years this will be regarded as a great example of tense thrilling and yes horrific filmmaking. It'll make you sick, it'll make you turn your eyes away. One reviewer described that as stupid but it is ridiculously funny amidst the terrifying moments in the film. The true star of the film is undoubtedly Dieter Lasser, who gives a marvelously grotesque performance as the dedicated Dr. Heiter."
7227,"She is simply magnificent in her role as Dren. The work here is truly spectacular, and compliments the script wonderfully. The real marvel of the film however is undoubtedly ChanÃ©ac. The special effects and make - up are awesome, transforming the gorgeous French actress Delphine ChanÃ©ac in a creature with an exotic beauty. The creature effects were solid and the actress playing Dren is amazingly beautiful and exotic looking."
7230,"The whole film has the same setting and characters throughout, but it is never boring. And for the acting, which has some real high points. During the film rules are quickly set up, making it clear what the characters are able to do with a set of rules and not other outside rules apply. One actor, Luke Mably, really stood out though. The acting is very good and intense, with Luke Mably having the showiest role."
7238,"Gitti (Birgit Minichmayr) and Chris (Lars Eidinger) seem to have a lot of fun together. The most admirable aspect of the screenplay by Maren Ade is that it doesn't throw easy labels onto either the characters or the problems they're facing. There isn't much more to the action than that, but it's all in the details as Ade spins out one scene after another in which Eidinger and Minichmayr run through a range of emotions together. German director Ade's' Everyone Else' (or' All the Others' --' Alle Anderen') is very much a women's picture--in the very most positive sense. But when the calibration is subtle, as with Jane Austen, little matters like buying a dress or deciding what to carry on a hike become matters from which much is to be learned."
7239,"Enter John Patrick Amedori as Mikey. What really makes the picture work are the two leading women, who play their upbeat diffidence and sarcasm with wide eyes and cute smiles. Although her story is the main thread, there are numerous subplots that explore the various possibilities of the implications of such a device. Mikey is like an unruly dog who's outgrown his puppy years while retaining the innocence of youth which is undeniably appealing to Oona. Amedori wins the comedy award hands down, with the film's funniest lines and the ability to do more with inappropriate facial expressions than any dialogue could."
7260,"He also did a fantastic job bringing in the laughs. Cherrybomb is a great film for anyone who likes, drama, comedy, a bit of romance, and a burst of reality. It has some good editing and few nice soundtracks. It's fresh, exciting, and jam packed with jaw dropping moments and gut busting humour. Malachy has a heart, and he's not afraid to express his feelings right there for people to see."
7264,"It's amazing what an interesting person Jack Rebney is and how much he represents. This documentary is worth watching due to the vigor and articulate nature of the subject, Jack Rebney. Jack Rebney is a fascinating and lovable character who is extremely intelligent, honest and full of colorful dialog. Sometimes even just listening to Rebney talk is funny in its own regard. The film has comedy: Rebney is one of the great crotchety old men of all time."
7265,"This creates an enticingly magical combination of possibilities. Ifans and Little are also fantastic. There were scenes set in the year 2092 that were absolutely stunning on the big screen. The possibilities are the ones given by a 9 year old child, full of ideas, full of freedom, completely and entirely boundless. In practice, it means that this is a very non-linear experience in terms of time and space, real and imaginary, showing you results of important choices either way."
7270,"Justin Bartha finally bags a lead role and what's better than teaming up with the ever green Catherine Zeta Jones Douglas. Sets, costumes, and photography are likewise quite attractive. It makes you smile in places with some witty and amusing scenes and also imparts some wisdom about life and any relationship. A decent drama comedy and romance with unexpected dialogs - reflection of reality is a bit scary. Not only does it star two great actors, Catharine Zeta Zones and Justin Barber but there are also two amazing young kids that add to the humour and inspiration behind the story."
7273,"After - show delights from fans (including a girl trying to climb a cottage and failing) and artists (who are fans, of course), people arriving to the resort, history, gigs, snippets of Patti Smith, Sun Ra, Iggy Pop and others from different eras explaining how they feel about music are included, as well as the place in itself. But because the whole thing is made up of fan footage, as well as some camera - work by the bands themselves, it's very disjointed and jarring in places but, for the most part, it's plain impressive. Despite all footage reportedly from amateur sources the whole film and its visuals are rich in variety and quality."
7277,"The cast is good but burdened with many aspects of the bizarre that keep the viewer form connecting in a positive way. This is an original and unusual film, more thought provoking than is typical of the genre, well made with a cast that all put in quality performances. Intelligent, moving, sometimes shocking and occasionally funny this is an engrossing and enjoyable piece of work that gives food for thought as well as an entertaining ghost train of a ride. Jim's moving yet subtle performance as a disfigured and self conscious young man is totally convincing and elicits all the empathy this character warrants. Now, without the physical disfigurement Jamie attracts a pretty delivery girl Tia (ClÃ©mence PoÃ©sy) and seems to have found his wishes come true - with Tia and Charlie as family."
7279,"It was very well shot, with beautiful sets and was visually exciting, with first class editing. The little facial expressions, the subtle glances, the telling pauses, the body language. An upper middle class (or, let's face it, upper class) family of four - the Joneses, Steve, Kate, Jenn and Mick - move in to a very nice new house. everything that makes film a medium of intense impact is used to tremendous effect, all expertly guided by the emerging artistry of director Derrick Borte. It is genuine enlightenment to witness the choices made when the characters are ultimately forced to resolve the true issues they confront."
7304,"Giovanni Ribisi overacts, but here it works. It's interesting to hear what really happens in this kind of world and how people can overcome obstacles. However, there are still some good moments in the film that complement Luke Wilson's performance, even beyond the subject at hand. However, if you can get past that, you might find the movie fairly entertaining and at times hilarious, thanks to some quite original plot twists and turns. Wilson, Ribisi, Cain, Sherbedgia and the rest of the crew were well cast."
7344,"It is truly one of a kind, one of the treasures of the art world. The modern museum gives art much more space to breathe, and scholars and curators can and do illuminate art by arranging it, and juxtaposing it, in new and different ways. Just as copyrighted works eventually enter the public domain, so should artworks become available for the benefit and enjoyment of the larger public. Attorney Nick Tinari, a prior student of Dr. Barnes, who doesn't suffer fools gladly is a joy to watch; dynamic, outspoken and sharp as can be. Each generation produces new scholarship, and artworks of genuine cultural importance should be available to the finest scholars and curators of each generation."
7349,"excellent performances, good soundtrack and smooth production. It is among the finest, most enjoyable movies the genre has seen in years, and seems destined for cult status. Brent is not her first play thing as there have been many others just like him, and she is getting good at it. Because of the passion and focus she obviously brought to the role, McLeavy's portrayal transcends that of a one - note monster. The actors - first and foremost the devilish pairing of Robin McLeavy and beady eyed John Brumpton - are just terrific, as is the cinematography and the set pieces."
7352,"The visual style of the film is reminiscent of the work of Jean - Pierre Jeunet and Michel Gondry. At any rate, as with Withnail, and the comedy of duo Oram and Meeten, there's deeper stuff going here on than just a bunch of stoner - style antics. Everything is very vivid and pleasing to the eye with cartoonish colors and simplicity surrounding what ultimately ends up being a very complex story. There is much to like here, the performances of the two main characters are excellent, especially Simon Farnaby, who dresses like a 1970s binman. In conclusion, a beautifully crafted film visually, with many laugh - out - loud moments, and some endearing characters."
7371,"Four years in the making, this got Ellsberg's participation as narrator and having the final word after publishing his best seller "" Secrets "" and subsequent book tour of "" Secrets "". Featuring: Daniel Ellsberg, John Dean, Patrica Ellsberg, Bud Krogh, Tony Russo & Hendrick Smith, as well as the voices of Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger, and others involved in the dirty dealings of war. 58 , 000 American and over 2 , 000 , 000 Vietnamese lives were lost during the Vietnam War. Terrific movie, the qualities embodied by Ellsberg should be encouraged in anyone seeking public office. Judith Ehrlich & Rick Goldsmith co direct this well documented film, with testimony from those who were there, both currently still living, as well as those who have passed away over the years, from a script written by Judith Ehrlich & Michael Chandler."
7395,"Ray has had amazing success with his publicly made predictions. They all utter the same phrases, and even the naysers appear to be cheer leaders of human triumph. Once computing power surpasses the brain, then computers will design computers, and they will grow exponentially smarter. Kurzweil sees a great deal of promise in this, including the potential for immortality. Basically, the notion that machines, specifically computers, will someday soon exceed the intelligence, cognitive, perceptual, analytical, and other mental powers of humans, and become "" self - aware "" and achieve consciousness."
7397,"The visuals are breathtaking at moments. Everything is bigger and better, and it feels much more like a movie than just a collection of episodes. The reduced number and better designs have helped things along well. The interactions of the characters are becoming more believable, and individual personalities are being better exposed and explained. The animation is once again fantastic, the new battle scenes and Angel designs are impressive, and all the story / character additions and character changes are absolutely for the best."
7398,"It was simply an amazing experience, the moments captured in this documentary are priceless along with the the many unusual and interesting setting and venues that they played! The camera work, the editing, the use of black and white and other filters, all made this an absolute joy to watch. Jack & Meg, you are such cool cats! The White Stripes are minimal with a capital M. Thankfully they are also good. And, on top of the content being so strong and inviting, the way the film is shot and how the director stages the White Stripes is engaging."
7411,"It perfectly captured the breathtaking scenery and the gorgeous colourful costumes. However, all in all, the mini-series is fantastic. Everything from the acting, the costumes, storyline, and music was just so superbly done. Romola Garai is a youthful, vivacious and expressive Emma Woodhouse. Also, the setting and costumes they chose really captured the times."
7416,"Nothing gels together, nor is it particularly compelling to watch. It's an eerie watch, and does have some good moments, but it doesn't accomplish anything major. The footage and stories involving Willowbrook are skin crawlingly effective, the visits to the ruins of the place equally creepy. While the film raises many questions but provides little answers (mainly because the case displayed in the film is decades old, and was decided on circumstantial evidence), it is done really well and is painfully interesting. Most of the missing children were special needs cases, and with Rand having close ties to Willowbrook State School, a sorry place for the mentally ill thats conditions were exposed by Geraldo Rivera's infamous documentary in 1972, and his known living arrangements out in the Greenbelt Woods around Willowbrook, he seemed the likely culprit for sure."
7422,"The scenes in the real world are well done, and the cyberspace world is amazing. The film is a dazzling display of vibrant, pretty colors, computer - generated backgrounds / scenery, and lively three - dimensional characters. In conclusion, Summer Wars is OK. It all just shows the marvelous degree of attention to detail that Hosoda paid to this project. Director Mamoru Hosoda however likely said something along these lines: "" Yeah, sounds cool! """
7434,"Creepy and frightening film with fantastic events, thrills, chills, suspense and nail - biting scenes. As well as an adequate but dark cinematography by Checco Varise. In a genre that is quickly becoming based only on graphic, grotesque, shocking blood and gore sequences and predictable horror and grisly effects, this thriller is actually attractive for all the right reasons and should be enjoyed highly by those that appreciate true horror / thriller films as opposed to the blood soaked hacker / slasher movies that are being pumped out monthly. It packs a thrilling and suspenseful musical score by Javier Navarrete. In todays, "" no imagination, every bit of story must be spelled out on screen in action and with explosions "" it is often to appreciate movies that make you think, draw conclusions, actually use you imagination and remember the source."
7448,"Harlock and Thomas' film joins the growing collection of posthumous albums and features that have attempted to reclaim Hicks' image, to wonderful effect. Directed by Matt Harlock and Paul Thomas, "" American: The Bill Hicks Story "" is an excellent documentary which has the hard task of making Bill's childhood years interesting, and chartering his long, lonely years on the road. No other individual has managed to take the unpalatable truths of "" modern society "" and deliver them with the intellectual poise, sincerity and utter hilarity of Bill Hicks. The plot is fairly simple - it starts off with his early years & ends with his death from cancer. Also, it appears Bill Hicks was an incredible blues guitarist from the few audio clips played."
6783,"Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit - McPhee were outstanding. The acting of the two leads is superb. And, more importantly, the acting and chemistry between the two leads is incredible. Newcomer Kodi Smit - McPhee is just as good, and together they carry the entire film on their shoulders, and they do it effortlessly. This is probably due to the medium but Viggio Mortenson did a fabulous job as the Protagonist (the unnamed father) and his son was also great."
7276,"This is a nice as well as exciting production with a big budget, great sets and thundering battles during the Roman Empire. The bloody battles are very realistic - you get a good feel for what it might actually have been like to fight hand - to - hand in ancient times, frantic and deadly. Several action scenes are outstanding with spectacular battle images and thrilling fights. Several battles are extremely gritty, entering gory territory as blood flows. Where Marshall is more effective is in the portrayal of the Picts."
7491,"The best performances coming from Matt Dillon and Tip "" T. I. "" Harris. Takers turned out to be a decent heist movie. It follows a group of criminals who are good at what they do. If you have never seen any of these movies, you may find this somewhat entertaining. Through the whole Chris Brown chase scene it is pretty much incomprehensible what is going on."
7278,"Piranha is full of cheesy moments, and it works. Piranha 3D is a hoot, for those who know what they are getting into. And if you walk in Piranha 3D (do yourself a favour and watch it in 3D, it's definitely worth it) expecting these things, then you'll have a good time. And Richard Dreyfuss does an amusing bit at the beginning (Remember "" Jaws ""? ) And women's breasts and butts are constantly being shown on screen."
7631,"The characters, like always, are great. The characters' design is really good, like always. It all flows perfectly and really is a thank you to the fans. Definitely worth a watch if you've been following the Haruhi Suzumiya series. This is a well crafted plot where many of the past Haruhi sagas are woven into this entirely new story."
7280,"But all in all, it's mildly entertaining, it does look more expensive than it was, the cos - play - factor is bearable and some ideas in the fights are nice to see. But then with a second - rate cast of relative unknowns, it is unrealistic to expect anything more than the visual delights of "" DOA "". With fast - paced action, brief dialogues and some dazzling fight sequences, one can easily get taken away by the Tekken action, even if they are ludicrous and downright incredulous. The movie was fast - paced, overall enjoyable to watch, the main character is motivated to fight, while sadly this is found lacking with the other tekken fighters. It helps that it makes at least an effort to keep some of the story and characters from the games, while offering frequent decent, if not great, fight scenes."
7282,"If you find him to be an underrated actor, this is a feast of interesting, understated moments. The rest of the cast also made a good work, highlighting Violante Placido, Johan Leysen and Thekla Reuten. The American (2010) Like many George Clooney movies, this one is cinematically superb. There are aspects that make it one of those films that will view really well fifty years from now. What this means is he is more than an actor, he's an influence behind the scenes."
7283,"But it's darn good entertainment. jen aniston was perfect as was bateman. All the cast performed to expectations and that was very good. His interactions with the boy of six or so are terrific. And for some fun, warm laughs, if that's your thing."
7284,"Interested parties can join the mailing list and watch a potent 15 clip at www. Those in control of these Global Corporations are so morally corrupted by greed that some Governmental regulation is needed to control these rabid pillagers of the Planet. He never has to rely on talking heads or PowerPoint presentations, and even at nearly two hours, the film is positively gripping. Gasland is a very shocking and important film. Fox's intimate approach and genuine stake in the issue is "" GasLand's "" greatest asset."
7286,"Thankfully, Rodriguez, like Quentin Tarantino (who co-produced this film, but for some reason, remained uncredited) saw something in this 66 - year - old ex-convict, because Trejo makes a great lead for an action film. There is an interesting mix of the usual Rodriguez players (Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin, Jeff Fahey), really good actors (Robert De Niro), notoriously bad actors (Steven Seagal, Don Johnson), and talented players that have made some bad film choices over the last few years (Jessica Alba, Lindsay Lohan). Robert Rodriguez (whose El Mariachi started his career) is the co - writer / co-director (with Ethan Maniquis) of arguably his best production since Sin City â€” Machete. Jessica Alba, Michelle Rodriguez and Lindsay Lohan all make for good eye candy and there are some very funny moments. Two great movies from two fantastic directors with some hilarious fake trailers thrown in there for the price of one."
7287,"The chemistry between Barrymore and Long is good and the screenplay has several funny moments, but at the end of the film you realize you have already seen this movie before since it ends up being pretty predictable. "" Going the Distance "" is a romantic comedy for those that like romantic comedies. But what made it a good movie was the fact that, for all the genuine laughs, it quite simply rang true. Their timing was flawless and they were even able to make lame jokes seem funny. It's not the type of film that will have lots of complicated twists and turns, so in that context it's fairly predictable, but it's really well acted by the main characters, particularly Justin Long, Drew Barrymore and Christin Applegate."
7289,"EPIC MOVIE switches scenes every 5 minutes however this is acted like a real movie, with one story line which makes sense and follows up the whole way through, even taking some lines from the original twilight movie. The best scenes are in the trailer (who'd have thought? ) This is why "" Vampires Suck "" can be halfway appreciated. That and how gorgeous Robert Pattinson looks in his sparkles and pale makeup, and the same with Taylor Lautner in his shirtless scenes. If you must, just rent it on DVD that will inevitably come out a month after the film is released."
7290,"Make up: Character been through the' wars' covered in mud and guts, blink and perfect makeup is reapplied and hair in perfect condition. Oh, and probably the most important question of all, who in the right mind hires composers under the name' TomandAndy' to compose a movie like this? To those readers who want a good time SAVE YOUR MONEY for marvel and DC because Capcom has seriously misjudged Andersons professional integrity and ability to deliver the only thing he's achieved is proving his doubters right - he is a hack."
7291,"The story works as an engaging, fascinating character study; at the beginning of the story, Mark is a socially maladjusted reject, and even after several million' friends' and a few billion dollars later, he remains pretty much the same. Jesse Eisenberg did an amazing job playing Mark Zuckerberg. Most of all, though, it's a showcase of Sorkin's impeccable writing style and knack for writing dialogue with a very unique sound and rhythm. Stripping away his signature goofiness and neurosis, Eisenberg plays Zuckerberg as a cold, calculated and determined genius who knows what he wants, is very confident and forward - looking and will stop at nothing to get it. In the real world, what is interesting is not what happened with a girlfriend or some jock twins."
7292,"It's slick, well acted and has enough thrilling moments to keep those who seek it entertained. The entire cast are all fantastic even when given smaller roles, for example Chris Cooper and the late Pete Postlethwaite steel the scenes that they are in. Each heist was exciting to watch and gave you those Heat moments. Pete Postlewaite has some amazing dialogue and is frighteningly amazing in his role. There's no doubt that if "" The Town "" becomes a success that studios will seek out Affleck for some more high - profile projects and it will certainly be interesting to see how he handles material not rooted in Boston sub-culture."
7293,"Makes for a fun night at the movies. It is much more intelligent sophisticated than the typical pandering you hear coming out of the mouths of teenagers. "" Easy A "" is one of the best movies of the year. While she is presented as a very sharp - witted, well - grounded teenager, Olive experiences the enormous power of a reputation. told through the eyes of the smart, "" invisible "" girl."
7294,"A message for anyone (but particularly women) that sees themselves in Julia Roberts character: Get some much needed and overdue professional help with your problem. The Naples presented here seems out of the mind of someone who's never been to Naples. Also Javier Bardem is worth the price of the very expensive ticket. One time Liz made a joke, that was a nice break from the feeling of being in a lukewarm bathtub for 2Â 1/2 hours."
7295,"Acted out interviews illuminate many things and the trial itself is extremely involving to watch. The contrasts between the beautiful imagery of the poem and the scenes of the tense trial were great. All these aspects combine well and it never feels disjointed; they are nicely contrasted and offer great insights into the life of Ginsberg. It's well - done and well - acted, and no excuses are made for anything about Ginsberg or his work. The trial scenes were very powerful, and the actors that played the witnesses (namely Mary Louise - Parker and Jeff Daniels), did a really great job creating believable characters."
7296,"Comparisons are easily made to works of Sacha Baron Cohen and Christopher Guest. But if J. P. can deceive so many so easily, it is all the more a masterpiece. It is one of the best movies of the year and Phoenix's performance is probably one of the best and most interestingly inspired acting jobs as well. Of course, the sad truth is that so many fine performers have indeed self - destructed in similar fashion. After the inevitable lawsuits and box office failures, Phoenix and Affleck may disagree."
7299,"It has everything you need for success. The first twenty minutes were very promising. The scenes of the release of Gekko are well done and set up for a nice premise. Carey Mulligan and Michael Douglas in particular delivered great performances. In "" Wall Street, "" the scenes of trading and the under - handed behaviors were intense and fast."
7301,"With that being said, Guardians is an engaging and relatively intense movie from start to finish. The perfect octaves, expressions and moods were used in each line. The visual designs are awesome and the music is beautiful, it is a great story. So there is some value to the price jump between the 2D and 3D if your into that sort of thing. Legend of the Guardians is a milestone for animation and a 3D visual masterpiece."
7302,"The supporting cast have groupworked this really well and it all just gels nicely. It has good characters and decent casting, and they will grow on you easily. Keir Gilchist from "" The United States of Tara "" is nuanced and convincing in the lead role, and is backed up by a strong supporting cast led by Zach Galifianakis and Emma Roberts. Comic relief provided by the excellent Zack Galifianakis. That is, "" It's Kind of a Funny Story "" has emotional chops."
7626,"As the story builds the stakes, naturally, get higher. Rachel Weisz brings a great performance in the leading role from The Whistleblower, due to the wide range of emotions she perfectly expresses with her character. The director let the impact of the story itself, and Rachel Wiesz's fine acting, carry the movie. The Whistleblower deserves applause for bringing to light the company Democra which still carries out government contracts to this day. The specific victims were fictionalized, but the overall story of what was happening and what Rachel Wiesz's character went through are true."
7259,"On the technical side ,' Srpski Film' is very well made. The cinematography is well done and there are some nice, dark and creepy moments here. What's insane is that this movie is REALLY well made; Some very impressive camera work, disgustingly sharp and mean spirited dialogue, a believable cast and some serious nailbiter scenes. Without a doubt this is one of the most disturbing movies and the responses it has received have been polar opposites. Fear and shock are powerful emotions, and films are a safe and entertaining way of experiencing them."
7307,"The acting by Richard Jenkins and Elias Koteas was spot on and authentic, as could be expected and cannot be overlooked. From the very first frames it captivates you with every cinematic tool available. The child actors, Chloe Moretz (Kick - Ass) and Kodi Smit - McPhee (The Road) were both excellent choices. Worth mention for those who have seen the original is compared to Lina Leadersson who did an exceptional job as Eli, Chloe was responsible for both the acting and the voice, while Lina was dubbed. But then Kodi Smit McPhee has previous starring as "" the boy "" in The Road, another mature and beautiful performance."
7249,"There are some OBVIOUS usage of 3D on those scenes with very funny results. Will Arnett, Kristen Wiig, Danny R. McBride, Julie Andrews and Jermain Clement make for a worthy supporting cast. The music score is just wonderful and suits the moods of the film as they come along. Steve Carell's is SIMPLY amazing, he is funny in a very different way. This Movie is not just for kids, Adults are going to enjoy it even more."
7308,"This is an all out feel - good, rah - rah movie in the vein of "" Seabiscuit "", "" The Rookie "", "" Rudy "" and even "" Hoosiers "". This is what American filmmakers do well--a rouser with messages, big â€“ screen chases, and sentimentality for the little guy. It's one of the best sports related movies EVER and comes very highly recommended! There isn't any off - color language or scenes, and it is well acted and well made. EVery about this film is spot on."
7243,"The two Water tribe children, Katara (Nicola Peltz) and Sokka (Jackson Rathbone) are no better. So beautifully wrought is this story that the fun, action and struggles are adeptly punctuated with moving poignancy. Characters who were once powerful and spitfire (Katara) or entertainingly sarcastic (Sokka) are now bland and exist solely for the purpose of exposition. And it's an incredible primer for Eastern spiritual ideals and mythology. The scenes seem episodic and unconnected, and the film never comfortably establishes its universe, always retreading with an "" as you know "" or "" aren't you that guy who . """
7310,"Happily, Dowdle succeeds with flying colours. This movie delivered what it promised, a solid taut thriller which can keep one on the edge of the seat for the optimum 1 hour and 20 minutes of running time. The interactions between the characters in the elevator are intense and very interesting. It's engaging, keeps you guessing, and you leave feeling like you just saw a darn good movie. The bottom line is--sure, it's not the best film ever, but it is a pretty darn good one."
7311,"With well known stars such as Jamie Lee Curtis, Sigourney Weaver, Victor Garber and even Betty White you know there will be quality performances. There are a lot of laughs in those scenes. Years later, in 2010, however, she is a successful public relations executive, recently promoted to a job in New York. Actin is very strong from Kristen, Odette, Jamie and the others. Odette Yustman does better as Joanna, a character who is allowed to show high school nastiness and an apparently reformed side - there is much more shading here."
7312,"They overcome a lot of the formulae. Heigl and Duhamel are awesome, apart or together. The two leads are charming, believable and goes well together. Deitchman and Robinson's story strongly evolves. The supporting cast is also very fine, as are the settings, costumes, and camera work."
7313,"With the authentic camcorder cinematography and relatable cast of twenty - something - years - old New York guys who share the common human vice of an over-curious mind, one might also assume the film would be the long - anticipated, non-supernatural version of The Blair Witch Project or Paranormal Activity. The film centers around photographer Yaniv "" Nev "" Schulman, recorded by Ariel Schulman, and Henry Joost. Like most people, most of your excitement stemmed from the two - minute masterpiece of a preview or maybe the ambiguous two - sentence synopsis dangled in front of your noses. Some scenes are fiction, but somethings are authentic. The gradual rationing of information and the introduction and unraveling of the central mystery is surprisingly well handled."
7314,"Most of the performances are excellent. Allen is still the master of his craft, the creator of charming dra - medies. Conveyed with such fabulous performances, particularly from Gemma Jones, and as is often the case with Allen, one heck of a script, Allen creates the perfect atmosphere. But he knows how to look at the familiar material from the unusual angle by mixing masterfully humor and seriousness, light touch and insight in the right proportions to explore the desires, longings, and motivations of the characters. His target audiences want to see a clever intelligent film without being manipulated or spoon fed."
7315,"Many major players appeared on camera to their detriment. Ben Bernanke, Alan Greenspan and Timothy Geithner ignored various signs of impending doom. The production of it was crisp, clean and too the point following a well thought out introduction and ending, but you sure do end up hating capitalism by the time the ending credits start to roll. The local banks unloaded the mortgages as has become the norm in the industry. Then bring back the stringent regulation that gave the industry forty years of reasonable corporate success before Reagan era deregulation."
7333,"There is something for everyone to enjoy in Megamind. Make sure to bring someone you will enjoy being a kid with again. Megamind is also pretty even handed. Megamind truly was enjoyable to watch, all the details and small touches made it a wonderful show. The whole beginning sequence on the earlier years of Megamind works for well, packing a lot of humanity into first the few minutes."
7316,"Thankfully then, they are; Hitting that perfect ratio of realism, stereotype, flaw and likability. The production values are still better than with most high profile movies. By treating its genre trappings in an low key, almost subordinate way, it feels very real. This movie has that, with interesting protagonists. Those that do, more specifically those that make their way all the way through to the final act, will be in for a treat as the film has a handful of utterly sublime moments."
7317,"What's more, it's seamless, from the superb performances by Carey Mulligan, Keira Knightley, and Andrew Garfield, to the near perfect direction by Romanek, to its gorgeous cinematography with muted color palette, to its precise wabi - sabi production design (the beauty of worn and broken things). The film opens in the 1970's, focusing on the lives of three school children in an English private school. Romanek shows a maturity and patience behind the camera that is not only rare for young filmmakers but for veteran ones as well. One final note: Keira Knightley and Andrew Garfield are excellent in their roles, but Carey Mulligan is the standout--she shows a wisdom and weariness far beyond her years, and handles difficult emotional material with a sublime restraint that makes the whole thing work. Romanek's haunting imagery combined with some great acting acting really make this film work as a great adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro's still greater book of the same title."
7318,"Your eye was skilfully drawn to the right places by use of colour placement. And the rendering of the Hulot character with all his distinctive mannerisms is a joy to behold. Chomet has obviously spent years on this film, and it looks spectacular. See it in theaters, see it on DVD. The characters are given fluid and realistic movements, and the ambient surroundings of the city and hillsides are outstanding examples of art - direction."
7320,"More twists and tie - ins ensue and blam! The photography is great, the colours seem like over-saturated, giving everything a very intense and almost surreal aura, which is exactly what it's supposed to have. If you like films such as Donnie Darko and Southland Tales, then you will probably enjoy this one. Some great performances to be fair, but a bad film that isn't bad enough to be worth recommending. Good movie with some genuine moments that undergoes a strange transformation into ridiculousness and the paranormal."
7321,"They get creative when shooting scenes with the tire, they make the killer tire really seem to have a mind of it's own. If you'd edit this down to five minutes, you'd get a seriously hilarious short, though. Quite remarkable when the serial tire is a generic tire! Pay very close attention to every scene with the bystanders on the road and you will realize that the killer tire story is not the actual plot at all. This film will take you on a journey through an unimaginable, inexplicable, but fantastic life of a tire that goes by the name of Robert."
7322,"There is one scene in particular that showcases the raw talent Legault and Mallette have. Claude Legault (Bruno) and RÃ©my Girard (HervÃ©) did an incredible job with the acting. As a superb standout from Canada, it delivers a myriad of emotions from a plethora of angles. He did an amazing job as a man going through a smÃ¶rgÃ¥sbord of pain and mental battles. This movie hits you like a tonne of bricks and keeps you on the edge until the very end."
7323,"( The 3D definitely sold the film . ) Note the paintballs though, in amazing 3D. The set piece stunts are in bright and crisp 3D that really adds to the effect of whatever they are trying to do. This is the first film that has used 3D in a way that makes the film worth seeing in 3D. "" Jackass: Number Two "" improved upon the original with a more polished, professional look, and more elaborate and inventive stunts."
7324,"It is only 90 minutes long so it is really worth your time. It's beautifully directed and filmed by Tim Hetherington and Sebastian Junger (writer of The Perfect Storm). If you see it on DVD, don't miss the interviews shown under special features. The local Afghans' pain has no end. OK, it was covering fire more interestingly, there was a total disconnect between the military and the villagers."
7387,"As bland as TS3 is, this is incredible. But then two figures, who are kind of blobs with eyes and noses and mouths, appear as the day and night fill up their bodies? The animation is beautiful with some unique shades and colouring and the detailed backgrounds you would expect, and the music is great with the use of Rossini's William Tell. This includes casinos, butterflies, attractive women, fireflies, fireworks and many more. Still, Day & Night is a worthy addition to the Pixar group of opuses that provide some humor with whatever points they're trying to make."
7325,"The vast majority (90 %) in most schools are dedicated and diligent professionals who do the very best they can with the circumstances they have. For a detailed explanation, please read Tamin Ansary's article "" The Myth of America's Failing Schools . "" They were educated, lived in nice, clean, and well maintained apartments, and did homework with their children each night. There is no shortage of blame in this game - politicians, unions, teachers, administrators, parents and rowdy kids. This stirring documentary sends out shock - waves of injustice and even a bit of a sense of futility when it explores the state of America's public schools."
7326,"Really interesting mix of genres here - think action / comedy / romance rolled up into one. People actually took cover, helped each other and synchronized their moves. That team, if not on the surface a formidable threat, is pure cinematic gold as it consists of excellent performances by Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren. There are valid attempts at making Willis seem more normal, and these can be quite amusing. Bruce's amazing wit, Sharp action moves made it really thrilling experience."
7327,"The credits begin to roll; the final suspense and final let down. There are some genuinely creepy moments, one of the biggest being when Kristi is sitting in the kitchen and BAM (! ) The family starts to hear noises and see items fall or move on their own. The performances given by the actors are genuine and the characters are more relatable than in the first movie. Katie plays a major role, whilst Micah also makes a couple of appearances."
7328,"Instead, Hereafter deals with its subject with great integrity and subtlety. Although, despite said subtlety, it features a few moments which are, by contrast, incredibly intense and shocking (in a non-scary way). The intersection of all of their lives is what is so fascinating. As usual, Mr. Eastwood has put together a terrific score. CÃ©cile de France is really impressive, she plays her part with great dignity and empathy."
7329,"Everything here feels true to its' nature. The misty landscapes, the costumes, the filthy details, and the sets are impressive. By and large, the film works well in terms of plot and pacing. Eddie Redmayne does well in the central role of Osmund and manages to make his character's personal journey both interesting and believable, whilst Carice van Houten is also memorable in an important role during the second half of the movie. The action scenes have a good amount of tension and intensity, but the shaky camera effect can be dizzying."
7330,"The 3D was pretty poor to be honest, was way too gimmicky and just involved chunks of bone and flesh fly at you. In fact, to be perfectly fair, even people who liked the earlier Saw movies will find plenty to carp about here. Overall, the only positive thing about Saw 3D is that the franchise is finally over. The traps continue to be inventive, although some â€“ like the face trap â€“ make welcome returns. On one hand, it is without any doubt, the standout sequence of Saw 3D."
7331,"The original premiere date is November 5th. There are sporadic scenes of humour. Downey, Jr. and Galifianakis give it their best shot, and to tell the truth they're not bad. Another example of such a role being done to perfection is Jack Lemmon in The Out of Towners. Downey and Galifianakis have funny chemistry, they just play off each other perfectly."
7332,"Incredible movie, a definite must - see 9/10 stars Complementing and combining Chediak and Mantle's beautiful shots is Jon Harris's dynamic editing. But everything leading up to Aron's life - altering decision is absolutely amazing and the stuff of pure filmmaking magic. Also impressive is Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography. Seen at the Ryerson Theatre, Toronto Sept. 13 , 2010."
7334,"The lighting is brilliant, as is the staging of the dance scenes. Their performances are backed by a tight story. Portman, who has shown her acting merits before in the likes of Closer, delivers a startlingly intense and beautiful performance as Nina. It's a masterfully crafted climax that only Aronofsky could deliver. Yeah, it must be Darren Aronofsky, at it again."
7335,"She is able to create the stubborn exterior of Plame while showing her emotional side deep within. He is phenomenal in the film creating a very unique character breaking through the clichÃ©s that could have been. Watts doe a very good job with her role portrayal of hard shelled Valerie Plame. In short, this is a superbly fine drama of the lives of the people in the limelight of this political scandal, with terrific performances and strong direction worthy of a theater ticket. These kinda movies should be celebrated for their courage."
7337,"Tony Scott and Denzel Washington's latest collaboration is pretty much the definition of high concept - a runaway freight train loaded with thousands of gallons of diesel fuel, eight carriages of a highly toxic chemical and a worryingly curvy track ahead of it, versus two train operatives armed with little in the way of stopping impending disaster bar a one - car locomotive and their vivid imaginations. Rosario Dawson plays Connie Hooper, a rail control supervisor, who has got to plow through considerable BS, not only to find out what's going on with double - engine AWVR777, but also to figure out how best to deal with it, once it's determined that 777 is a fully powered runaway. Based on the real - life story of an unmanned train that went careening down the tracks in Ohio after a railroad employee failed to set the air brakes while switching tracks, this dramatization of that little incident amps up the thrills for a white - knuckle 100 - minute non-stop roller - coaster ride - just think of it as an adrenaline shot that pretty much grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go from start to finish. By portraying Frank and Will's as everyday men with real concerns over livelihood and family, Scott and "" Die Hard 4. Corporate - represented by Kevin Dunn's VP of operations - and local ground operations - represented by Rosario Dawson's rail commander - can't agree how to stop it, the former as usual weighing the options in terms of dollars and cents on the stock market."
7338,"Everything was first rate which added to the realism. A big thank you to the makers of this entertaining gem! What a great selection of professionals. The writing is outstanding and the one - liners, priceless. The second area of enjoyment was the overall effort put into the sets, art direction, sound and the other technical areas."
7339,"Things change the man quips philosophically, an intellectual much like Kiarostami perhaps. If you have seen Under The Olive Tree, Kiarostami's master piece from 1994, you might find Certified Copy to be the continuation 25 years later on a different continent. Both pertain here eventually, as abstractions of life. Kiarostami's film looks beautiful and uses it's location to great effect, without becoming a postcard travelogue. They stop in a museum before the picture of a portrait, thought for centuries to be the original, though lately discovered to have been only a perfect copy."
7340,"There are a couple of especially good moments. This film was exciting, had excellent music, was well acted and the positives FAR outweighed any negatives. The Next Three Days is a better than average thrill ride filled with equal moments of edge - of - your - seat action and true emotion that spurs the entire cast. The actors are all good with Russell Crowe especially so, and the realistically gritty sets perfectly match the film's desperate tone. Elizabeth Banks' too - good - to - be-true wholesome, sunny good looks are well used."
7341,"Ignoring their new sense of purpose (besides finding lovely lakes to vacation by) Harry risks it all to return to Godric's Hollw and is there (unwittingly) attacked by a snake. "" Deathly Hallows Part 1 "" follows the book closely, but misses out on a few interesting scenes, and then makes up a few additional scenes that are poignant and incredibly welcome. As usual, Grint gets saddled with the role of comic relief, but he also gets his chance to shine in an array of emotional scenes. The film bravely takes a lot of risks, on one hand, by veering away from what kids are probably expecting, but at the same time it'll give fans a real treat (and it might even change the minds of some of those Harry Potter haters)! Infused with a profound sense of isolation and loss, this middle stretch in the film may be tedious for some impatient viewers, but fans will be rewarded with probably the richest depiction of the relationships between the characters since the first two movies."
7342,"David Seidler's script is brilliant. Geoffrey Rush, Helena Bonham Carter, Derek Jacobi, and Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill, all turn in excellent performances. So from a historical perspective is also a feast of sorts. The contrast between George and Edward VIII is most fruitful. His undeclared needs reflected in Colin Firth's eyes are a prodigious acting feast."
7343,"The 3D is worth going to. The main characters are extremely likable. The animation is spectacular, and you would be a fool not to see it in 3D. but the songs in this movie are very good. The songs were heartfelt and meaningful, they all served a purpose, it wasn't just a nameless song thrown into the movie."
7603,"there are many quiet metaphors in this film. and it is these quiet choices that show some brilliant forethought on the part of the film - makers. The acting performances are quality all around, and it's nice to see a vibrant Hannah Murray. It's a great example of how the bad can be perceived as good and how viewers can emotionally connect with characters, who did seem ever so real. Director, Benedek Fliegauf, did a superb job at keeping the realism of the piece."
7345,"Just a wonderfully well made film with terrific performances. It's not really his fault, David O. Russell packed the film with a lot of talent. In terms of boxing films, it works. ' The Fighter' is a winner on various levels. This is the best ensemble cast of the year, , many amazing performances."
7346,"Film keeps you interested in the proceedings - and it is surprisingly well shot for a first time filmmaker--several lovely scenes of the characters outdoors here. Sidekicks Jeremy Strong and Rebecca Lawrence are virtual non-entities. And, Anna Pacquin, who is so good and fiery in True Blood, is left with little to do except be a bitch. Candice Bergen seems to be constipated with her grimaces and the sexy Swedish Malin Akerman and her thighs are the best that his film can offer. Performances are fine, but not spectacular, apologies owed to the supporting actors who don't have characters to hang a portrayal around."
7241,"Originally a great character in the first two films, her appeal here takes such a massive nosedive that, no joke, it actually becomes hard to fathom why exactly everybody around her is risking their lives for her safety. All this saga was calculated on 12 - 15 years old teenager girls, which love to watch Crap like this. , they actually had fun with the script and that's what picked up the film as well as better action scenes. The werewolves have got some excellent CGI going for them and at first glance you wouldn't be able to guess that they aren't real."
7348,"The movie does hit you with more of an emotional punch than the book does, because it compacts the idiocy into 90 minutes rather than over the course of a week to read the story. Just before the 2006 mid-term elections, Kevin Tillman published his eloquent letter, "" After Pat's Birthday "". His family emerge as heroes of another kind, working tirelessly to discover the truth of what really happened to their son and why, all the while fighting an Army and political establishment that just wanted them to stand there mute, and look sad and grateful for the cameras. Although Tillman was certainly a hero, the moments leading to his death did not involve him fighting off Taliban soldiers like the government had said, he was actually killed by friendly fire."
7499,"Pay close attention to the details in the beginning, because after a while you will see the importance of that. It is certain to receive high praise from those who enjoy psychological thrillers. Easy to watch, very clever RED or WHITE wine? The characters are simple but effective. David Hyde Pierce and Clayne Crawford give superb performances."
7350,"Winstone, Farrel, Thewlis, Friel give good performances and present interesting roles. A very well made film with some interesting performances. This film was brimming with potential, an adept cast, some stylish directing & gritty yet beautiful set locations. The movie had promise - directed by The Departed's writer William Monahan and starring an eclectic bunch of British stars Colin Farrell, Keira Knightly, Ray Winstone, David Thewlis and Anna Friel. All this is played out with some very stylish moments, such as the dialogue between Winstone & Farrel in the restaurant or the artistic but realistic way in which the environment is captured."
7351,"Earth is a rich and rare cache of resources presumably not found in many places in the vast, cold reaches of space. Awesome special effects in this one, with nice designs for the monsters and the alien ships and tech. A wonderful sense of doom pervades the whole film, with no cheap typical Hollywood miraculous escapes or happy endings. Basically the aliens and each confrontation against them are generally exciting and save the film. The actors best moments come when they convey the despair and frustration of seeing every soap - bubble of hope unavoidably popped."
7594,"The fight scenes are quite spectacular. It's beautifully made, switches visual styles, languages and mood a lot and does so convincingly. The papery textures are somehow rich and colorful, yet feel as natural as the real world after a short time watching. They are wonderfully choreographed, and the actors all play their parts in them quite naturally, with distinct styles. Watch it and enjoy the art of making movies as moving pictures."
7237,"It is a special movie, one of the best movies of all - time. They are the most respected and sought after family of Far Far Away and everyone in town loves them. In a way, SHREK FOREVER AFTER is a satisfying conclusion, if not a grand one. "" Shrek Ever After "" picks up right where "" Shrek the Third "" left off. Director Mike Mitchell has at least put Shrek right back on track, and not a moment too soon."
7354,"Both forces are hard at work in this film, but the tipping point goes in favor thanks to the leads, Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway. But the scenes between the two of them are just like a well - acted acting class - type escapades, with Jake very good and Anne always a little over the top. The absence of Anne Hathaway's character Maggie in the first segment of the film is the first suggestion that this will not be a routine paint by numbers romance and Maggie's introduction sets the scene for the complex character she successfully portrays. Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyleenhaal have good chemistry on screen and secondary characters help to bring equilibrium to a movie that other way could turn to be a little depressing. For a variety of reasons for one the chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Hathaway is in perfect form as the two worked together before (as a couple in "" Brokeback Mountain "")."
7355,"The film makes good use of its cast, and their performances are fine, and do their best to carry the film. The 3D of the film was fine, it does not detract now does it really add. "" Voyage "" is also powerful in exciting action scenes. The adventures were really great and breathtaking and should be a good way to take people's spare time. Other characters from Reepicheep the mouse, a Minotaur, and other creatures are beautiful to behold."
7356,"Dunham is very talented and there are great scenes in this movie but the rave reviews are waaaaay over the top. Despite Dunham approaching this topic with the mindset to capture this point in people's lives with a sense of authenticity. Aside from the weak screenplay, Tiny Furniture features some excellent performances as well as nifty cinematography and editing. Two years ago she graduated from Oberlin College and then floated around producing her own small - time web shows. The film begins with Aura returning from college where she created some artsy videos that made a small splash on campus."
7357,"The action scenes are exciting and even the dialogue has some charm. The visuals are simply stunning, whether that describes the beautiful European vistas, lavish homes and hotels or the lead actors, there is definitely eye candy everywhere. The Tourist stars Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp in what appears to be a very promising plot. Millions, two huge stars, a director with a reputation and a fictional sounding name, and of course, Venice! Not everything that glitters is gold."
7358,"With a couple of good twists and a sprinkle of humour thrown in the mix. The acting is great, especially Pietari's (Onni Tommila) performance is great. Particularly charming is Onni Tommila the actor playing Pietari. Very creepy in parts, but with a very enjoyable streak of black comedy, this movie is a must see. Overall, the film is enjoyable and the last five minutes is rather strange but makes sense once you see the short films."
7360,"The performances make this film worthwhile. Lily Rabe, Kristen Wiig, and Philip Baker Hall were wonderful. Dunst gives one of the best performances of her career. Yes, Ms. Dunst provides what is easily her best screen performance ever. Andrew Jarecki is better known for the well - received Capturing the Friedmans."
7361,"Carter Burwell, whose previous work for the Coens is simply sublime, gives yet another stellar score, creating just the right mood and tempo. She really is 14 and held her own with the likes of Damon, Bridges, and Brolin. As is to be expected, the film has all the classic Coen flourishes, first and foremost its use of language. Hailee plays the role of Mattie Ross and she is incredible. These two long - time Coen collaborators, as well as the costume and set designers, with whom the Coens have also worked with many times before, all deliver top - notch work and show once again just how strong the power of long - term collaboration can be."
7362,"everything a good movie should be. Anyways, the 3D worked pretty well. Jeff Bridges, after all those years since the first film is still fresh as ever. It was very awesome and thrilling with all the bass and everything. Tron: Legacy is a visual feast for your eyes and an auditory pleasure thanks to Daft Punk and Joseph Trapanese."
7363,"Rather they are more likely to look like someone you know. Rut Sheen's role as Gerri is superb. The film is nicely segmented into chapters, following the seasons. and film goers are the benefactors of his daring. Graduates Tom and Gerri (pun intended) have fulfilling careers, heartfelt love for one another, high incomes, and have had the opportunity to travel widely."
7364,"This is a worthy addition to the very short list of great romantic comedies, and one which will grow in reputation through the years. James L. Brooks has a skilled and expert hand with pace and performance, and the movie is funny and unusually thoughtful--too thoughtful, perhaps, for some of the ADD - afflicted people who post here. The cameo by Shalhoub as a psychiatrist was hilarious. Moving on, as said above, this is not a movie to make you lol or rofl, merely a movie to be enjoyed from watching these character's journey of self - revelation's throughout. All the great actors just make this movie even easier to fall in love with."
7365,"Barney's ability to mess up his relationships is impressive. And, remembering "" Sideways, "" there is nobody who can play a guy half - in - the - bag nearly as well. The scenes are high - quality and well designed. The odd and intimate details of each character are still here (more so from the principal cast than the supporting players), as is the snappy and hilarious dialogue. Barney is a non-charismatic character but the performances are top - notch and watching this film is worthwhile."
7366,"Bottom line: Solid entertainment with very few explosions. though his millions of dollars of shares increase in value, thank goodness. Kevin Costner, Maria Bello, and Rosemarie DeWitt also play pivotal roles in the film and do superior jobs at being enrapturing and authentic. Despite a few dumbed down bits, The Company Men, comes with a feeling of authenticity with some heart and decent performances from everybody. Ben Affleck, Tommy Lee Jones and Chris Cooper give strong performances as the company men; the rest of the cast, which includes Craig T. Nelson and Maria Bello, are excellent too."
7236,"This effect was heightened by some excellent performances; especially from Jennifer Lawrence and John Hawkes (Teardrop). The film is well directed by Debra Granik and is easily her best work yet. In those moments, they are somehow able to employ a level of courage, perseverance, and high intention that they never knew they had. Debra Granik does an amazing job in the director / screenwriter role. Yet The Winter's Bone is a rich, satisfying film that more than deserves the accolades it has been receiving."
7368,"The direction, performances, cinematography, camera work, locations, resuming, everything is top - notch in this film. They compliment each other very well, and play off of each others strengths effectively. Byung - hun Lee as Kim and Min - sik Choi as Kang, are brilliantly cast and bring an energy to the screen that is maintained through the 144 minutes of the uncut edit. The cinematography is gorgeous, the action is hypnotic and the murders are savage and unrelenting. There are easily twenty minutes that could be chopped right out of the film, and none of its edge would be lost in the process."
7369,"The positive: Some fresh jokes, Good acting, Laughs are guaranteed. Back in 2000, Meet The Parents was looked upon as one of the funniest movies ever. It's several years later and Greg and Pam Focker (Ben Stiller and Teri Polo) live in Chicago with their twins, Henry and Samantha. Contrivances and predictable story lines litter "" Fockers "" and damper the occasional moments of humor. The gangs all here again to perform a series of unfunny sketches unfunnily and leave the audience paralysed with laughter."
7370,"Gulliver's Travels is fun, a fantasy, not taking itself seriously light comedy. That simple thing delivers the best moments of the movie: Gulliver making the Lilliputians act Stars Wars and Titanic and perform as KISS. Gaining their trust he is soon the rage of the land improving infrastructure and counseling the lovelorn. And there's also a nice scene in a theater that includes some funny spoofs on famous 20th Century Fox movies like Empire Strikes Back and Titanic. Some of the fun scenes with the tiny Lilliputians really work."
7556,"The thoughts, anxieties and pressures are all there. This movie, unlike most, treats its characters like real people living real lives. The cast is populated with mostly real teens and non actors, giving it a very real and authentic look. It goes from warm, joyous, and simple with its pallet of vibrant colors, to cold, dreary, and a pessimistic tone with its darker pallet as time goes on. Mitchell demonstrates a strong understanding of adolescent emotions and desires that brings credibility to the material, and it reeks with a strong sense of nostalgia."
7372,"All the participants turn in great performances. In spite of the negatives it's still entertaining. You can't take your eyes off of her; and not just because she's remarkably beautiful. It set out to be a fun romp with some sexy outfits and entertaining song numbers and it delivered. In short, this film is well worth watching just for Aguilara's screen time."
7374,"It just seemed to get everything pretty much right. And these images and sounds were combined together into a simple narrative that had an enormous amount of heart to it. What is easily one of the standout points of the movie was how incredibly immersive the tiny world of the Borrowers was. So many magical scenes like this made up the entire movie, but that was perhaps the best of them all. First time director Yonebayashi shows that Ghibli has much more life and talent to give."
7375,"The acting is excellent, the story is awesome, the special f / x are spectacular, everything about this movie is just Awesome! These qualities are given life by an above average cast that includes the lovely Katrina Bowden from NBC's 30 Rock. The fact however is that the way they are produced in the scenes and how the actors react just make each scene perfect. How can a brilliant movie like this not make it to the big screen, yet movies like Season of the witch, Skyline, and Gulliver's Travels do. The crowd in the cinema went totally crazy about this film, they applauded and cheered throughout the film and after the first positive reviews by bloggers the screenings in Munich for example were sold out in just three hours after starting the pre-selling."
7376,"Photography and scenes are also very fresh and so is the cast performance. Go out and see it when it premieres in theaters on December 17th. It has a ton of action scenes and is hilarious! The are friends and enemies at the same time. So, please, people that come to criticize, please, go find a movie where you find something interesting for yourselves."
7377,"eventually brought the Ford motor company to it's knees Many laughed at the women's actions Sally Hawkins is a revelation as Rita who becomes the striking machinists' spokeswoman; her speeches to co-workers, union chiefs, management and the press all start out tremulous and gain in confidence as she hits her stride. There is not one bum note in any of the performances â€“ from Kenneth Cranham's sleazily compromised Union official, to Rosamund Pike's surprisingly moving posh wife, to Jamie Winstone's wannabe model â€“ everybody has a committed credibility without ever being worthy or cloying and Sally Hawkins (with a startling look of the young Rita Tushingham) plays a richly layered blinder in the central role. A sparkling performance from Sally Hawkins as Rita the leader of the group is complemented by excellent performances from the whole cast including Bob Hoskins, Geraldine James and Jaime Winstone. As well as Sally Hawkins, there are some strong performances by other members of the cast â€“ specifically, Bob Hoskins as Albert, Miranda Richardson as an exuberant Barbra Castle, the lovely Rosamund Pike as Lisa, Geraldine James as Connie, Kenneth Cranham as Monty (Unions) and Richard Schiff as Robert Tooley (Ford)."
7379,"Using archive footage, recordings and recollections from the great and good this extra long portrait is long overdue and rightly deserved. Thanks for showing the good and bad, the ups and downs, and for uncovering that amazing BBC footage. The number of high profile contributors is evidence itself of the scope of influence of Harry Nilsson. Particularly interesting was the recording studio footage and old movies of him performing. It is a whimsical but honest look at one of the all - time great raconteurs, a fellow traveler with a coterie of out - sized personalities who largely burned brightly but briefly."
7234,"One of the most enlightening, and in some ways off - putting, scenes in the film is when she gets heckled at a show in rural Wisconsin. The crowd was paying for funny, not maudlin, and so Joan delivered, despite reservations afterward. For someone so presumably consumed with her looks, this is a surprising image that tells you this film is going to show you the real Rivers. In many ways, Rivers has carved out for herself a remarkable legacy and yet all she can focus on are the rejections and the fragile state of her acting career. With her comedic talents blending with her sad emotions, Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work is a snub that the Academy missed out on."
7382,"these kind of movies are much more enjoyable specially on the big screen. Indeed the human element is one of the films strongest suites. It is stylish, theatrical when the dramatic content demands it, beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, terrific story telling, great action pieces, and, most importantly, entertaining. And, because the settings and cinematography are so brilliant, you are treated to a cartoon like outline to emphasise every little detail you are watching. But, the real winners in here are the cinematography, photography, music, and exceptional sword and knife choreography."
7233,"The technical aspects are again flawless. It has the laughs, magic and best of all the entertainment. And it was a hit, ensuring 3d animation a place right alongside (more or less) 2d animation. It keeps both children and adults entertained. Like any spectacular trilogy, it wraps up all loose ends."
7385,"Like the other three releases before this, it pretty much veers off this theme for a lot of the show, but the humour is still fairly consistent in it's style and delivery through out. Gervais started his career playing versions of himself and characters that are perceived as annoying bastards, he does continue this persona on stage, and it works fantastically well, this is a terrific funny show. Ricky Gervais was number 49 on The Comedians' Comedian, he was number 18 on Britain's Favourite Comedian, and he was number 11 on 100 Greatest Stand - Ups. Animals is very good, Politics is alright, and Fame is good, this was the fourth stand - up show for the successful writer and star of great shows and films, such as The Office, Extras, The Invention of Lying, The Ricky Gervais Show and Derek. Irrational, over-optimistic idealism is found in equal amounts in religions and Socialism; both are equally guilty of dismissing truths (i. e. science) in favour of whatever hallucinogenic scenario their wishful thinking imposes on them."
7232,"Because the truth is that The A-Team is fun. It's a crafty plan to lower your expectations. be careful, Carnahan), and excellent with a few brief poor bits. The action scenes (as obvious from the trailers) are pretty big and impressive which is normal by today's standards. The A-Team, against all odds, is one extremely entertaining film."
7388,"Marwencol is definitely an interesting place. Which is a strong credit to director Jeff Malmberg. Mark Hogancamp is a sympathetic and interesting guy. It is hard to really describe what makes' Marwencol' really special. Given Mark's attention to detail and his skills as a photographer, it's no wonder art galleries come calling."
7231,"It's well directed by Jimmy Hayward and the lighting compliments the atmosphere, especially in the night time scenes. Megan Foxes' role is small, and she serves every purpose, much like a smoking hot Bond girl. To it's credit it had great sets, location and make up with a competently written script and a great score taking it's queue from Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) and is reminiscent of many great westerns. 58/100 You'll like it if you liked: Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer, Brotherhood of the Wolf, and Timecop. there's plenty of room in theatres for a fun out for revenge Western."
7391,"Here is what happens in every lets say 25 minutes : 1. A lot of the restaurant scenes are held for a very long time, which means that the decision to improvise is a smart one. They can milk the gags for as long as they can, which also makes them funnier. The Trip, the television program, is a poignant, rambling, beautiful little series, starring comedians Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon as fictionalized versions of themselves. But their incompetence is hysterically funny because they try to sound smarter and cleverer than they actually are, especially when outdoing each other's impersonations."
7393,"However, these kinds of mature topics and deliberate presentation are out of favor in Hollywood and unpopular with contemporary film audiences. In Lee Chang - dong's latest film Poetry, winner of the award for Best Screenplay at the Cannes Film Festival, a young girl commits suicide after being repeatedly raped by a group of juveniles. Hopefully this will inspire a perhaps much needed poetic view of this hypermodern world which can barely watch deliberate thoughtful meaningful measured movies like this, much less find and read a poem. In a larger way, "" Poetry "" is about contemporary life in Korea, and the interactions of ordinary people in extreme situations will be revealing to many outside of Korea. Mija (brilliantly portrayed by Jeon - hie Yun in what seems to be her first performance in a number of years) is a poor, elderly woman who is trying to raise her much - troubled grandson."
7229,"The Wayans brothers just imitated the same exact jokes and didn't really add anything humorous at all and they also did a much worse job; so much to the effect that it wasn't funny anymore. Spoof movies generally make fun of serious movies, generally horrors. If you like movies such as scary movie 4, meet the Spartans, epic movie, or date movie you MIGHT find this movie amusing, otherwise do not waste your time."
7530,"Some sections are more interesting than others. All great subjects that are handled with kid gloves. Still, there are lots of interesting parts to this documentary. All the colorful imagery doesn't bring anything new to the table. Freakonomics the movie is worth watching for two reasons."
7396,"And it was also a fun show, with a good amount of laughs and enjoyment. It turned out that "" Wishful Drinking "" was a nice show on a couple of different levels. Ms. Fisher, an intelligent woman, has put together a fun show in which she interacts with her audiences in ways that endears her to the people that come to see her. Her illustration of the people in her life on a big board, and how everyone is related, is one of the best segments in the show. The 1 - 2 punch of Carrie Fisher's and Debbie Reynolds' deaths was a fitting, but tragic, end to a year unprecedented in the number of famous / recognizable people who passed on."
7529,"years and heartwarming to see with so much respect amongst his peers. The man is over 80 years old and his eye and mind still quickly process what he deems worthy of notice. the fascinating "" Duchesss of Carnegie "", Editta Sherman. Yes, as the film takes place, he is among the last of the remaining residents of the great hall. He is such an enigmatic and joyous character that one can only believe his is greatly fulfilled by life, and only wrongly assume, he is missing out on anything."
7527,"The Debt's first hour is quite good with adept flow from 1997 to 1966 and the truly suspenseful scenes between Chastain and Christensen. The pacing is steady and there's a lot of intensity as the agents attempt to accomplish their mission. Helen Mirren and Jessica Chastain as the young Rachel were so good. This is partly due to the fact that Rachel (Jessica Chastain) gives the most impressive performance in the film and is someone who immediately involves you in the story. Jessica Chastain continues her fantastic 2011 season adding this performance to her more spectacular turns in "" Tree of Life "" and "" The Help ""."
7228,"The scenery, naturally, is dazzling and so are the costumes and cinematography. One knows immediately everything that will happen and how it will end. She has a great range of endearing expressions. Amanda Seyfried is on a roll, her lovely awareness of roles will propel her into super stardom. Other than being very lovely shoulders, she did an excellent job of portraying her character."
7226,"Within hours of the procedure, Zoe meets Stan (Alex O'Loughlin) an attractive and charming man who has caught her eye. All the funny moments are already shown in the trailer. The chemistry between O'Loughlin and Lopez is professional and solid, If nothing memorable. Jennifer Lopez and Alex O'Loughlin had very good "" couple chemistry "" as the relationship developed. This is a movie that would be best seen when it comes out in DVD; however, if you want to see Jennifer and Alex on the big screen, go ahead."
7225,"The cast all do a fine job with their parts and the direction is very good. Especially with the likes of the SAW films out there! Samuel L. Jackson was very "" deep "" in this movie and his acting was excellent. Yes the film has some brutal scenes but it's all part and parcel to draw you in. Moss is strong as the movie's moral center--a center that shows some very serious signs of disintegrating."
7223,"The rest of the women's' problems' were no better. Predictably, they get home and everyone is as introspective as they're capable of (not very much at all), and they realize how wonderful their lives really are (no they don't). There are some humorous scenes by Carrie and Big, but with a big name like Sex and the City, it should've been extraordinary and have been on many critics "" Best of the year "" list. The preview for the new Rachel McAdams film that came on right before it. The funny thing about that is how they all have impossibly great lives, especially by NYC standards."
7221,"It's how each deals with his or her issue that makes things interesting in life. But a natural striving to consciousness takes hold because they're all just open enough to admit they don't have all the answers. What's most positive and enjoyable about the film is the desire of its characters to deal with their problems even when they're not aware they're doing it. OK, that is a slight simplification, but it is an extremely well written story that showcases the imperfections of people, social situations and society as a whole. Watching them on a path that ineluctably carries them to self - awareness, and then each other, is one of the great movie pleasures of this year."
7404,"There is a genuine purity about the feelings, some of which are extremely sexually explicit. The shots of the Volga are beautiful. The main theme in their life is a large river that flows through their country and that is more or less the base of their lives. The story is amazing, the way they go through it is maddening and reminding of a lot of other strange road trips. It is one of the most poetic films ever made and ten stars are not enough."
7219,The sets and visual effects are excellent. A fun night at the movies! Producer Jerry Bruckheimer has again delivered a very entertaining summer blockbuster. The parkour sequences are definitely of the highest order and very well - edited and photographed. Everything from the cinematography of the desert landscapes to the city of Alamut and the beautiful sets are a real treat to look at.
7217,"Katherine Heigl does comedy well, and is always pleasing to look at, and there is a bit of -' ow you say? The chemistry between the leads is great and, as a couple, the characters match well enough for the audience to engage with them. However, it is surprisingly Ashton Kutcher who provides the warm heart of the film. The shining light of Heigl's career so far was Judd Apatow's Knocked Up, which seemed to set up a potentially promising career. Kutcher is detail - oriented twitterer, and as an actor, his goofiness is unmatched."
7216,"everything about it is incredibly inspired and brave and poetic. Gossling and Williams are both superb in this film. What's genius about Cianfrance's story is that the dialogue doesn't hold any type of pretense to it. Director and co-writer Derek Cianfrance does a tremendous job with the details and creating the personalities of these two people. It's heartbreaking, it's deeply moving; it will have you laughing, crying and singing its praises."
7215,"The early 70s was brought to live with amazing detail. Great casting with superb performances from the central few characters and again a stunning turn from Ralph Fiennes. impossibly tame and in fact cloyingly wholesome, the components of Heartbeat. It was nostalgic of the 70's and the music was fabulous! Since the creation of The Office and Extras Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant have been recognised as two of Britain's most well known comedic talents."
7408,"The sets and cinematography were spot on and very believable. They work very well together, and both give entertaining performances in the process. It's witty, well shot, got great performances and it has Ronnie Corbett! Simon Pegg and Andy Serkis are a well - matched double act. Some cringeworthy gross bits, but an all round a romp of a good film."
7214,"Von sydow is a pleasure to see as usual, and both Crowe and Cate Blanchett delivers. And the first signs are indeed good, starting as an origin story that traces Robin's steps returning from the Crusades and arriving in Nottingham. He's done better work, such as LA Confidential, which had both characters and plot. This movie had a lot of potential, but it's thrown away on hasted parts and plain stupid scenes."
7526,"Ostensibly the story of the main male character, a young - ish boy called Martin, the movie follows his travels with the enigmatic "" Mister "", who is an experienced vampire killer. The acting was generally very good, the sets first class and the story went at a nice steady pace with just the right amount of horror thrown in to keep you on your toes. This movie owes more to the likes of "" The Road "" than it does Zombieland. The film is most memorable for its details of life after the vampires take over. Also, you will learn many important tips for surviving the coming zombie / alien / vampire apocalypse."
7212,"Fieger is a colourful, over-the-top character in real life, perfectly suited to Huston's strengths. There are powerful performance in abundance, not least from the underrated Danny Huston who plays Fieger, Kevorkian's larger - than - life attorney. But with an outstandingly intelligent script, first - class cinematography and stellar performances by all the actors it becomes compelling viewing. Al Pacino, who bears an astonish resemblance, plays Dr. Jack Kevorkian and does an incredible job. What's interesting, though, is the focus on Pacino's eyes during the scene where he performs his first procedure."
7209,"As a comedy it succeeded beyond expectations. James Gill ------ Find more reviews, news and previews at www. There were elements of overacted screwball comedy; there were underplayed facial expressions and reactions that added a wealth of character and personality to the comedy; further still, there were elaborately constructed situational set pieces. Part of the pleasure surely came from the spectacle of the event; a sold out screening with cast and crew present along with regional cultural references that resonated infectiously with many in the audience, but this can take nothing away from the many levels of comedy at work within this film. In the UK, Chris Morris is famous for the very controversial "" Brasseye "" series, and he has taken that iconoclastic attitude to the big screen to help create this wonderful little film."
7414,"Some may find it frustrating but it just added to CONFESSIONS's charm and wit. As the story is unfolded, there are several surprising twists. Kokuhaku (or Confessions) is a real winner from Japan. The director extracts brilliant performances from the entire cast. A surprise box office hit in Japan ,' Confessions' made its way to the Toronto International Film Festival, and also chosen as Japan's entry to the Oscars."
7208,"Everything about it is decent, but nothing great. Gallner single - handedly makes the final act interesting, since you'll have wanted every other character dead from the opening minutes. In fact, fans of the original will note several virtually - identical scenes, all of them done on a higher budget but without a whit of artistry. When it was announced that Jackie Earle Haley would be taking on the role of Freddy in the new Elm Street franchise reboot, a collective sigh of relief went up from the fans of the originals. The highlight of each film was the creativity of the different "" Dream Worlds "" that Freddy would take his victims to."
7224,"Sean Combs delivers one of the funniest performances and Colm Meaney of "" Con Air "" isn't far behind him as Aldous' father Jonathan Snow. Another standout is Sean Combs as an over-the-top music exec. This is just 108 minutes (approx) of pure fun and a lot of crude humor. Sure, there are some pretty lame gags, but these are fairly rare. Everything about it is larger than life, yet believable."
7525,"The lengths this gentleman was put to was intense. He is amazingly good for someone that young. All in all, Hesher is a great film that is at the same time both hilarious and moving. Not so much in anger, but in freedom, and having fun at the expense of a few' versatile solutions for modern living'. A wonderfully touching performance by an actor known mainly as a doofus on a TV show."
7206,"----------------- Take note, ladies and gentlemen. Robert Downey, Jr., as always, is effortlessly captivating. Gwyeneth Paltrow, as Pepper Potts, has a comes more to the forefront in the sequel. At least the action is satisfying high octane eye candy as Jon Favreau's steady directing hand brings out the intensity of every battle scene. Scarlett Johansson also showed up with some impressive stunt work, along with her always gorgeous looks."
7205,"It's a hoax, it has to be, it's too hilariously perfect to be anything but. Guetta's point - of - view is absolutely authentic in the way it synthesizes and skewers popular culture. It's perfectly designed and pitched to be enjoyable on multiple levels: on one as an entertaining, illuminating mini-history of "" street art "" and on another - one entirely more convoluted and entertaining - as a light - hearted "" up yours "" to both street artists and their patrons. What separates him from Banksy, and it's most likely what makes this such a great documentary, is the method of hype. Despite being directed by a street artist and evidently put together from thousands of different tapes, Exit Through the Gift Shop is amazingly well directed."
7202,"The film - making is solidly competent, the scenes are clearly--perhaps too clearly--written; the cast is fine. Reilly gives one of his best performances and Jonah Hill has easily his best here. What might be the Duplass trademark is the way they bring out real honesty in the performances by all three stars. In subject and style, it imports many of the characteristics of traditional mumblecore--offbeat humor, improvised feel, bare bones production values--wholesale. Jonah Hill, of' Knocked Up' and' Superbad ,' as well as the current' Get Him to the Greek ,' is a mainstay of the Apatow stable."
7201,"They took out the best scenes. The plot lines showed major attention to detail, and the twists and turns that this writer takes you on are so convincing. At best, the closest Ronnie ever came to resembling a character from one of your previous features was Diane Keaton's daughter from Nights in Rodanthe (pauses) Ohhh! However, hats off to Kinnear for an honest performance. The book was amazing: funny, romantic, sad, cheerful, pretty much everything you could want in a book."
7200,"So for an early blockbuster, The Losers delivers about what you'd expect. The Losers can definitely be a contender against The A-Team. Some great locations, good editing (also nice marriage of comic book style to live action style in the credits), decent soundtrack. if you want an entertaining "" don't need to think about it flick "", The Losers generously provides. Will someone please put Jeffrey Dean Morgan in more intelligent dark humor action leads?"
7522,"Great performances of Darin and Gusman. And on top of everything, the wheel that makes this world spin, is the boldness and visual power with which this is made. Trapero is a top - notch scriptwriter and director. They are so human and common that they can do the movie perfectly credible, 'cause, everything (except the love history) is a every day real situations. Notwithstanding the emotional anxiety or even repulsion that the story itself and some scenes may convey, this is a phenomenal work of art film, cinematography, acting, direction, design and clothing."
7298,"This is a coming of age film set initially and briefly in the late 1950s and mostly in the early 1960s. "" Flipped "" has all of the comedy, naivetÃ© and bewilderment of first love. There's no doubt about it that Flipped will make you say "" aww "" on occasion, but there's a lot more to it than just kids being cute. Except in the case of middle - school graders, that love and respect can frequently look like embarrassment, mistrust, and shame. Juli herself flips for Bryce Loski, who is at first repelled by Juli and then slowly starts to see her for the lovely person she is."
7196,"It was also fun to watch him as, at times, he has these great facial expressions. Overall, It was enjoyable for the whole family including adults, teenagers and of course the children. This is a very entertaining movie that can be enjoyed by adults as well as kids. Some really fantastic performances from these child actors and a storyline everyone can relate to. Chloe Moretz has a wonderful role herself in the movie however her appearance is short."
7427,"- Well Werner makes sure you see those sorts of moments. The picture starts with some really beautiful shots of the French vinyards and mountains near the cave. They remark how fresh all of the art looks, and it's preservation and immediacy is truly astounding to reflect on over the course of the film. The cave was apparently sealed by a landslide many millennia ago which has preserved everything perfectly. It contains perhaps the most extraordinary array of cave paintings dated from between 23 , 000 to 30 , 000 years ago as well as extraordinary calcite formations, stalagmites / stalactites and ancient bones of creatures long migrated from the continent."
7194,"an amazing talent as seen briefly on television's Eli Stone, was used minimally and not to her full potential. ' Unnecessary' is probably the best single word description of Neil LaBute's "" Death at a Funeral . "" This movie tries to live up to the original English comedy, but despite the brilliant actors like Glover and David, it doesn't succeed. Martin Lawrence, Danny Glover, Tracey Morgan, Zoe Saldana, Peter Dinklage, Luke Wilson, and others comprise an undeniably talented cast that does an admirable job performing characters that were written as upper - crust Englishmen, but watching Rock sulk his way through the film makes it abundantly clear that they're not being themselves. On that level, there's a creative integrity to the original performances that is impossible in LaBute's version."
7193,"All in all, The Runaways is a fantastic movie. You can't help but be impressed by their performances, they play and act like a real band. Musician finds sudden professional and personal fulfillment and everything is rosy. It's fine though because the performances are strong enough that it's easy to forget that the material's nothing new. Between Jett's earsplitting rhythms and Ford's virtuoso lead."
7430,"Whereas' Kick - Ass' longed to be gritty and satanic in its approach, it only appeared so through the hazy goggles of Hollywood, never fully commanding the realistic ambiance that sits so gracefully at the centre of' SUPER'. Gunn's unique and devoutly crooked approach is so confident and gracious in its presentation, every - shot though tremendously rough, settles calmly into the film, reflecting Darbo's genuine feelings that he's not actually doing anything wrong. Liv Tyler drifts sweetly and innocently into the backdrop of Frank's crusade as his angelic wife Sarah, but the show - stealing Ellen Page dives straight in front as the sadistically adorable Libby, later becoming Darbo's sidekick Boltie. Even the cameos from the likes of' Slither' star Nathan Fillion (among others) are marvellously acted and well placed, providing constant hilarity for Gunn fans and others alike. As actors, both D'Arbo and Page are scary, funny and insane."
7191,"Tina Fey + Steve Carell = A funny and surprisingly heartwarming film. Steve Carrel & Tina Fey are great comics on TV. Except for a few scenes, this movie isn't anything innovative; but it's still nice to see Steve and Tina play likable characters. For the Fosters Phil (Steve Carell) and Claire (Tina Fey), such is their married life, with spontaneity and energy being sucked so dry, even their regular date nights seem like a chore. The reason this film works is not the plot or script, but rather the talents of the two funniest people in showbiz today: Steve Carell and Tina Fey."
7189,"And Christopher Mintz - Plasse did a very great job at portraying that type of character. Kick - Ass is that rarest of films, a successful hybrid of two genres that delivers an almost perfect cinematic experience. Christopher Mintz - Plasse (a. k. a. "" McLovin' "") especially stands out, in a role that sneakily grows into one of the most important and poignant of the film. It was definitely something different than' McLovin' and much more of an interesting character brought to the table! Chloe Moretz is an amazing actress and she seems like she has a very bright future ahead of her."
7187,"But yes, the action sequences are really great, and the scenes with Medusa and the Kraken are awesome. Gemma Arterton (as Io), however, proves to be the most successful female character in the movie. The fight with her proved to be the most interesting of the many fights in the film. Neeson's Zeus aside, none of the performances truly stand out, but they're nothing cringe - worthy either. Like the original, the other Gods do not have much to do."
7520,"Phenomenal casting is just one the great aspects of "" The Conspirator "". The cast is riveting, with breathtakingly well - done small and large parts. As far as performances go, James McAvoy and Robin Wright were outstanding. Robin Wright delivers one of the best performances of her career, in a role that seemed tailor - made for her. Robin Wright and James McAvoy do an amazing job in portraying real, complicated human beings."
7184,"This is a huge accomplishment for DreamWorks Animation, it might actually be its Best Animated Feauture it yet. First, the 3D (Odeon digital in this screening) is moving more toward the subtle with fewer "" gratuitous "" 3D moments than in movies like Bolt and Coraline. HTTYD is the latest in a run of animated 3D films to hit the family market. Joining Butler and Baruchel, both of whom give excellent performances (with Butler recapturing some of his 300 mojo), are the likes of Craig Fergusson as the Viking blacksmith, America Ferrera as the feisty object of Hiccup's affections and a whole slice of the Apatow gang including Kristen Wiig, Christopher Mintz - Plasse and Jonah Hill as other young warriors. Fights are incredible, and always accompanied either by humour that worked without the feeling that it was deliberate nor just tried too hard, coupled with the comedic voice talents such as Jonah Hill and Christopher Mintz - Plasse."
7182,"Coming from a bunch of 40 year olds, that was very entertaining. The characters quickly establish themselves as' assholes' and if you can get over the initial nauseating feeling, you are in for a fun ride. John Cusack and Craig Robinson also had very hilarious moments in this film. While the world was still recovering from the over-hyped Todd Phillips movie a smaller, quieter, but funnier movie slipped into cinemas and made a little splash. John Cusack played the' serious' dramatic / comedic role and Clark Duke has his moments while helping to aim the whole package toward a younger demographic."
7437,"On the big screen the onboard cameras add tension and gives a true sensation of speed. One of those inspirational films that stays in your head after you see it, leaves an impact, and then leaves an even bigger impact when you remember that everything you saw really did happen. This brings back memory s of late night highlight shows of a race that happened hours before. Nevertheless, Its a true Masterpiece which portrays the subtle sadness of a legend's demise in a sweet throat stifling moments. To relive the moments of Ayrton (the idol) in this emotionally gripping documentary was unbelievably comforting."
7177,"One sequence in particular is a direct copy of an action sequence in Oldboy (2003). the story was good with great action scenes and at times just plain brutal. The reference is just thrown in there to sound smart, to seem thoughtful, when the film is anything but. Remy (Jude Law, CLOSER) and Jake (Forest Whitaker, WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE) are two of these Repo Men and they're very good at their jobs. Fresh off a turn as Watson in Guy Ritchie's superb Sherlock Holmes, Law plays Remy, who work for the The Union, a company that supplies artificial body parts."
7439,"This film is packed with tons of really creepy and disturbing images. Of all the many positive aspects of' Insidious ,' however, perhaps the most attractive is the simplest: It's actually pretty damn scary. Some scenes were creepy and the mixing of music and sounds were done superbly to add to the Horror. Insidious has a lot of really intense moments that scare, and then grab hold of you. And maybe bring a Xanax as well."
7173,"It has some fun moments, though familiar, and it will not seem a total waste of time. All of the cute stuff (and pretty much the only cute stuff) was contained in those previews. Most everything you see, you've seen before--just done better somewhere else--and all of it combined into something very hodgepodge. Comedies are one of the luckiest genres in cinema. For all that, there's something likable about it, and that's probably Jennifer Aniston, even if she's delivering the same thing she's delivered in every other film she's ever been in."
7172,"Some scenes work better than others. Predicaments predictably follow, in the proper order and to factory specifications. The young leads are a charming, believable couple, and you do root for them. The best parts of the movie were the story with Forest Whitaker and Regina King, and anything with Charlie Murphy, who has a small but hilarious role. Plot has ultra-wealthy Marcus (Lance Gross, part of the Tyler Perry's "" House of Payne "" clan), son of Brad Boyd (Forrest Whittaker, Oscar - winner for "" Last King Of Scotland ""), who falls in love with Lucia Ramirez (America Ferrera, "" Ugly Betty ""), the salt - of - the - earth daughter of a tow - truck driver, Miguel (stand - up comedian Carlos Mencia, of Comedy Central fame)."
7442,"This is simply one of the best New Zealand movies made in any century. The growth and resilience of each character portrayed superbly by every single actor from the child stars to the minor adult characters was a pleasure to watch. Beautiful, funny at times, never maudlin, coming of age for the children and adults in the film. In fact, within the first five minutes, there were more laughs than some comedy movies manage to achieve in their entirety. The last scene of the movie makes you feel that you've just experienced something unique that comes on the screen once in 10 years!"
7169,"It's pretty intense and has some very poignant scenes. The characters are multi-dimensional and the acting is fantastic. A movie can be judged by its separate parts, and most of the time it is, but one must also consider the glue that holds the separate parts together. It had all the components of a bad musical: kiddish songs, fairytale romance, nothing bad. Right when you think you have come to accept the history and world around you, this movie reawakens your emotions and makes you feel things that you thoulght you'd come to terms with."
7444,"Which is refreshing in a sense that each time he speaks, you know it's something of substance. Both give standout performances worth of wards. The thing that makes this flick fly is the fantastic performances. The plot and its' details were original in a sense, and the casting was perfect. The chemistry between Reeves and his counterparts (Vera Farmiga and James Caan) was really good and palpable."
7167,"There are some funny moments here. Kudos to the writers on that one, that alone was worth several points on this scale. It was quite funny in parts, and even the most generic parts of it weren't bad - just overly familiar. A charismatic cast and some hilarious jokes makes this a surprising winner. The cast is great in their parts and the script is hilarious."
7446,"Miike Takashi has transformed it into a 126 minutes of pure fun and excitement. The audience there loved it too, breaking out into spontaneous applause during several scenes. Takashi Miike is arguably one of Japan's hardest working directors who has tackled several different genres, generally with good results. The last act is a bloody, pulse - pounding battle which, in spite of its length (over thirty minutes), maintains a great level of tension. His previous films were everything from outstanding to bizarre, but this film speaks volumes."
7165,"He has very firm and uncompromising moral ideals. He's surprisingly very good at showing myriad emotions convincingly. Stealing his limelight is Greta Gerwig as Florence who gives a fine performance here. Let's keep an eye on Mr. Baumbach - he may just be the real deal. It moves slowly and demands extra attention, but even if you're really into the story you might wonder where those 107 minutes went."
7518,"The Character designs are great and the development is wonderful. There were great effects in it. The affects are good, the bad guys are interesting and (compared to Western villains) refreshing and quirky. Gantz really did a decent job with following both the Manga and the Anime. Clearly this is not a low budget movie, the special effects are pretty good."
7163,"Great locations and Cinematography, and very important for Films of the genre - It's fast moving and never boring. Travolta nails every other part of the role. Outrageous action and explosions, plenty of violence (most of it unexpected) - with a very high body count, this is the type of Film that Luc Besson does very well. For the chemistry between the two leads and the action sequences in a beautiful city. Pierre Morel & Luc Besson delivered one of the best action films of the last decade, Taken."
7162,"It's a fast paced and riveting ride from the get - go. What's so impressive about' Green Zone' is the seemingly authentic locations. This was something that you rarely see in movies like this, and made the movie the enjoyable experience that it is. This is a tautly paced, engrossing thriller that inhabits a moral world where all colors are shades of gray. Matt Damon is well suited to his part as a unit leader Roy Miller, as is Brendan Gleeson as the CIA man and Greg Kinnear is refreshingly nasty as Poundstone from the Pentagon - all turn in good performances."
7161,"EVerything that makes Lewis Carroll Lewis Carroll has been leached out of this movie. He has now ruined to wonderful movies, with a lot of help from Tim Burton: Charlie And The Chocolate Factory was excruciating in its twee - ness. With a source material so familiar, even to those whose knowledge is second hand references, there needs to be a degree of innovation (as in Svenkmejer's dark stop - motion version, or the co-opting of Terry Gilliam in to his "" Tideland "" narrative), or else a studious and inspired adaptation that completely returns to Lewis Carroll. Tim Burton used to make interesting movies about interesting people with interesting actors: Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands (what happened to that Johnny Depp? ) The cast acquit themselves well, especially considering the noted difficulty in emoting to a tennis ball on a stick, but all their tics and quirks seem to be masking a void at the centre of what should be a free - floating, evocative trip."
7160,"The portrayal of Rizwan's childhood is amazing. Tanay Chheda is first - rate as the young Rizwan. In the scenes where Rizwan is faced with some sort of confrontation or hard - ship, he goes back into his shell and finds comfort in his religion. This is clearly one of his finest performances. The way Shahrukh Khan has projected himself as an autistic patient is just awesome."
7453,"The beauty of Hilarious is that you can step in at any given point in the movie and never truly feel lost. His stage is very simple, the camera work is very simple, and it's just Louis C. K. running the show and absorbing all the attention. its cool how he relates comedy to deep issues. His topics jump from one end of the spectrum to the next, and that is what makes his comedy appealing â€” the unpredictability of it all. Hilarious by Louie C. K. however, is stand - up art."
7157,"It is a kids' movie and for what it strives to be it fully delivers. There's a fair amount of whimsy and reality which makes it great for children and adults who are children at heart, the little cameo by Seth Macfarlane doesn't hurt either. Thought he made some nice choices. He's a cartoon pragmatist, dispensing hard truths about the impossibility of dreams coming true to young hockey players wanting to be just like him. It's a feel - good story of a jaded and cynical man who realizes that it's okay to dream; it's okay to believe in things you can't see and hope for a better tomorrow."
7156,"The Crazies remake was a fun film. Many twists and turns the film takes aren't very surprising, but The Crazies manages to keeps atmosphere flowing throughout most of the films scenes. Although the Crazies themselves are entertaining, it is nothing viewers probably haven't seen before. All in all, this film is a treat for horror fans and for anyone looking for an intense night out at the movies. Basically, if zombie movies in general are your bag, you should love The Crazies."
7151,"Valetta doesn't get much to do other than play the usual girlfriend / divorcÃ©e / mom of three but she holds her own. In truth, Bob has fallen in love with a beautiful divorcÃ©e, Gillian (Amber Valletta) and wants to marry her. The Spy Next Door makes little to no attempt to even be a good movie. As for the settings, costumes, and production values, they are of the top - shelf variety. After all, as Bob says, he has brought down dictators so he can certainly deal with three kids."
7150,"The quality of the writing is impressive, with no false moves, no red herrings, no unnecessary distractions, no manipulations to sway you one way or another. Taking over an apartment or a job from someone who leaves the scene under very mysterious circumstances is practically the same thing. Just like a Hitchcock movie, the scenes are all necessary, even if they are symbolic. Lovely performances by Olivia Williams, who is sexy and vulnerable, Pierce Brosnan, the absolutely always brilliant Tom Wilkinson and an extraordinary cameo by Actors Studio legend Eli Wallach (he still has the chops! ) Yes, it's a thriller, and as such parts of it are fast paced, but what it does so well is to misdirect your attention for a while before snapping you back to focus."
7149,"They tried to be clever by adding in the famous "" YIPPE KAY YAY, MOTHER F *****! "" Adam Brody was 10 times better in Mr. & Mrs. Smith, in a far smaller role. The camera is always moving in circles, there's one or two moments where the directed object is out of focus, and it's especially shaky in the action scenes. They are not meant to make a huge impact on you, just give you some good laughs for an hour and a half or so. What he may lack in compelling direction skills, he more than makes up for in witty screenplays with equal balance raunch and insight having crafted classics such as Clerks and Chasing Amy."
7459,"A dizzying array of original and masterly techniques. It was eagerly awaited for years, the trailer which was the whole film in fast motion looked ravishing, and it seemed as if in this, perhaps his last film, Godard would deliver his final testament, a summation of all the themes which have run through his work for the last fifty years. Except, unlike Tarantino's work, Godard is not entertaining pub quiz movie geeks; but giving clues to further meanings within his experimental and exploratory work. The film does not quite work as a whole, precisely from this lack of focus, but some of the imagery (some sharp and some out of focus, some old and some new, some seemingly meaningless and some full of allegories, etc.), dialogues (existential, simple, social, revolutionary) and intertitles do reach a cord and will be remembered subconsciously or consciously. Jean - Luc Godard is a reference in cinema and changed the art fifty years ago with a unique challenging style that defied current esthetics and etiquette."
7148,"understandable, they are 1 , 000 pages each. At the start of the movie, he already demonstrated an exceptional ability to remain underwater for long periods of time. He had some REAL background and was a much more interesting character, although, Jake Abel plays his part reasonably well considering he doesn't really have ANY reason to hate the gods. The premise of this movie - that Greek gods were real and have offspring in the modern world - is interesting. Â£ that is named Eragon, but they managed to ruin ANOTHER great book."
7144,"Lehane is one of the luckiest authors on the planet to have his work adapted to the big screen by talents such as Eastwood and Scorsese, but his work is brilliant and deserving of such treatment. It is a complete assault on the senses, and it works beautifully. It is one of the best movies made by director Martin Scorsese. As with Scorsese and DiCaprio's previous collaborations, this is a movie that must be seen. He pays attention to every detail in this film, making "" Shutter Island "" one of the best suspense thrillers of all time."
7461,"The daughter Jeanne moved away and found refuge in the abstract realms of pure mathematics. Incendies already had great source material. Incendies is based on a play but it feels as though it has been adapted from a great literary work. MÃ©lissa DÃ©sormeaux - Poulin and Maxim Gaudette do excellent work as the siblings who gradually begin to understand their mother. Like an intense personal experience, it takes a lot to come to grips with the film's story, a moving plot full of twists and catharsis."
7143,"The beautiful compositions of Danny Elfman, the sets, or the atmosphere Joe Johnston has created, or of course the stunning performances of Emily Blunt and Hugo Weaving. Freed from the usual addiction to hokey visual effects, the movie is able to develop, with subtlety and sophistication, the tragic richness of the story. Benicio Del Toro (An Oscar Winner) portrays the role very well and believable. The set decoration was great - London well - adjusted to 1891, the weapons, costumes and language of the people, the atmosphere, as well. Let's start with the good things: Rick Baker was already loved for his effects in werewolf movies like An American Werewolf in London, and Wolf, as well as other movies where even if the movie's bad like Planet of the Apes, his work is excellent and kudos for getting him back."
7142,"It takes more than just a bunch of big stars to propel a rom - com to quality heights; you need strong writing, good chemistry, strong direction, and a hintage of unpredictability. NOw top it off with every romantic comedy clichÃ© in the book, clone it a few times and top it off again. In the meantime, the Anne Hathaway / Topher Grace story and the conflict involving Kutcher, Alba, Jennifer Garner, and Patrick Dempsey were the most entertaining to watch. The movie had a few (only a few) nice tender moments and plot twists but the amount of bad overshadows this by a long shot. One other note: Ashton Kutcher, Topher Grace, and Bradley Cooper are three men that given the little time in this movie delivered swell performances that was undermined only by the writing."
7138,It does a great job of letting you see the world through the eyes of Temple Grandin. But Danes managed to do it very convincingly. Claire Danes absolutely nailed this performance. It deserves any awards it wins for the excellence of the production values. 999 the character brought to life with an unbelievably immersive portrayal of Ms. Grandin by Ms. Danes.
7510,"Liz may be more than she appears, adding a twist to the proceedings. The thrill factor of course is the make up and effects in having the monsters look their nasty part, although they aren't something that hasn't been seen before on screen. Any classic and really known horror movie is in Dylan Dog comics - Living Dead (saga), Shining, Terminator, vampires, werewolves ,. This also just happens to be the inventor of "" Dellamorte Dellamore ""; one of the top five greatest zombie movies ever made and still one of the most shamefully underrated horror movies in the history of cinema. Sclavi's eccentric universe offers a whole lot of potential and terrific gimmicks, like first and foremost the New Orleans setting and the rather peculiar story aspect of monsters harmoniously existing together, and director Kevin Munroe ("" TMNT "") also tries hard to make his film accessible to all kinds of cinematic audiences, but the whole thing is just too damn derivative and reminiscent to other (also inferior) franchises like "" Underworld "", "" Constantine "", "" Van Helsing "", "" Watchmen "" and who knows what else."
7134,"Jay O. Sanders plays a solid role as Detective Whitehouse. Everything about the movie was believable and memorable. The pacing is pretty quick in some places, so it keeps you interested. At the end of the proceedings, Edge of Darkness is a very good and satisfying thriller. This is a top notch thriller that also has some unusual twists at the end."
7133,"Well at least the performances are watchable. They hit it off well and reach a point where both parties take an interest in the other. Well, you may laugh, you may roll your eyes--you may do both simultaneously. Without a doubt, slapstick is the ruling theory of comedy in this film, but if one manages to pay close enough attention, they may find themselves appreciating some of the more subtle jabs. Following the trend , 2010's first romantic comedy' When In Rome' hopes to achieve the same success with similar tactics."
7129,"moments and the end leaves it nicely open for a sequel. All in all, Legion is hugely entertaining, some scenes having serious WTF? Him being born will be a sign that humans will live on. Also worth mentioning is solid supporting roles from Kate Walsh, Jon Tenney, and Willa Holland. Even with good actors reading it, some of the dramatic parts drag on unbelievably."
7469,"The stylish BOURNE looking action scenes specially needs to be appreciated. The pacing is nicely done with properly placed comic moments as well. Korean thriller makers are making a splendid job now - a-days, they have even succeeded the Hollywood thriller makers in this specific genre. Some funny characters and parts are nicely putted into, that enhanced the color and variety of the movie. It's a good film and is worth watching especially to Won Bin fan (But there are scenes that you may find it so cruel and disturbing)."
7112,"Even amidst such despair, one can rise and accomplish anything. Moody slo - mo shots abound with wonderfully toned colors. He brings an intensity in his demeanor that makes him an intriguing character and the film does a good job of making his character more central than anything else. There's a style and grace to their action scenes--they create a sort of a moving tableau in some scenes and execute a wide range of tempos in the action sequences to make them more intense. The other aspects lending to the power of The Book of Eli are its technical aspects."
7111,"It is rooted, it is humanistic, and it is earnestly funny in spots. The Irish scenes are gorgeous, and the accents entertaining. Adams and Goode have amazing chemistry and perform their personalities to a T. Both leads were outstanding in this film. Not because it's anything amazing or Oscar - worthy."
7845,"Nevertheless Krysten Ritter is hot and sexy and makes the film work reasonably. The best part was the somewhat clever opening credits score. Andy is in love and engaged to Lauren Baker (Krysten Ritter) for one year but he is unable to satisfy Lauren in bed. In Los Angeles, the clumsy Andy Conners (Josh Meyers) works at the Fearless Records selecting new talents. Throw in some funny lines and comedy and your movie "" works ""."
7871,"Both leads (and Mr Pevsner) had nice bodies and nice butts. Their skills are 50% of the reason why this review got 4 stars instead of 2. It could have been 15 minutes shorter, and have moved faster throughout. For 20 years Law & Order found a way to float the camera and bring some visual energy to a dialog - heavy scene, and audiences have come to like / want that. There were no technical notes given, but assuming it was shot with a Red, the DP did a credible job, especially given that he had 8 days to shoot everything."
8011,"The depiction of alternate Earths can lead to bigger expansion in the near future. The best are Gina Torres, who gives Superwoman a great femme - fatale edge, and especially James Woods, whose Owlman is just superb. In fact better than some real life movies Voice Actors: Good. Dwayne McDuffie manages to craft a story that stands out on its own while carrying all the elements of what made the DCAU. Co-directors Lauren Montgomery and Sam Liu combine their talents to bring out the best in every scene from the subtle drama to the hard hitting fights."
8035,"This is definitely different to the other romantic - comedies that you see today and it's a welcoming change. Rashad (Of Cosby fame) and Pam Grier do well as the respected parents. It's very predictable and you'll more than likely guess everything within the first minute of the movie but it's such a charming movie and the story is a good story to follow. She is everything a Woman should be in this world, and she pulled it off with conviction and believability. The chemistry between Queen Latifah and Comm0n was brilliant and very believable."
7477,"But here he has focused all his ambition, influences and talent into creating a truly memorable debut. The film arrives amidst critical praise and festival word - of - mouth, and the promise of a real future talent in director Richard Ayoade. One of the main strengths of the film is it's awareness of slipping into clichÃ©. Craig Roberts plays Oliver Tate in a star - making performance that will surely see him become one of Britain's finest young actors in the next few years. However, on the evidence that Richard Ayoade presents here, Submarine might just be a glimpse of the great things to come."
7478,"Everything Must Go is probably Will Ferrell's first truly well done film in years. "" Everything Must Go "" is a wonderful film. A sub-plot involves Nick getting acquainted with the woman across the street who has just moved to the neighborhood and is awaiting her husband's arrival. He returns home to find out his wife has changed all the locks on the house, and has moved all of his belongings to the front yard. And for a movie to bring these truths to light in such an artistic, engaging and REAL fashion."
7479,"An extraordinary creature who carries as much humanity as its human counterparts. Three time periods are presented in overlapping form to an effective end. Heck, it was pretty well embraced and accepted by the 80s and certainly the 90s . ) The performances by all three are truly out of this world. beautiful and serene beyond anything that words could hope to encapsulate."
8067,"No one makes Trigun music better than Imahori - Sama, no one! Trigun Badlands Rumble is a very good movie, with some nice nostalgia for Trigun fans. You really have to thank the creators for their great vision, Vash the Stampede's character is pure genius, he's the hero that everybody loves and respects, and you'll find this apparent in both the TV series and movie. A great thanks to the author for this wonderful' goodbye' for all the fans of Trigun. Vash the Stampede, a gunfighter with a giant bounty on his head, always wearing his favorite red - colored trench coat, is back."
8104,"They tried to make it believable by adding twice the shake (and zoom) as in the usual found footage movies. It was scary but doesn't have a lot of nonstop jolts like the Paranormal Activity series but the intensity is their and the fear of the unknown and the big reveal at the end was clever and shocking and gave it an even more sinister tone that will get under your skin but still expected something bigger and different but liked the direction it took which was a different change of pace. To the movies credit, if they cut those horribly boring long scenes this would have been a great movie. This movie has a very thick atmosphere, especially SPOILER SPOILER all the parts done in this labyrinth are awesome. SPOILER SPOILER Fernando Barreda Luna found a pretty clever solution for that, they needed the night view of their cameras to see something in the dark."
7483,"Returning from the first one are the awesome duo of Adrienne Palicki and Emmanuelle Chriqui, who are maybe the most moving part of the story. ELEKTRA LUXX is striking first and foremost for its jigsaw - like structure. Mr. Gutierrez keeps things moving at a quick pace, which benefits the enjoyment of the film. Her character isn't as simple as you may think and Gugino plays the role with such passion that you just enjoy every moment she is on screen. Within a few minutes, Sebastian Gutierrez appeared on stage doing a one man show entertaining the audience to the highest level possible."
7683,"This is classic detective story with very modern elements like atomic fusion and a sexual charge uncommon 40 years ago. Right from the opening credits, the music and visuals seem to surround you in acidic euphoria. The movie starts out well enough and for about the first 40 minutes or so weaves a mildly interesting plot. Banderas (havent seen him in a while) gives a very good performance. The use of special effects is absolutely genius."
7253,"Alice Krige (Morgana) is good and looks young. But better to throw in dozens of special effects and action sequence. The 2 main female characters are lovely and appealing personalities. And Baruchel proved to be well cast as the nerdy, endearing, reluctant hero / apprentice. THE SORCEROR'S APPRENTICE is fun, and at a time where movies like these fail to deliver such simple mercies, it's a pleasant little surprise."
7252,"They are many better crafted and acted movies surrounding this theme available before you get to this point. The cinematography is beautiful in this film and the acting is well done by the four principles. The cast of almost unknowns do fairly well here, and the beautiful lacey chabert should go on to do better stuff. Director Jeffery Scott does a good job here, not having too long of an intro to the characters at the start which some films make a meal of and then once they get into trouble, he builds the suspense and the angst slowly. Lacey Charbert's character came off as a bit of a know it all, a limitless source of information and the hero of near every scene while the men came off as a bit whiny and rather useless and the ending hit full throttle suddenly and just slammed through a scene that could have built a good long bit of hopelessness."
7255,"Not destined for any Ten Best Lists, but enjoyable summer entertainment. Bottom Line: While it could have been so much more, and could have really been something truly special, Knight and Day is still an admirable movie thanks to its leads --- even if age is starting to catch up to them. Their comic timing is great, and can still deliver the emotions when you need them to. It did not do well at the box office domestically because U. S film critics were harsh, but it performed superbly in the international market. If you like action packed comedies, knight and day is perfect for you."
7251,"The makings of a pretty good film! , "" Grown Ups "" is the perfect film for you. When they finally introduce antagonists into the movie (almost an hour in), it's like Sandler and friends decided it as an afterthought. "" Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Rob Schneider, David Spade and Chris Rock, hanging out in a lake house, cracking wise at each other for two hours? Lenny (Adam Sandler) and his pals Eric (Kevin James), Kurt (Chris Rock), Marcus (David Spade), and Rob (Rob Schneider) once played on a junior champion basketball team, winning at the buzzer."
7257,"The story telling was simply awful, everything was just plain rushed. The best scenes from the original are inexplicably absent. Chan of course is his brilliant sole - choreographed self but even after so much time, is sometimes barely understandable yet the subtitles ignore him completely. The pluses are definitely Chan and some elements of the fight production; far outweighed by a non-existent soundtrack, average acting, drawn out and unnecessary plotting plus dialogue which barely works said in English and translates even worse when presented on screen in subtitles - an interesting consideration and challenge for screenwriters and filmmakers everywhere - but one in which Murphey fails. Do yourselves a favour and rent the original and save yourselves the horror of Jadens smarmy acting and smart Alec attitude."
7258,"The acting is all impressive, especially Ruffalo and Bening. It is a well acted and realistic character study though with the likes of Julianne Moore, Annette Bening, Mark Ruffalo, Josh Hutcherson and' ALICE IN WONDERLAND's Mia Wasikowska. He also discovers that the children he fathered so anonymously now mean everything to him. The family in the movie, Nic (Annette Benning), Jules (Julianne Moore), Lazer (Josh Hutcherson), and Joni (Mia Wasilowska), kind of all have that same desperation lingering around them. Nic will loosen up and the kids will be able to open up to people because someone finally understands them."
8288,"That being said, the film is shot beautifully and uses a wide variety of creative shots and transitions. The cinematography is stylish, the acting is fantastic and the score provide some chills. Nice looking woman though and some others as well. The overall result is an impeccably paced, brutal but surprisingly uplifting story, beautifully shot against the backdrop of Hong Kong's endless arrays of high - rises and apartment blocks. A review blurb from Salon on the DVD cover says the movie is "" Hilarious ""."
7261,"But it's among the best ones. The Burton ones, the Nolan ones are fantastic! The music, the art direction, the characters, the cast, everything was just great! It has a dark, haunting visual style, with smooth backgrounds, well drawn characters and atmospheric colouring, not to mention a beautifully realised Gotham City. Bruce Greenwood does a phenomenal Batman and Neal Patrick Harris complements him beautifully as Nightwing."
7262,"Salt delivers exactly what is promised--a solid 100 minutes of action. If you like the action movie genre, chances are you will enjoy this movie. In "" Salt "", when Angelina Jolie jumps consecutively onto six moving trucks on the freeway, she's flying right up and instantly running at Olympic record pace, sort of like the original Terminator except sporting lipstick. The action scenes are sharply directed and Jolie finally gets her hands dirty, particularly in the opening exchanges where she's being tortured in a Korean prison. The question of where Salt's loyalties lie is the true source of tension and Jolie plays it cool, gaining and dismissing the audience's trust several times over."
7250,"The levels and the layers on which thing are happening are so many, that one surely'll miss something vital. Then there's the strong ensemble cast, led by a quite scintillating performance from DiCaprio. As for acting, DiCaprio was good. Following on from his cards played close to his chest turn in Shutter Island, DiCaprio has given 2010 two of its best lead performances. its plot - there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns."
7513,"ON THE WATERFRONT and EAST OF EDEN are the two films that get the majority of the running time. Quite touching is A Letter to Elia and highly recommended to followers of both. Fans of either Scorsese or Kazan should certainly check out this love letter between one master to another. In Reflections on Kazan, actors Alec Baldwin, Al Pacino, Ellen Burstyn, and Robert De Niro who appeared in Elia's The Last Tycoon, among others discuss the director's unique methods and his demeanors and attitudes. Martin Scorsese co-wrote, co-directed, and appears telling how much film director Elia Kazan meant to him from childhood on to his first meeting with him when he was a guest speaker at New York University where Marty was a student in 1964."
8372,"These are two very complex and incredible performances. There were some excellent performances in The Pacific. Perhaps the greatest distinction between the two mini-series was intentional. The battle scenes were done very well and played very realistically. There were a few, though, who were totally believable including Jon Seda."
7266,"The only positive note is the act of both Steve Carell and Paul Rudd who despite a shaky scenario manage to pull off a great performance. Just as he is beginning to agree with her, he meets Barry (Steve Carell). A few scattered laughs is the best you can hope for. In this case the casting of every part, even the little ones, is what pushes this movie over the top into one of the funniest movies that has been released in a while. The idea, presumably, is that good performances can boost a weak script into something amusing."
7268,"But, everything else is a work of a masterpiece! At the end, who can satisfy everyones appetite! His acting is very good and he has perfect moves. What Hung designs, Yen executes with masterful control and precision. The kungfu moves were also well directed."
7269,"The performers are flawless, especially Zac Efron. Though the story is heavy on the saccharine edge and strains credibility, the team of actors is very fine - especially Zac Efron, whose presence is on the screen in practically every frame - so the film ends up being endearing. Charlie St. Cloud is a remarkable story about life and love, death and loss, letting go and moving on. Ben Sherwood's Novel THE DEATH AND LIFE OF CHARLIE ST. CLOUD pretty much describes this Hallmarky love and spiritualism showcase for teen idol Zac Efron. Charlie St. Cloud (Zac Efron, who holds in own in this rather implausible role) is a highly regarded young sailor who is wins a sailing scholarship to Stanford upon graduation from high school."
8514,"There are wonderful appearances by Jules Ritmanic and Linda Doudaeva, as Blaise and Milana. An entertaining film by Romain Goupil, who also appears in it. The good news is that Milana's case has been solved and she can remain in France. The neighborhood is basically full of immigrants. A mindful and significant drama which gained the European Silver Ribbon Valeria Bruni Tedeschi at the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists in 2011."
7271,"Then stay tuned for the credits, when the commentary rushes at you full - force. Will Ferral and Mark Wahlberg are both hilarious in this. This is the first Will Ferrell movie that you must pay close attention to (in terms of visual humor and crime - solving), and is overall one of his best movies. But, unlike the other movies, the third act stays afloat thanks to the Wahlberg / Ferrell mix, as well as the continuing mystery that was slowly unfolding. The last mainstream comedy to attempt this was the mildly underrated Fun with Dick and Jane remake with Jim Carrey."
7272,"They were two of the most prominent faces in Columbia. The film does a very good job at telling all sides of the story. This was captured in a very objective manner again a wonderful job by the Zimbalist brothers. The film is in Spanish with English subtitles, which was another brave move by ESPN but once again this series pays off. One was an honourable and inspirational athletic hero, the other gained his local reputation as a Robin Hood of sorts."
8536,"If they continue with this stuff, good things will happen. It is predictable as all things Disney are when it comes to movies. When her big day gets off on the wrong foot, Abby is granted 16 b - day wishes by a magical being. Contrast that with the Camp Rock II consisting of multiple top Disney stars and big names, it had a year long marketing on - slot in magazines, radio spots, interviews, merchandise, posters, billboards, malls, multiple Web Presents, Disney Channel commercials network and Nick channel commercials, etc. . 16 Wishes was a good family movie."
7274,"you will definitely like "" The Expendables "". The Expendables is a movie that lifts you up out of your seat, pats you on the head, gives you a lollipop then smashes you in the frickin' face! from the start you should know this is all about guns, explosives and one liners from start to finish and homage to silly 80's and 90's action flicks. It has the perfect blend of humor, blood, sweat, smart - ass comebacks, witty one - liners, and an overabundance of testosterone! The heroine is tortured, then dragged through bullets, raging fires and explosions as the whole set is blown up, yet emerges unscathed with perfect hairdo."
7275,"Scott Pilgrim is one of the most refreshing teen - sophomore movies produced in the last years, and one the best movies of 2010. It gives the movie an incredible rhythm, reaching new levels of dynamism and the use of CGI and the visual design is plain fantastic. However, Cera really shines in this movie, in part because his physique really portraits the character from the start. This is one of the most innovative, original movies to come out in years. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World succeeds in telling an offbeat story, providing interesting characters, and in producing lots of laughs."
7467,"Performances are outstanding all around, with Cotillard once again stealing every second she is on the screen. The film is set in several time periods, and Paris glows intensely and seductively in everyone of those. From the opening montage of lush, picturesque Parisian scenes the film is a love letter to the city of lights. Midnight in Paris is a gourmet meal of delectably charming and playful scenes. Woody Allen's latest is beautifully written and a charming story that belongs in the top ten of his all - time greats."
7514,"And once again, the Weta team did a phenomenal job with their brilliant special effects. As plots go, this is pretty basic. There is a real connection that the audience feels with Caesar and it is all thanks to Serkis' work. Not only is the C. G. I. good, but the character is written very well in general. Not only do apes most definitely rise in this movie, but they also do so with clear tremendous purpose."
7533,"time together, which actually seemed to be Nim's best time with any humans. Such is the case with award - winning documentarian James Marsh and his presentation of Project Nim. Equally interesting and perhaps the root cause of what happens later is the relationships between the humans. Nim seemed to interact in so many subtle and fascinating ways during the process of his teaching, and he seemed to teach a great deal to all of the assistants who gave him their care. What emerges will probably anger and sadden most viewers."
7353,"Alex Pettyfer is too wonderful to miss. The novel Beastly by Alex Flinn is phenomenal. Vanessa Hudgens is a gorgeous girl, but that's really all she is. A modern retelling, good - looking leads, gorgeous cinematography and Neil Patrick Harris? Despite the flaws, this film actually entertains on DVD."
7380,"Give movies the credit they deserve and see it for what it is - a piece of entertainment. Now one could say that there are these great fight scenes thanks to Kato (played by John Cho). Had they cast someone else for Britt Reid, it would have worked much better. There are a lot of possibilities for this character, and Rogan didn't seem to like any of them. Both men bring much to the partnership, and both are excellent fighters, just in different styles."
7384,"Nic Cage is becoming the master of these kinds of movies. It's a bit of a clichÃ©, but director Dominic Sena handles it very well. "" Season "" hovers on the edge of clicheness fairly often. These moments, however, lend a much - needed lightheartedness to a movie that keeps your heart pounding almost nonstop, and the caliber of the acting and directing keep it from going over the edge. The special effects are kinda lame and the film drags in certain spots, but overall "" Season of the witch "" is a decent thriller with some cheesy dialouge."
7386,"Both are excellent giving weight to the proceedings. The way to win lives is truly amazing. There is a subtle funny line at least every few minutes. It has a star - studded cast and a fun twist on sci - fi action thrillers. The genre experiment generally works from a tonal perspective, an obstacle that certainly stood in Favreau's path."
7390,"Not one of Ron Howard's best films. Some funny ones like NIGHT SHIFT, and some dramatic ones like A BEAUTIFUL MIND and APOLLO 13. You'd think that, with all those years in Happy Days, he'd have a good grasp of comedy. True, this may not be a fresh comedy nor a classic but it is well acted and it tries to avoid being cheesy, even though it may very well be at some points. But there are some good things in it, and chief among these are the real - and touching - relationships between Vaughan and friend James and, particularly, girlfriend Connelly."
7394,"Limitless entertains with the possibilities and the consequences of uncontrollable powers. pretty much charms your pants off. Overall, the acting was convincing and the special effects weren't distracting, but rather cleverly woven into the scenes. Good performances by all the actors. Overall, in spite of all the shortcomings, Limitless is still a really good movie."
7399,"The best parts of the film can be easily gathered as follow : 1. Nevertheless, it manages to provide entertainment with the presence of the biggest stars from China. They have great chemistry and provide fireworks during their scenes. With the two, What Women Want gets attention and with attention comes a decently made, polish production values and purely commercialised Mainland product. Andy Lau and Gong Li are two of the most attractive and charismatic superstars of their age and it's a perfect dream match in this romance comedy."
7401,"Romantic comedies need a good kick in the pants, and an aging Ivan Reitman ain't the guy to do it. And at that price, you'd still be better off with a random McConaughey rom - com instead. "" No Strings Attached "" might have been a decent film had it followed through on its premise, but that it falls victim to just about every romcom trapping negates the most potentially interesting thing it has going for it. Their quirky relationship begins when they are both sexually frustrated teenagers at summer camp. Sure the ending is predictable and a few of the background actors deliver lackluster performances but Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher fit very nicely together as the main characters, you could really tell they had fun working together."
7402,"Mr. McConaughey's performance is energetic, engaging and entertaining. The cast surrounding McConaughey has been selected with care and all of them offer realistic performances. It also reignites the career of Matthew McConaughey as an actor, not just a charismatic star. Matthew McConaughey played a very believable and spot on performance as Mick. The perfect antidote to some of the blockbusters and cartoons on offer at the moment."
7403,"Also a really great portrayal of Superman as Clark Kent, and fun to see how he switches between the two in some scenes. The interaction between Superman and Lex Luthor when they did happen were also really well done and intriguing. Iv' e been away from superman the comic for quiet some time - but have seen all of the DC movie material that have been available, but non of the other renditions of Supermans story comes close to this one - This knowing that most of the material is from Morrison's: All Star Superman Comic series - the movies overall style is true to the Comic version with bright colors, light humor and great scenes. The animated movie not only sticks to the "" self - contained stories "" format but also the well developed personalities and timeless characterization. Moi Studios once again perform animation duties, maintaining the smooth character movements seen in their previous productions; smoother than Japanese anime at least and without animation short - cuts."
7405,"A stand - out performance is offered by Bruno Ganz and also Diane Kruger supports Neeson quite well. Liam Neeson is turning into quite an action star these days despite his advancing age. Everything works in the thriller: performances, cinematography, music score and specially the twist. The supporting cast led by January Jones, Diane Kruger, and Frank Langella is really good as well. Good suspense â€” the sound mixers must've had a kick in adding emphasis on sound effects to startle the audience."
7423,This sunset is anything but limited. It gels so well with the words of Cormac McCarthy. Samuel L. Jackson plays to his strengths. The powerhouse combination of Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones. the superb Tommy Lee Jones and the furious Samuel L. Jackson.
7406,"Miguel Arteta did a terrific job directing the talented ensemble. Ed Helms, Anne Heche, John C. Riley and Isiah Whitlock Jr. take you on one heck of a funny ride from the very beginning all the way through the end credits. Mr. Helms is really a comic force. Director Miguel Arteta ("" Youth in Revolt "") seems to show an adeptness at this kind of comedy, drawing performances from the cast that provide nuanced characterization and believability. And married, but sweet Joan (Heche)."
7407,"The setting with gnomes is flawless - the sounds, the implications of being a garden gnome - it works out really well. The voices were all well cast, and the animation is of a good quality. The animation is great - the gnomes and the gardens are just lovely to watch. Spotting the celebrity voices is fun too. It was fun to pick out the Shakespeare references; the removal firm was Rosancranz and Guildenstern, for instance."
7409,"To quote the Brits, "" It's brilliant! "" The running time is a perfect 104 minutes. They're effectively supported by the wonderful Kristin Wiig, the no - nonsense (to an extent) Jason Bateman and Bill Hader. The character Paul was so nicely made, and the textures of his skin, face and eyes was off the charts. Right, well throughout the movie there was a bunch of subtle and not so subtle references to other movies."
7412,"Rango himself upon first meet is absolutely NOT a hero. "" Rango "" doesn't quite capture the degree of humor and emotional depth that the Pixar greats of the last few years have, but it's a fun adventure with exquisite animation, tasteful characters and a good heart, which puts it as an above - average offering compared to others of its kind. No, "" Rango "" won't challenge kids to contemplate their role in the cosmos, but that's precisely the predicament of its main character, a theatrical lizard who finds himself â€” as many animals in animated films do these days â€” thrust out of domestic bliss and forced to reckon with the untamed and unforgiving nature of the wild natural world. Only with a Pixar gold standard in place does "" Rango "" come across as flawed; otherwise it's an absolutely pleasant watch from start to finish. Well Rango is not flawless but it is still entertaining."
7413,"Rest of the cast fit their roles perfectly, with a huge cry to Chris Pratt and Dan Fogler. Topher Grace does an awesome job, and Dan Fogler is absolutely hilarious in it. And it succeeds, while not going too serious and keeping it feel - good in the lines of the aforesaid movies. All in all, a good time will be had by all who go who like these kinds of movies! The film does a good job of pulling off a classic 80's throwback feel and definitely accomplishes what it set out to do."
7415,"Production values are good, although not of the highest flight. The many scenes between Blunt and Damon are very believable and natural, real chemistry in action and is fun to watch. In case you are not aware of it, this makes Phillip K. Dick officially one of the most influential storytellers in the last 50 years. Terence Stamp, still with one of the best voices in the business, together with Anthony Mackie & John Slattery, do good work as the agents attempting to get everything back on track. It is the pulsating chemistry between lead stars Matt Damon and the sensually beguiling Emily Blunt set in all the famous spots of Manhattan and NYC."
7417,"It was marketed as an action film, with good death scenes, mildly intriguing characters, and a simple plot and it delivered exactly on cue. Of course he wants to walk in his fathers footsteps. The wonderful locations give it an air of realism and the soundtrack complements the setups. For a brisk 90 mins, it manages to provide on some no holds barred, brutal and bloody action. There are quite a few fairly well done action scenes in the movie ranging from silent assassinations to the obligatory blow things up scenes."
7418,"in an era of burgeoning comedic genius, this is and pair of wrinkled testes floating in a bowl of warm corona light. This this the best Farrelly brothers movie since Stuck on You! On one hand it's an "" American Pie "" type comedy, where you're laughing at how bad the situation has become for a character, and then it's attempting to be all grown up, emitting a deep emotive, heartfelt message about life, love and loss."
7419,"This is one of the movie's strongest points, proving that simplicity is the key to making some great moments in the film. Bell slots in nicely as the weak of body but strong of mind slave, Esca, the unrecognisable Rahim scores very well as a warrior tribesman, while the technical touches within the picture (including Ã–rvarsson's score) are genre compliant. But the Britons keep up their Gaelic, and they speak it smoothly and fluently, too. 20 years later and Marcus Flavius Aquila (Tatum) arrives in Britain to serve as a garrison commander. Great to report that CGI and digital blood are not dominating proceedings, this is very human, even if the editing is of the whippy kind."
7420,"If you are a girl who has just entered her teens and is tired of movies about whiny vampires, then you might enjoy this. The special effects were superb as were the action scenes. Glee's Dianna Agron plays Number Four's love interest. She comes across very natural, so that the love story that unfolds is actually engaging instead of vomit - inducing like that of that other movie with the whining Vampires and the shirtless Werewolves. His role is more of a babysitter for Number Four than a warrior / guardian who dispenses valuable training and wisdom."
7421,"Although there isn't a lot of blood, there are certainly a lot of deaths. The special effects were also quite good, with the exception of a couple bad animations here and there. The aliens themselves are pretty cool. But video game enthusiasts would be better served sticking to the virtual battlefield because the shabbiness of this picture is one of its few surprises. One minute everyone will be walking somewhere between point A and B, the next, they're crouching behind burned out cars and houses as aliens pour ungodly hellfire onto them from above."
7424,"Fogler and Harnois are both very good. As a small bonus at the end they shows behind the scenes of how they filmed it with live action actors, very cool. Mars Needs Moms has some redeeming values. It's fast paced and beautiful to look at (thankfully, now that it's on video, you don't have to see the colors diminished in 3D), and it's very funny. Like andrewj - lee wrote, how fun to read the obviously planted movie reviews here."
7426,"For the most part these moments are delivered. Decker and Aniston both of course fill this role, quite well. Aniston is the prize winner here. Sandler was funny as usual and meshed very well with Jennifer Aniston. Nick Swardson deserves fame for this."
7428,"But Miss Hardwicke did coordinate well with her production designer, for the sets are quite good. Plus there are two good performances, Gary Oldman and Julie Christie. And she does have a good eye for a shot, and several scenes here show. It has moments of campy fun, specifically every second Gary Oldman appears as a sinister Cardinal Richelieu - type character, but other scenes are played ridiculously straight. If there is one good performance at all it is by Julie Christie, who is just as magnetic and wonderful as she was when she graced the screen in David Lean's "" Doctor Zhivago "" forty - six years ago."
7429,"In overall, the acting was good and the performances were well enough. The first was merely decent, second went down like a lead balloon, and this part definitely shows signs of a universal panning. At least the movies that appeared in "" Mystery Science Teather 3000 "" were funny to watch, despite being bad. To live in the world of Big Momma, it helps if you have the intelligence of a box of instant potatoes. The film, as well as sequel, is a reboot to the series by initiating Trent as the lead character and opting to appeal to a teenage audience instead of a mature or family - friendly one like the predecessors."
7431,"Vera Farmiga is obviously good in here. All four principal actors do well and Gyllenhaal, especially, carries the plot forward extremely well. this is the type of movies that will keep you interested till the very ending. There is amazing, subtle chemistry between Jake and Michelle which really is the star of the film, performances by all the actors are excellent. The movie have many intriguing subplots that is not easy to figure out."
7432,"It ends up being the most commendable aspect of Fukunaga's vision, but maybe the most hampering as well. The sets, costumes, lighting, art, mood, cinematography, and score were all excellent. Charlotte BrontÃ«'s seminal literary work "" Jane Eyre "" has been adapted countless times and prepared in a myriad of ways from the 1943 Joan Fontaine / Orson Welles version that was whittled to an hour and a half to the 1983 BBC mini-series with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton that spans five - plus hours. She wasn't a modern actress in a corset, she moved like a young woman who is used to the corset and layers of cloth, and the expectations on a young woman in Victorian England. Rather than telling the tale in a linear fashion, it begins at a crisis moment later in the story, and tells the majority of the tale in flashback â€“ - which works wonderfully well, enabling screenwriter Moira Buffini to effectively compress a long novel into a two - hour time span."
7433,"the fight scenes are an absolute nerdgasm, a sci - fi / fantasy orgy of epic proportions. Overall the movie has stunning visuals, great action scenes, and worthwhile acting. The abundant CG is stunningly beautiful and doesn't feel overdone or become visually exhausting like some movies. Oh yeah, and one more thing: If someone fights for your right to breathe free, fight for the next person's right. Prepare yourself to lose everything and gain the perfect victory."
7438,"It plays out like a regular episode as opposed to a special and loses some of the charm of the predecessors where you get the feeling they really enjoyed making them and that isn't there here. this wasn't the best star wars out of the family guy trilogy but was good. Worth seeing and certainly not the dire spectacle that others here have said, but not as good as they first managed and it certainly had room to be sharper. A few jokes are hilarious, while the others are all over the place and considerably less than funny. The first Star Wars spoof was endlessly enjoyable, casting favourite Family Guy characters as the now classic characters from the Star Wars universe, providing a fresh slant on the old story."
7440,"To put the icing on the cake, the production values are sweet. Regardless of these flaws, the film is still an incredible experience based solely on the incredible displays of creative gore. It's bigger, louder, and prouder. This film has a superb nostalgic look, and it's one of the most colorful and vibrant movies projected on screen. This films greatest strength is its oddball tone and freakishly beautiful bursts of violence that occur periodically through the movie."
7441,"Paul Giamatti is awesome, simple as that. Also worth mentioning is the always fantastic Jeffrey Tambor, equally as cool as Giamatti. Paul Giamatti and Amy Ryan are perfect. It's a typically masterful Giamatti performance, and for once he's not a total loser who's in over his head. Bobby Cannavale (also from "" The Station Agent) sparkles in every scene."
7443,"Be it manipulating his little brother to achieve his motives, or embarrassing his little brother for his own pleasure, or even to passing on his little brother the "" good "" stuffs The decision to concentrate on the relationship between the brothers was original and smart, because it added an element of conflict that the book lacked and spiced it up a bit. The content is largely humorous, whether it's the quirky behaviours of the kids, the older brother Rodrick or even the Heffley parents. â€¢ Did you have fights with him all throughout your childhood? As suggested by the title, this movie is more focused on the brothers' relationship, a further development from the first movie of the series."
7445,"Visual effects will get Academy nominated, story borrows from the various Christmas movies, live action acting is OK, but the music is great. This one needed more laughs to keep it moving along. Many reviewers have claimed that it is a combination of "" Willy Wonka "" starring in a holiday themed film and it actually work out splendidly. Nicely animated, but short on guffaws. They should realize that this movie is targeted towards kids while at the same time if the adults actually pay attention and listen closely they will enjoy this movie."
7447,"There are a handful of set pieces, and they are a delight to behold. Saoirse Ronan is brilliant as Hanna. The choice of music is inspired and the way that is has been synced to the action serves to heighten the tension in the scenes. The joy is in the discovery, as they say, and Hanna is best served with as few expectations as possible. The only truly great performance comes from Ronan, but Tom Hollander, Cate Blanchett and Eric Bana all turn out good performances that serve the picture well."
7449,"Don't compare it to the original but compare it to the other things Russell has done and you will see that he might actually have a great future at comedy ahead of him. It garnered 4 Oscar nominations and 2 wins. Jennifer Garner is scarily comfortable in the role of a-grade beyatch! Arthur is made with a view to entertaining it's viewers and does a pretty good job of it, IMHO (but hey, a packed theatre of people laughing would not mean anything, right? ) He said the one liners were better and Russell Brand made a more convincing drunk."
7450,"Jesse Eisenber and Anne Hathaway did their best voice acting. The artwork is indeed good in most scenes and breathtaking in one or two. An easy going adventure with fun and random musical numbers and breath - taking scenery. The flying sequence is indeed breathtaking even if it's in 2D. All in all, it works great on the children, and works OK on their parents / guardians."
7451,"It's done so well it can't be anything other than achingly familiar. However, when the film does have its shining moments, they are extremely memorable. To be specific it shines first five minutes and then the last say 20 seconds. Presently, the film has received mostly positive reviews and was praised for the imagery used throughout the film. The camera work and settings used in this film are really something to talk about."
7452,"Possessing not only impressive physical training and memorable appearance, Hamsworth was able to convey the power and emotions of this character. And Branagh's competent direction, the excellent performances and the solid screenplay make Thor to be a very entertaining movie. Considering the larger - than - life origins of the Thor comic, involving beings with the power and appearance of Gods and the various machinations of their story, the material fits fairly well with Branagh's body of work to a great extent. Now, the honored actor and director of the dramatic cinema and theater Kenneth Brana demonstrated miracles by taking off a large - scale fantasy comics epic. The cinematic entry for this character, titled simply Thor, is among the better of the Marvel adaptations of recent years, mixing a good sense of fun, strong acting, and some Shakespearian level drama that makes for an especially entertaining time at the movies."
7456,"Congratulations to everyone, Mr. Haynes well done. The first 3 episodes were really great. The first night, Parts 1 & 2, were riveting. The two girls had three major scenes together and they were incredibly good, nay quite brilliant. Well done Mr. Haynes bringing this cast together and thank you for the magic."
7457,"The cinematography, costumes, score and acting all added up to an interesting and quite lovely spectacle. All in all a wonderful and deeply satisfying experience at the movies, well worth every dime. She also fits surprisingly well to the 1930s platinum blonde beauty type. While the leads (Robert Pattinson, Reese Witherspoon, Christoph Waltz) all turn in GREAT performances, the real star here is Tai the elephant. Reese Witherspoon has always been a true professional and here with her stunts demonstrates that again."
7458,"The Last Lions did everything right. It is beautifully shot with stunning cinematography and a brilliant soundtrack with the exception of the Jordinn Sparks track that takes place during the closing credits. Good if you've never watched anything similar, average if you have. Also, The Last Lions was much more dramatic and engaging. The movie does not try to out - do its predecessors and be more than it is, it stays to it's story and it's themes and makes for a wonderful film for anyone."
7468,One of the most sensational aspects of the picture is the performance anchoring it all from Thomas Doret. The first part of the film is full of extremely strong dramatic scenes. The story moves along well with a good score and nice editing. The bonding between Thomas Doret and CÃ©cile De France is something completely magnificent to watch. It's a very warming dynamic and the Dardennes really make you feel all of the highs and lows of it.
7460,"Everything about this film is awesome! It delivers on action, cars, quality acting and a decent storyline. Fast Five picks up, literally, right where Fast & Furious left off. Everyone from The Rock to Ludicrous play their characters great and have their own moments to shine. Energetic movies meant to entertain, a good solid waste of time!"
7462,"As for the movie--someone said it best. Ginnifer Goodwin is very well known for been the consummate good girl. Well played roles by Ginnifer Goodwin and John Krasinski keep the viewer engaged and entertained. Ginnifer Goodwin was fantastic in the role (not her fault the storyline is idiotic). Colin Egglesfield is beautiful, though a bit stiff, and perfect to play the part of the swine Dex."
7463,"This should make Wiig a star--and she deserves it (she has a Meg Ryan quality). Several scenes had just the right amount of awkwardness or pause or "" beat "" that really added an extra element of hilarity. Not only is she consistently and uniquely funny, but her character is surprisingly well - developed, and Wiig brings the character to vibrant and dynamic life on - screen. Despite the over-the-top antics shown in the trailer, the themes that the film explores are actually quite grounded. Wedding parties in films are also now so extravagantly realised that they have become a measure of success and social approval."
7464,"Beyond the props, flawless visual effects and startling CGI, the movie tries as well to inject its narrative with deeper subtexts. The Fights are well choreographed but they tend to be more stylish than practical and sometimes border on illogical. But as the duo soon discover, reports of the vampires' return have been greatly understated. From the dark cyberpunk inspired Church city to the post apocalyptic western towns dotting the hostile desert lands, great attention had been paid to make those places as believable as possible. There's a very well done animated prologue and stunning sets and photography of the apocalyptic plain field."
7465,"Performances from Gibson and Foster were excellent (as you would expect). The subplot, which was focused around Anton Yelchin was also interesting and kind of played hand and hand as the same situation that Walter was dealing with. Anton Yelchin (the new Scotty in Star Trek) is impressively grounded even as he suffers through some of his father's inherited symptoms and those typical of teens anyway. All the performances were very good. the characters are played to perfection, as Mel Gibson and Jodie Foster, who also directs the film, deliver memorable performances."
7466,"But of course you have to have Johnny Depp, because it wouldn't be PotC without him, and Geoffrey Rush was spectacular as always. The infamous addition of mermaids was the best part in the entire film. Quiet, suspenseful and culminating in a full - on action sequence, the mermaids constitute the one completely fresh element of the film. Brings everything from the classic bizarre comedy to the nail biting action scenes. But, since you have the legendary POTC appeal to bank upon, expectations will always be much higher, so you just can't afford to disappoint."
7493,"Giacchino usually does terrific work like with The Incredibles, Ratatouille, and Up. There were times in Cars 1 when it looked almost real. One of the most impressive sets, Tokyo, were already spoiled by the Tokyo Mater short. Spies and Cars seems to work well together. The look is impressive but not more than anything else Pixar's done."
7470,"Every image counts, each shot was taken care with competence and passion, each frame, each camera move - Lubezki has worked with Malick, IÃ±arritu, CuarÃ³n. Pure visual intuition, enhanced by Malick's intellectual background. Any release from Terence Malick is highly anticipated because, let's face it, "" prolific "" is not exactly his middle - name. Terence Malick's existential and experimental drama is truly something special. The funny thing is, the set - up is fairly quick: in 10 minutes you know what the deal is."
7471,"Yes, it is funny and there are indeed some standout moments. An amazing achievement given that Bangkok is a voyeurs dream. So the chances are very good that if you liked the first one, you will also enjoy this one. Especially when the first film grosses a half - billion dollars! After all, The Hangover made over 200 million dollars world wide, they are going to milk it for everything that it's worth."
7472,"All in all, it makes for a good Thursday or Friday night at the movies. The aliens them self are kind of cheesy, but scary in a funny way. A friend just said' you like sci - fi movies right? A reviewer from South Africa says, "" The dialogue was apparently authentic, but it sounded made up, like the droogs' language in A Clockwork Orange . "" The group kills the thing and take the body with them hoping to make a few squids out of the strange creature."
7473,"The movements are purposely jerky and quick. The movie has great scene and it has stupid moments. Feels very real - a very visceral intense experience that will definitely stay with you the next time you are taking a train. The acting is OK and the characters aren't just props and one dimensional buckets of blood running around screaming until they get killed. There is everything you would expect from "" real "" horror movie."
7475,"The backgrounds, and the setting are all very detailed and the complex movements of the characters are simply perfect. With ingenious methods, the actions scenes are executed. 3D is definitely worth it for experiencing this film. Even in serious scenes it suddenly has humor. Perhaps one of the strongest aspects about this movie is the balance of story, action, and detail."
7476,"Xmen: First Class is simply fantastic. The performances in First Class are first rate. With these definite plot developments looming, their eventuation is bound to be a bit of an anti-climax. Xmen first Class is really very good. Overall First Class makes you think of the Sean Connery Bond movies and the reboot of Star Trek (2009)."
7480,"little kids having adventures, growing up and falling in love. After being disappointed by a series of recent movies, this one was refreshing and heart - fluttering. Save yourself 2 hours of life and 8 bucks and do anything else. From the actor's performance perspective; Elle Fanning's performance was breath - taking, and she saved some scenes. As an homage to the Spielberg films of the 80's, this movie succeeds."
7482,"Green Lantern is unpretentious, probably even one of the most unpretentious superhero movies ever made. Overall everyone tries their best and at the end of the day do a really great job, certainly no Oscar worthy performances, though. Kids will enjoy it, but adults likely will not. Hector Hammond was well portrayed by Peter Saarsgard (though it lacked a proper finish) 7. Oa was beautiful, just a couple notches below Asgard in Thor."
7484,"The casting was brilliant and even Jim Carrey, Angelina Lansbury and Jeffrey Tambor did great at their performances. Yes, they included one of the major star comedians, Jim Carrey. Mr. Popper's Penguins, though, filled the bill nicely. It was so rushed while everything else in this movie turned out great. It is worth a watch for Jim Carrey's interaction with the adorable penguins."
7485,"Phyllis Smith is an adorable and strange addition to the movie as the confused Lynn Davis, bringing her own brand of corkiness to the plot. When Elizabeth meets the substitute teacher Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake), she discovers that he is very rich and she flirts with him. Further, she learns that Scott likes big breasts and she decides to have a surgery of silicone - implant. If you are into dark comedies or a raunchy brand of humor, you will find yourself laughing with this one. This comedy is one of the greats, it pulls no punches and has it all."
7486,"The photography is fantastic and the 3d technology is used effectively to create stunning, visually amazing scenes. Since Bay actually filmed these scenes in the latest and greatest 3D technology, it was admittedly pretty amazing to watch. The Decepticons, completely aware of this discovery, make an immediate power play and the war is back, bigger than ever. Scenes of Chicago buildings being toppled and destroyed can be as spectacular and brain - numbing as those of September 11; and the wing - suit flying sequences are breath - taking. Epic Autobot / Decepticon fight scenes and amazing transforming sounds."
7487,"She nails the character, Mrs. Tainot, beautifully. If you enjoyed Forest Gump, you'd most likely enjoy this one - even if the feel - goodness sets in slightly more subtly. Hanks and Roberts were simply great but the whole cast did an impressive job and George Takei as the economics lecturer, Dr. Matsutani, was absolutely hilarious. While the plot itself is no great shakes, it's very interesting, especially in these times of disheavelment. Larry Crowne (Tom Hanks), a middle aged man, who works at U-mart, and loves life and his job."
7488,"It's pure entertainment, the dialogs are sometimes taken from a porn movie. Its mainly because the cast is very likable with its main leads resonating off each other in this pool of silliness which makes the film highly entertaining. It really could have died on its ass for being so ambitious but in the hands of a craftsman like David Gordon Green it works wonders. Having said all of the above, there were clearly some pacing issues and missed opportunities for this to be an even funnier and smarter movie but as it is, it offers plenty of entertainment, fun and laughs for a Friday / Saturday evening at the cinema. While James Franco and Danny McBride provides the laughter and brotherly banter, Natalie Portman strides in with stunning gravitas as a deceptive sexy swashbuckling heroine."
7490,"Too Big to Fail achieves a rare feat for talky dramas: it sustains acute tension for ninety full minutes, never slowing down and never climaxing prematurely. All animals are equal But some animals are more equal than others. The performances in the film are spot on especially that of William Hurt as treasury secretary Henry Paulson and veteran Paul Giamatti as fed chair Ben Bernanke. The film is almost comical in its representation of Paulsen, Bernanke and Geithner. Director Curtis Hanson is true to form in this film as it was adapted from Andrew Ross Sorkin's book of the same name."
7492,"Keep an eye on this one, as it is one of the best summer surprises in recent years. Every so often you can even catch a slight hint in Spacey's eyes that he's enjoying himself. Most of the fun goes to the performances. Jennifer Aniston very outside her standard girly role, and it was awesome. Lots of twists and turns in this surprising comedy."
7495,"You do get to be a fly on the wall, and during these scenes, it's good stuff. This is a fascinating film that covers a lot of ground in only 92 minutes. Intimidating as it inspires, Page One pushes cameras into one of the highest - pressure environments around and captures a few human moments in the midst of empire - cleaving times. Mr. Carr is a hardened reporter with the spectacular ability to cut directly through to the important point and focus on the details, verify those details, and then summarize in a concise, understandable manner. The advances in the internet have essentially done away with the idea of a Deep Throat."
7496,"As made for TV movies go, this was very good. He used some good moves behind the lens without getting crazy. This movie is so hilarious and exciting from the first seconds right to the last frame. Sometimes it is amusing but it is never hilarious; sometimes it has action but it is never exciting; it just tends to have a little bit of everything to make it passable for those willing to go along with it. Two examples are how Sam says "" flaming sword "" instead of "" burning sword "" for his interpretation of "" ardiente espada "", and when the subtitles display "" thank you "" when he says "" gracious bandidos ""."
7500,They're some of the most interesting & touching scenes of the story. * ** SPOILERS ** THE GOOD: Snape's and Voldemort's characters were played quite well. A few additional scenes and extending a few of them just a little more could have added greater depth and emotion. Snape's memories are rushed and they take out some of the most interesting memories. This would have shown Snapes greater respect and love for him.
7501,"And it's one of the best movies of 2011. It is a picture perfect reflection of the films from the late 60's , 70's and 80's. Refn's masterpiece and one of the best films of 2011. Some powerful performances, stylish direction and intricate plotting complete this strangely understated production. Once the picture starts, your eyes are literally glued to the screen."
7502,"Everything was portrayed swiftly, without padding, The plot was very well thought out. It grounded the film and made everything play out in a more real world tone with real consequences. That could work well in some movies, but a 1940s - style adventure of this sort just cries out for a happy ending. Silvestri's score is the best superhero score in years. The joys and the thrills mostly goes to the performances."
7503,"Steve Carell continues to get better. Acting wise, the film delivers in spades. It celebrates movies like Say Anything Great performances from the whole cast, including a surprisingly refreshing change for Steve Carell. It has tremendous heart and charisma and it's so very easy to get caught up in to the lives of these characters."
7504,"It's as beautifully made as it is acted and the locations are exquisite. It was fresh and witty and everything you hope a movie will be. It's not the typical script of "" everything's all good - obstacle - everything ends well "" - there's a lot more complexity which makes it realistically genuine. Her acting was great and you can really see her changing as the years progress. And of course there is Anna Hathaway - suitably rumpled and grunge in the first half, and elegance and grace personified in the second, when she flashes her pearly whites, the world seems to be a better place to live."
7505,"Brendan Gleeson is usually natural, making the character he plays fit like a glove â€” whether the robust and humorous loyal buddy and the warrior, as in "" Braveheart "" (1995), or a quiet and subdued aspiring politician, as in "" Gangs of New York "" (2002), or a non-supportive father, civil war volunteer - turned - deserter, as in "" Cold Mountain "" (2003), whether the gentle, mentoring, culture - exploring hit man in hiding, as in "" In Bruges "" (2008), or on the other side of the law, the grouchy police sergeant with defiant, often dissident sense of humour (provocative in one - liners like "" being FBI, don't you prefer to fight unarmed women and children Michael McDonagh is the brother of one of the funniest writers in the world just now. But, what makes it the best is its protagonists' performances. B. Gleeson is just amazing and seeing Don Cheadle having a role where he is actually acting is a treat in itself too. If an English MP can find the film enjoyable and recommend it to her 35 , 000 + twitter followers, then no - one should complain."
7506,"This is probably the best Disney film in years. Even the "" scariest "" scenes won't freak out the little ones, and everything is so calm, so tender, and so unobtrusive it's wonderful. It goes back to everything that made Disney so great when they started off. They capture the sense of Milne's original and translate it into array of frames brilliantly. Even at an incredibly short sixty - nine minutes, (minus, maybe, five from the beginning short) Winnie the Pooh is lovely, crafty, and limitless."
7507,"It's a pretty common theme that's been done dozens of times before. The performances by the entire cast are amazing. The movie could use some more suspense in the last 20 minutes of it, and a better first scene. Lucky McKee directs with a sure hand, mixing jolting savagery with cruel, calculating drama and a few moments of affecting dreamlike melancholia, although the film does get somewhat melodramatic and the intense finale goes into feverish pulp territory slightly unsuited to the mostly just disturbing bulk of the film, things are always surely handled. The soundtrack is an important part of this, often using soft indie rock it works perfectly alongside the whitebread setting and in the way it underlines the travails of the children, but also makes a fine contrast to the nastier stuff."
7509,"The film is very aware of its origins with Peyo and respects that fact. They are enjoying playing around 3Ds. This has worked many times before, having produced such monumental box - office hits like "" Masters of the Universe "", "" The Neverending Story 3 "" and the record - breaking "" Howard the Duck "". Doogie Howser is perfectly likable as is his screen wife. On the other hand, where it is used the CGI is incredibly high - quality (i. e. the Smurfs, Gargamel's cat, etc.), and the special effects are designed more specifically for 3 - D viewing than in most movies as of late."
7511,"The film has it's ups, it has it's downs. In the end, Friends with Benefits is both surprisingly well done and unsurprisingly ordinary. Even though you know what is coming, the honesty with life's little quirks and human behavior was incredibly well done. He comes off as just okay, and more amateur than anything else. 5 * - Timberlake and Kunis are very good in the lead roles and the supporting cast is well put together."
7512,"Performance-Wise: Paul Rudd delivers his careers most lovable / convincing performance in here. Ned is a sweet idealist who believes the best about his fellow humans and rarely is disappointed. A fun ride throughout, the film only has a couple of weak spots. He's seen as an idiot by others (including his own family) but that's just because he's so trusting and loving of others. It's a nice little study on the cynicism and selfishness of today's culture and how someone with a good heart and a sunny disposition just gets taken advantage of and abused for being decent."
7515,"The baby twins of Justin Bateman were really funny & the scenes were a total surprise. So check your brains at the cinema door and just go with the absurdism. ' THE CHANGE - UP': Three Stars (Out of Five) It's not the 80's anymore and Hollywood is still making body changing movies! Jason Bateman's character Dave wakes up bright and early thanks to his newborn twins, one of which projectile poos all over his face. Leslie Mann (otherwise known as Mrs. Apatow) and Olivia Wilde co-star as the men's two love interests, one is Dave's wife and the other is his co-worker."
7516,"a deal that makes her eyes grow wide with happiness. It makes for some good comedic moments. Lovely performances makes this far too clean and neat story, not merely palatable but enjoyable. e. g. Will Smith, Halle Berry and Beyonce. This story takes place 50 years ago and director Tate Taylor does an admirable job of bringing Stockett's novel to the big screen."
7517,"First time screenwriter Michael Diliberti (previously credited as executive assistant to producer Scott Rudin) blunders his way past a great premise to lowest common denominator comedy. The best comedies cull humor from character flaws, and while the cast of 30 Minutes or Less has those to spare, human foibles have little bearing on the way these people behave. It's as if, in half the movies these days, and this is a perfect example of one, the writers have no clue as to how to write dialogue, so they decide to talk dirty for an hour and a half and call it good. There is a good cast here of actors who have had supporting roles or just a brief scene in big comedies over the past few years (Aziz Ansari and Nick Swardson in particular), who outside the comedy circuit aren't recognizable names yet. Even in a summer with little competition, Fleischer's film is light on laughs and even lighter on character."
7519,"Visually, the film has some above average production values. It might have the same theme as the first four movies, but unlike the first four, it's on a much higher scale. Deaths here are top notch, very blunt and very cringe worthy. Emma Bell is a bit better although she wasn't as good as she was in FROZEN. The last 5 minutes are almost worth the price of admission all alone."
7521,"Definitely a must see in 3D. It was consistent throughout, no eyestrain, very clean, and had some nice out - of - screen effects that paired well with the comedy. And for the most part the 3D is worth it and it actually plays a crucial part in the movie since the plot brings out and gives 3D scenarios. Excellent actor and it shows, Patton Oswalt is hilarious as expected and Amir from CollegeHumor is a great actor here as well. Yes, there was new characters and the 3D was new but they all worked so perfectly."
7523,"Also, Ms. Poots is an awesome screamer. His charisma and delight shines through all of his scenes. Luckily, things get back on track with a climax that's executed with a uniquely creepy wit, and a few good shocks and surprises. It is, without exaggeration, the first great entry in the long line of atrocious horror remakes. It is just the right mix of comedy, terror, suspense, terrific performances, and an affection for old - fashioned scares."
7524,"Hammer your expectations down through the rocks. It is about looking at a mirror image of one's self as opposed to assuming everything is perfect. A couple of other interesting notes include Kumar Pallana (The Royal Tenenbaums) as Purdeep. The acting is perfect, the camera - work perfectly beautiful, the plot deeply affecting with wonderful surprises. This movie is highly recommended if you enjoy simple movies like those."
7528,"Like all EuropaCorp films, production values are top - notch. The action scenes were very tight and exciting. Zoe Saldana is a star on the rise, she's strong, beautiful, intelligent and a decent actress. Action and sexy Zoe Saldana sells it all. Zoe Saldana gives a great physical performance and spends a great deal of time flitting in and out of vents and the various hits shown in the film are all quite cool."
7531,"It perfectly matches with all of the scenes. Aimee Teegarden and McDonell did really good job with their roles. Disney movies are known to be, well, "" Disney Clean . "" These funny, although weak, scenes gave the film a little more pace and took away from the drawn out drama. However, it is a cute, high school soap opera that will entertain those that like to see happy endings and smiles."
7532,"They have added a number of interviews and incorporated some fascinating archival footage to provide insights into the era. One of the most fascinating segments of the film was early on when they delved into how Kesey was turned onto LSD. Like most documentaries, this movie will be enjoyed best by those who were present during that era and by those who wish they were. Cassady was a real character, a speed - taking oddity who drove like a maniac and had zillions of stories to tell. Magic Trip is a well made and entertaining documentary that gives some insights into the burgeoning counter-cultural movement of the 60s."
7534,"The whole audience laughed out loud on many occasions. The film is very funny and has numerous laugh out loud moments, but the great thing is the spirit of the film. It would be a final send off to four of the funniest faces on TV. Oh, it definitely wasn't anything out of the ordinary or unpredictable, but just like the show, it's able to still be completely hilarious and really touching when it comes down to it. The film is meant to be a fair well to the guys after three very successful TV series and the lads go out in style."
7535,"Ms. July is a fabulous observer of life and people and personalities. but on the upside there are perhaps 10 moments of absolute beauty, each worth admission alone, and Miranda July is an open wound of a screen presence. Somehow they think society or the universe owes them something and just by dreaming big, their lives will be complete. Another excellent piece of casting is Joe Putterlik who plays the old man. "" The Future "" is an excellent, surreal, cold comedy in the tradition of the great Spike Jonze & Charlie Kaufman films "" Adaptation "", "" Being John Malkovich "" and the brain - blasting "" Synecdoche NY ""."
7536,"Like any great documentary, "" The Interrupters "" is a conversation starter. This touching memorials litter the blood - spattered streets of Chicago and are the remains of the day in The Interrupters, a powerful and disturbing documentary by the talented Steve James (Hoop Dreams). His work with a gangbanger named Flamo, who he comes into contact with at a serious boiling point, is one of the more powerful arcs in the film. Yet what truly makes The Interrupters the captivating, multi-layered documentary that it is is the way it conducts its subjects. Aesthetically, The Interrupters is extraordinary, with several long - shots of the crisp, yet crumbling Chicagoland area."
7537,"It's impressively shot by Dave Klein and Smith shows flickers of there being a good director in the mix. The constant use of hand held cameras and creative cutting, keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. The movie also features one of the best endings ever. From Westboro to Waco, stopping briefly for a night in a Hostel, Red State is not easily forgotten once sampled. Goodman gives the other great performance of the film as the ATF agent stuck between a rock and a hard place."
7538,"All seen in a million other comedies, most of them better than this one. Kate (Sarah Jessica Parker), is happily married to her husband (Greg Kinnear), and has two great kids. Stay awake until 3 every morning making imaginary lists in your head for things to do. Women are capable, special creatures, with their own, unique purpose in the world--not in a "" women are less than men and are here to cook and clean "" type of way, but in a "" the world would be poorer without what women bring to the table "" way. It is wryly amusing and observant occasionally, but there should be lots and lots more of that, the paucity of observation and the safe boundaries means it fails to create anything other than a very safe film that is mostly trite."
7540,"The T and A is still plentiful, and the film is actually surprisingly graphic in some instances. The people they had cast for the various roles actually did good jobs, and that was the main thing that "" Shark Night "" had working for it. But the majority of deaths, the best part of any slasher film, are merely hinted at. Like "" Piranha 3D "", which it tries to be, it opens up with someone getting killed, then opens up to an upbeat tune. Surely the special effects team realized they were working on an actual movie with a budget, and not some straight - to - DVD Asylum knockoff."
7541,"Soderbergh takes a very minimalist approach to Contagion, steering clear of anything flashy or exaggerated and avoiding over-dramatic relationships and big budget set pieces. At times having famous faces in tiny roles was a little distracting but mostly it worked and it totally avoided the sense of old celebrity pals hanging out together at having fun together â€“ a feeling these celebrity heavy films often can have. What makes this film so compelling is the way Soderbergh is able to show how unhygienic human beings are and how easy it is to create a pandemic. If you're smart, you know how most of the world would handle it, most people would turn into animals while the rich would benefit off the death of others. Anyway, go and see the film â€“ it's a thought provoking and scary chiller that taps into the current zeitgeist."
7542,"He portrays all of the character traits with such versatility and charisma. Moneyball is just an excellent film. It is so well directed, so superbly acted, and Sorkin and Zaillian's script is practically flawless. Overall, Moneyball is your typical crowd pleaser, but it is incredibly high quality. Hill and Hoffman especially play perfect compliments to Pitt's sunny exterior."
7545,"Peter Guillam, Colin Firth, Toby Jones, Mark Strong, and John Hurt are all terrific as well. The casting, the setting, the filming, the editing, the soundtrack, everything about this film is just perfect. He does so much with minor reactions and movements and he is a great character. Everyone gives strong performances and everyone seems to understand what Alfredson is doing. The performances are just great, Gary Oldman steals the show."
7546,"It also manages to perfectly balance the plights of several protagonists. The genius of Asghar Farhadi's story is that it piles on the tension and drama without resorting to fireworks, trickery or shock and awe plot effects. And the story goes through those problems and makes a full round circle back to the separation of Simin from Nader. Asghar Farhadi's new film after the ingenious' About Elly' is running for the Golden Bear at this year's Berlin Film Festival and, with half of the competition done and the rest of the program not looking too promising, appears to be an almost inevitable winner. It is so well - crafted; the twists of the plot throw up new moral dilemmas for all the protagonists, which are explored sensitively and without judgement - so refreshingly unlike mainstream American films."
7547,"Some of the most scintillating moments of "" A Dangerous Method "" are sexually bracing. Events that should be important are skimmed over and not explained; to be honest, it doesn't particularly seem like anything of real importance happens in the film. As far as the two leading male actors (Fassbender and Mortensen, who by the way was so good in both Cronenberg "" A History of Violence "" and "" Eastern Promises ""), they were as good as they could possibly be, but in the end they both failed to impress, move, or even raise any sort of emotion beyond boredom. Although Keira Knightley tried her best to portray Sabina Spielrein, there were certain scenes where her delivery seemed pushed. Several of the dialogue - driven scenes sizzle with a sexual intensity, but when matters are actually taken to the bedroom they are hit with a dullness that would be impossible to believe came from Cronenberg if he didn't have his name stamped on it."
7548,"One of the best iv ever seen. Nick Nolte in particular did a fantastic job with his role and will have you nearly in tears. With a star studded cast and top notch acting, the performances were solid and believable. The fight scenes were done really well. It is perfectly logical to point out that Brendan had hard fights to get to the final and that he would probably have been exhausted and that Tommy has had a much easier route."
7549,"There are two really excellent exchanges between Gosling and Hoffman. All the film's amenities, from sets, costumes, and camera work, are also nice. Indeed, Morris is handsome, smart, and appears to speak sincerely and clearly to potential voters. In terms of these latter qualities the film does deliver but it is just a shame that it is not as good as it looks in regards the former. This is particularly true of the performances he draws from the cast, with Gosling, Hoffman, Giamatti, Tomei, Clooney himself, and especially Wood giving great turns."
7550,"It flows logically from everything that's happened before, and still it comes as a surprise. Gradually the low - key family realism gives way to a realism of a far nastier kind, coupled with sudden moments of real mystery and total surprise. Thank goodness for Film4 who are showing a season of British cinema. Wheatley layers the non-action with skill, and really knows how to ratchet up the intrigue. This is not gore for gore's sake, this is brutal, dark and realistic violence that adds to the disturbing mood this movie sets."
7551,"The motion picture was professionally directed by Gary McKendry, though has ups and downs. Interesting screenplay by Matt Sherring plenty of twists and turns, being inspired by the book "" The Feather Men "" written by Sir Ranulph Fiennes, this was an English adventurer, polar explorer and former SAS man is the author of The Feather Men, the novel from which this film is adapted. This is a slick, stylish enough film, that carries off it's various action sequences and tense moments with the requisite style and aplomb, even if it doesn't generate the amount of suspense it could have and the whole thing does feel a tad disjointed and sporadic. Holding true to it's claim of being a story spinning all round the globe, Killer Elite literally dashes with hyperactive energy from the deserts of the Middle East to the Australian outback, to European cities like Paris and London, all the while holding it's accolade of being a true story. This moving picture contains thrills, unstoppable action, betrayal, fighting, car pursuits and lots of deaths, as it has a great body count : 21."
7552,"That's what JGL does here and that's why "" 50/50 "" succeeds. The shifts feel completely natural between moments of deep sentiment and moments of levity. He does a fantastic job expressing the feelings of calm fortitude as well as isolation. 50/50 has pretty much everything an amazing movie like this can offer. Levine coaxes brilliant and thoughtful performances out of his actors."
7555,"Everything about this film is exceptional. There's an evocative score, an imaginative use of silence, wonderful locations and costume. The period detail is outstanding: film stocks, tints, (heck even the frame weave), captions and montage are all on the money. Jean Dujardin deserved his Palme D'or for his captivating and wonderful performance. The direction displays such self - assurance, and treats the audience with such respect, that it is almost like having a dialogue with the director."
7572,"Fassbender's performance is complex and truly believable. Along with Fassbender is Mulligan, another one of today's rising stars. Fassbender knows that his character is truly disturbed. Like Fassbender, she gives her all for the role, exposing her true colors. Fassbender is stunning as Brandon, magnetizing the audience from the beginning all the way to the end."
7557,"It had some great comedy moments. It had some great plot twists, it had a real story line. Hugh Jackman, Evangeline Lilly and Dakota Goyo all have great performances. The move has a perfect blend of emotions, Robo - fight (very Importantly not over done) and some comic scenes, what else do you want? Have been following Huge Jackman's movies off late and all have them have been good including this one."
7558,"He has overcome childhood obstacles to make the world a better place. Overall it was a solid, informative documentary that really snatches the viewer into a world that, if one happens to not be familiar with would be happy to learn about. A more creative or dynamic approach would have been appreciated â€” think National Geographic or NFL Films. 8/10 Informativeness 5/10 Cinematography 6/10 Interviews 2/10 Breadth of Info presented 9/10 Depth of Info presented 5/10 Replay Value Buck proves to be as enlightening and disarmingly satisfying a documentary as you will find. This is an inspirational man who is making a difference in the lives of people and horses."
7559,"This is so true of this version of Footloose. It was nice to see actual dancers playing dancers . > The original Footloose at least had the benefit of being a film with a contemporary issue to its time and the appeal of its lead, Kevin Bacon. Kenny Wormald was a great choice for the dancing scenes. they are great actors and amazing dancers."
7560,"For the material they were given, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Joel Edgerton do a fine job. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is very good in this. There are some very well designed monsters. This puts a major obligation on the shoulders of the film to be highly imaginative and original in its own way. And there are also several key moments that needed to occur in order to keep in tune with the continuity."
7561,"The best thing about it was the performances. And finally, both contain outstanding performances from their cast. Superb writing and gritty direction; performances better yet and Colman delivers on every level. Mr. Considine is able to realise, thanks to a perfect script and superb actors, a small masterpiece and a perfect debut. Her performance here is definitely going to propel her into the upper echelons of British acting - if she is not already there."
7562,"Truly there is an inversely proportional relationship between the number of plaudits received and the quality of the movie and this sucks big time. So also not a good movie if you like to watch films in bed and / or when someone is sleeping in the room next door. Elizabeth Olsen does a helluva job as Martha, giving her dewey eyed complexity, both bewilderment, shock, disgust, and intrigue. The sex scenes were well done and messed up. The redeeming qualities: John Hawkes is amazing."
7563,"The sequencing of opening shots in most scenes allows a strong sense of atmosphere to develop even before the characters have entered the scene or dialogue has even commenced. In general the film does carry a strong and unsettling momentum until the final credits. One of the most interesting facets of the film was that it showed how much power children can hold and execute over adults if they are given the opportunity. As with many psychopaths, his above average intelligence makes him even more dangerous. With some sections brilliantly gripping and others making you wish away the remainder of the film."
7564,"The musketeers as the title heroes really should be at the centre of the plot, but in this movie Milady and Buckingham got much more attention. For a period piece set in the 17th century, costumes, props and sets seem to be convincing. Alexandre Dumas's source for his novel was a book by 19th - century writer Courtils de Sandraz, which was purporting to be D'Artagnan's biography; the Musketeers were actually real people, not fictional characters created by Dumas. W. S. Anderson has unwisely sacrificed an engaging and all time favorite work of fiction for a very expensive piece of cannon fodder. It's a nice rendition from the immortal novel with pretty budget and breathtaking scenarios."
7565,"As others have said, the idea of this movie was excellent. As with Niccol's other films, the cinematography is beautiful. None of the scenes seem original or well executed. The best actor in the film, had to be Cillain Murphy. Amanda Seyfried, whose role has her playing off Timberlake for a lot of the film, is another professional whose appeal tends to overshadow her abilities for some reason."
7566,"Both Ruffalo and Linney turn in excellent work. This script was in process for many years (and exhibits the associated constipation). The cast boasts Anna Paquin (of True Blood fame), Hollywood heavyweight Matt Damon, Jean Reno from Leon and Matthew Broderick. Nothing in the material world satisfies Lisa; nothing can match her aspirations. Like most of Ruffalo's characters, his Terry is a quiet, sexily melancholic guy."
7567,"That said, though, the performances were spectacular. Winslet had a great metamorphosis as too chic investment banker. Roman Polanski got his hands on some of the most talented actors like Jodie Foster, Kate Winslet, Christoph Walts and John C. Reilly. With the exception of the prologue and the epilogue, the whole film is developed in only one location, and it basically relies on the dialogs and the performances. And the funniest thing is that they all try to be objective when it's totally impossible."
7568,"A great cast with splendid performances. Bettany, Quinto, and Badgley, all turned in superb performances, but it was Tucci, Spacey, and Irons that stood out as excellent. Everyone from Zachary Quinto to Demi Moore brings their A-game. If you're a film buff (and enjoy great performances) or you've been in finance, this is a must - see. Others may see it as more examples of greed and hubris."
7569,"The greatest improvement of this movie over the other movies is probably the pacing. The story is not anything new though but the execution is decent. Like any grab bag, not everything inside is interesting. There are also some clever shots and effects (Scenes with the oscillating camera are ingenious at times). Probably the single most brilliant technical addition to the Paranormal Activity repertoire is the oscillating camera."
7570,"With a solid balance of story, dialogue, action and humour ,' Johnny English Reborn' is a terrific sequel. The other performances are pretty spot on. Frankly speaking, this movie is a vast improvement over the first one, with heightened unpredictability and more genuine gags. Quite the contrary; Johnny English Reborn is an amazing movie that entertains all ages. It had lots of funny moments."
7571,"They are always a joy to have and see in movies. When looking at one website, they see a child that looks remarkably similar to Nathan. As an unapologetic actioner, it should be expected that Abduction possesses some of the clunky dialogue clichÃ©s associated with the genre. The first claims to be the CIA, and is led by Alfred Molina, while the second is a bunch of Russian guys led by Michael Nyqvist. Not even veteran stars like Isaacs, Bello, Molina, Nyqvist and Sigourney Weaver (who plays Nathan's psychologist) can redeem this at - best made - for - TV thriller that tries to be the younger version of the Bourne series."
7924,"Do yourself and your loved ones a favor. There are two important, but opposing forces, at work in most humans. It's interesting to see the contrasts and it may well give some inspiration for your own life. By illustrating those who have achieved happiness as well as those who have not, the movie could potentially be very useful in helping young people make responsible and fulfilling life choices. The film is a good mixture of human examples in the real world, and researchers explaining their findings."
7573,"For once Anna Faris has snagged a role that shows her talent (and fingernails - on - the - blackboard voice) and she looks terrific. It's a lot of fun, and puts some sizzle into the shizzle by giving it a little bit more sexyback than most. The dialogues were funny and awkward, the music was pretty fresh and the cast was great, and Faris was surprisingly good in this one. Tuck in the always reliable Blythe Danner and Ed Begley, Jr and this is a cast worth an evening's outing. Not the classic perfect catch man of these type of movies, which is breath of fresh air."
7574,"You do feel he will never survive - and this takes you right to the penultimate scenes. Headhunters is, in a sense, typically Scandinavian - stark, brooding and with as much silence as dialogue. Its a rock - solid story filled with deception and turnovers. Perhaps the film could be faulted for showing only two types of Norwegians: rich sophisticates and yokels (all blond of course). The acting was top notch from the 2 main actors, Aksel Hennie and Nikolaj Coaster - Waldau (who you may know as Jaime Lannister from Game of Thrones)."
7575,"Ben McKenzie is generally good and emotive, if in need of more charisma in places. All voices sound top notch without sounding as if they're actors reading off a script in a sound booth. Purists would cry foul at the tweaks but they never detract from the original artwork's feel; it is still dark, gritty, and atmospheric as ever. its like 3 pages in a comic book last much longer and make a much bigger impression than a few minutes in film. It is David Mazzucchelli's original comic designs and characters, combined with an Asian anime flaire and aesthetics."
7576,"The filmmaking is good enough and everything is large. It's still enjoyable to watch in the big screen and 3D. But this is the greatest moment and nails the entire film as a contender for becoming a classic. More adventures to this kitty cat could be fun. Here's the thing, cats are adorable and their instincts are funny."
7577,"But, very few are actually smart and slick enough like an' Italian Job' or an' Oceans Eleven'. It is actually very entertaining and the performances from the entire cast are solid. The film is largely designed to be a crowd pleaser and largely fulfils that role admirably http: / / julesmoviereviews. You know how it all ends: the smart thieves get their booty despite all odds and twists. Alan Alda makes for a good slimy villain, and Ben Stiller, Eddie Murphy, and Matthew Broderick (as well as their co-stars) make a likable bunch of people with a goal that you hope they will be able to reach."
7578,"Christopher Shyer, who plays Richard Nixon in a brief scene, has the least - effective verisimilitude of anyone who has played the man in a motion picture. The "" old "" make - up was worthy of a B picture of the 50's. No, this is more of a fat - free character study that hits only a few of the highlights from an enigmatic man's fascinating career. J. Edgar Hoover was a very private, secretive and ambitious man who was totally dedicated to his job. In his inner circle was Helen Gandy (Naoimi Watts), his personal secretary and keeper of Hoover's private files."
7579,""" The Double, "" is a taut spy - thriller with echoes of the Cold War and "" The Day of the Jackal . "" Here it relies more on action and some surprises. Yes, occasionally he shows up in a fairly good movie like Hachiko or Unfaithful, but then the superior performances are from other actors (Diane Lane, in that particular case). Overall this is a decent and entertaining production for which you have to keep expectations low on all levels in order to enjoy it. Topher Grace as the (supposedly brilliant) rookie FBI Agent is seriously miscast, while Richard Gere needs to ditch the action genre."
7597,"Appropriately then, the film has been nominated for Best Picture honours - though amongst the nine nominees this year, this is probably the lowest rated overall by critics. Daldry also gets an excellent performance from von Sydow - with wordless shrugs and sighs, he effortlessly conveys his character's troubled past, one so traumatising that he has chosen to remain silent and relate to others with a simple' yes' on one palm and' no' on the other. Thinking that it might be one of his father, Thomas' (Tom Hanks), elaborate puzzles he used to concoct in order to force his son to interact with people, Oskar sets off on a personal quest to track down the source of the key. Bullock is uncharacteristically low - key but very effective in the role, her heartbreak keenly felt through her grimaces and tears. No stranger to heavy - handed dramas, director Stephen Daldry (his fourth feature after the critically acclaimed' Billy Elliot' ,' The Hours' and' The Reader') handles the potentially histrionic proceedings with surprising deftness."
7580,"Even the opening credits look fantastic! The voice casting is collectively brilliant with Bell and Serkis being the obvious standouts. That's quite true if you consider that even the opening credits are little shining pearls of direction and creativity. It is fun, packed with adventure and action, enjoyable at all ages. The characters, scenery and landscapes all look incredible and so creative."
7581,"What emerges is a picture of a self - effacing man, a consummate professional who approached everything he did with passion. There is plenty of information during the first part about the Beatles and their early years in the red light district of Berlin at the start of the 60's, the overwhelming success of the band, and the creative tensions that eventually led to the split. Also, there are some major omissions, of which the Cloud 9 album is the most notable. Even Frank Sinatra called Harrison's Something one of the greatest love songs written. Scorsese draws upon a wealth of photographs, rarely seen archival footage, home videos, diary entries, and interviews to round out this picture of a gentle, humble, artistic man eternally searching for inner peace."
7582,"And he's right on both fronts. It should be very well received just on the 3D alone. ChloÃ« Grace Moretz, also gives a fine and respectable performance. Best Picture Nomination for sure, and quite possibly others. One last note on the use of 3D."
7583,"What makes this movie interesting is the performances. Some of the reveals are a pleasant surprise, others leave you scratching your head. However, it is nice that they tried to do something different. Cage taps into his subtlety - something he rarely does these days - which helps the tension and uneasiness of the atmosphere build until he finally bursts (on more than one occasion). It's only 90 minutes, and if you're a fan of Nicolas Cage, you'll surely get at least some enjoyment from Trespass."
7584,"The quality of the fight scenes was great. The visuals are absolutely beautiful and the fight scenes are a lot of fun. The first 5 minutes of this movie are probably the most exciting of the hole movie. Well done fight scenes, stylized blood, gorgeous Frieda Pinto and Gods. This film arrived a year after IM2 and Rourke really chews the scenery here."
7585,"Especially given Swardson's stellar performance in Just Go With It. Funny People and Just Go With It were awesome movies! If you have seen the trailer, you have seen any and all even remotely noteworthy moments from this otherwise act of tedium. He is an amazing actor with amazing credits to his name. Jack is a highly successful director of television commercials."
7586,"It's beautifully directed by Joachim Trier and photographed by Jakob Ihre. Honest, reflective, insightful, and intimate, Oslo, August 31st is a powerful and unforgettable achievement and Lie's performance is towering. The soft - focus cinematography (Jakob Ihre) works well with a particularly engaging sound design which, along with very conscious direction, editing and general production design, makes for technically masterful cinema with an aesthetic that is both selectively minimal and enjoyably rich. Some are pleasant while others are indifferent, but all of them are vivid, strong, and deeply personal. The interview goes well and Anders responses are articulate and quite insightful and the employer seems impressed."
7596,"The three kids have pretty funny and interesting personalities and habits. The best way to conclude The Sitter is to say that it is a good comedy for young adults or above. Relief turns back into aggravation and, more than anything else, you just want it to end. If you have seen the far - superior "" Adventures in Babysitting "" (1987) with Elisabeth Shue, then you know the basic premise. Being an eternal child at heart, Jonah's connection to his ward's problems feels perfectly natural and, in certain ways, touching to a degree."
7587,"Seven years later, he finally returns, and with The Descendants, he returns with a bang. The Descendants (2011) Wow, lots of great sharp close - ups of George Clooney. Like Sideways, his screenplay (co-written by Nat Faxon and Jim Rash) nails the tone right on the head. However, director Alexander Payne does an amazing job of keeping everything level. Which is often just a hair short of the breathtaking stuff others pull off at their best."
7588,"Jason Segal so utterly dominates the film that the Muppets themselves are reduced to mere cameo performances in the film. These would include Jack Black, Mickey Rooney, Alan Arkin, Neil Patrick Harris, Sarah Silverman, Whoopi Goldberg, John Krasinski, Selena Gomez, Zach Galifianakis, Rico Rodriguez, Jim Parsons, Judd Hirsh, Emily Blunt, and Dave Grohl. The Muppets had everything spot on â€“ it was clever, entertaining, adorable, heartwarming, and absolutely hilarious. Jason Segel and Amy Adams are perfectly corny in this, but it works here, because it's the muppets! Jason Segel with his obvious and undying love for the Muppets is, by all accounts, the most deserving person to be given creative control of the Muppets since Jim Henson himself."
7589,"Breaking Dawn Part 1 thankfully takes its time with (most of) the important moments from the book. Some Cullens who aren't Edward get a bit more dialogue than usual (Elizabeth Reaser as Esme is probably the most happy about this). After watching Rise of the Planet of the Apes, the CG werewolves look like they were rendered in 1991. As well as the choices of music used, something else these films have always done right is remain true to the source material, including (most of) the important dialogue / moments from the books. Billy Burke and Sarah Clarke as Bella's parents get some great moments, both emotional and humorous."
7590,"Jeremy Irvine, Peter Mullan, David Thewlis, Benedict Cumberbatch, Niels Arestrup and Tom Hiddleston form the principal cast and are wonderful. The rest of the cast, Emily Watson, Peter Mullan, David Thewlis, Tom Hiddleston, etc were all great, as well. The battle scenes are detailed and exciting. Jeremy Irvine's performance was acceptable for an actor fairly new to the game, as were the performances of the gamut of child actors in the film, but honorable mentions must go to Emily Watson, Niels Arestrup, and Peter Mullan. The performances of the horses in this movie are impressive."
7591,"His writing can repel and enchant with equal measure and has a breakneck spontaneity which is rivaled by its frazzled incoherency. The depth you might expect and want here is slim, however, even though all the pieces are in play for a great drama--a charming troubled writer in a land filled with prejudice and violence and great natural beauty. There is a true surface here that's pretty amazing--the cars, the low down rot of the apartments, the racism between the rich white Americans and the indigenous Puerto Ricans. The film is defiantly worth watching in terms of its originality as well as the comical moments and strong storyline. The language still reeks of his Gonzo fury writing and manages to transport the audience into a drunken rant, as well as secretly educating them on the struggles of a free press."
7592,"But both Kenneth Branagh and Michelle Williams did admirable jobs. At the very least, it was an very entertaining and moving night at the movies. The vulnerability, the mannerisms, the voice - all were pitch perfect. Williams' performance is bolstered by impeccable turns by an enviable roster of the creamiest cream of British talent: Judi Dench, Kenneth Branagh, ZoÃ« Wanamaker, Eddie Redmayne and Emma Watson. Judi Dench is a hoot as Dame Sibyl Thorndike and Kenneth Brannagh has his moments."
7593,"There are some wonderful scenes cinematically as well. Weekend is everything that is brilliant about British Independent Cinema delightfully packaged into one film. Weekend catches the little moments of life beautifully and it finds beauty in the everyday. Besides the fact that the script was well - written, the actors carried the story to fruition in their slightest of gestures, glances, and articulations. It's all there in tiny details, there is never a moment when you don't utterly believe what goes on in his heart, it's all there in his eyes and the most subtle shifts of expression."
7598,"The character designs are asymmetric and the surface textures are realistic yet bold. A good Christmas film to add to the ranks. This generation of Santa is advanced technology and complex mission operations leveraging GPS and NORAD databases. From Steve's perspective that is a 10 sigma error, within the parameters of mission success. The film opens with a bravura set piece showing how Santa is able to stop in millions of homes in one night."
7599,"Throughout, Fletcher imbues striking compositions with symbolism while gracefully moving through a myriad of tones and genres. Bledel and Ronan look like a young Zooey Deschanel and Lindsey Lohan and interact with each other with a believable innocence. There are many levels to the story - without giving anything away - and it can be enjoyed on several levels. The teenage assassins are delightfully ruthless yet - at least at times - also endearingly vulnerable. The dialogue in the film is witty, whimsical and complex, reminiscent of the banter from classics of the Hollywood Golden Age such as His Girl Friday combined with the existential questioning of a Godard film."
7606,"This is perfect entertainment and No disappointments. Too be honest, it is absolutely one of the best movies of this year. Noomi Rapace is a nice flavor as Madam Sim. With powerful performances from the cast, this film is one not to be missed in this movie season. Final Verdict: "" A Game of Shadows "" is a stylish, fast - paced, yet comedic adventure which improves upon its predecessor in several aspects, and surely a highly recommended film."
7609,"And Charlize Theron does a wonderful job supplementing Jason Reitman's vision. The chemistry between Theron and Oswalt is brilliant. That said, it's worth watching, though probably a bit depressing for many viewers. Even the most melodramatic events would be presented with a light and refreshing approach in his movies. Charlize Theron is quite good and makes the most of the script she has to work with."
7610,"Performers like De Niro are worthy of a solid script and something more important to do rather than just stand around holding a theoretical sign saying' And Robert De Niro'. Leaving the hospital and into the hottest party in town, there's food caterer Laura (Katherine Heigl) who has to contend with rock star Jensen (Jon Bon Jovi) who is trying his utmost to win her back after walking out on her a year ago, with tired comedy contributed by her chefs played by Sofia Vergara and Russell Peters. Garry Marshall continues from his festival theme film Valentine's Day with yet another ensemble that rounds up some of the hottest folks in Hollywood, playing caricatures in 8 short stories that you know will link up one way or another, either through characters or through events. After his last holiday - themed box - office smash Valentine's Day in 2010, director Garry Marshall has carbon - copied the exact same formula for his latest film New Year's Eve which uses its gigantic ensemble cast to document various different relationships and states of emotions over the course of a single day and night in New York City. The film also has some bizarre cast members, including the incredibly pointless Jon Bon Jovi who slinks about, and may as well be promoting a new Greatest Hits album when he enters the frame."
7611,"The performances were generally good all around. The cinematography was excellent and one of the best in years. Its definitely worth seeing in theaters, and owning on DVD / BluRay. The action scenes and all the moves are spectacular. The fight scenes were done very well, incredibly brutal and realistic looking."
7612,"Their beautiful and natural moments on screen are as breath taking as they are tear - jerking. Still, there is genuine feeling in every scene, and Crowe's choice of music (a mix of oldies with more contemporary tunes) as well as JÃ³nsi's (of Icelandic cult band Sigur RÃ³s) eclectic score works perfectly in complementing the mood of the film. Lastly, Benjamin's two kids ages 14 and 7, were done quite well. A couple of their scenes together are the best in the film for acting and realistic dialogue. Lastly it's a story about maintaining good relationships with your family and those around you."
7613,"Noomi Rapace is a far better fit for Lisbeth than Rooney Mara. But, the dropping of the "" Kalle Bloomkvist "" nickname that was so prominent in the books is curious. The most touching scenes of the film come from the characters themselves, this is a character driven story and none are more powerful than Lisbeth and Mikeal themselves. She perfectly embodies everything you think of when you think of a strong female lead and has an unpredictability and edge to her that is exciting to watch. It's also true whether Lisbeth is played on screen by Noomi Rapace (Swedish films) or Rooney Mara."
7614,"Hasn't been a box office hit or getting much in the way of good reviews, but if basic alien invasion is your cup of tea, you will probably enjoy it too. It is sad to hear the clichÃ¨d excuse for their invasion, but they are very interesting to see. Continue to vote with your dollar and give your hard earned cash to deserving movies. It has a few clichÃ©s but in the end it was a good way to spend a 90 minutes or so. Funny, the top monthly grosses have all happened since 2007, most since 2009, and 4 in 2011 alone."
7615,"Stand out performances by Greg Kinnear and Marisa Tomei as well. they all deliver very memorable performances, and they added a lot to their characters. The plot is right on the money, with with a series of turns and twists that entertain at every junction. the characters were fun and seemed very familiar, easy to identify with. the Characters and acting were the best thing in the movie, a wonderful cast lead by Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Ed Harris, Jennifer Connely and Marisa TOmey."
7616,"A number of scenes are quite good. These are the scenes that create great humanity and drama between the characters, in an non-contrived, believable manner. It's a movie for grown - ups, sharp and funny. The supporting stuff have given some wonderful performances, Edward Burns as the perfect man / potential - husband, and Megan Fox as the perfect girlfriend. One area Friends With Kids absolutely wins at is its ability to have believable, real - life conversations that are projected through a mature, human scope."
7617,"You'll see the common subjects documentaries are made off: the beginnings, the struggle, the breakthrough. Kevin Clash's journey from a quiet kid with an unusual passion, to one of the most legendary and well - respected puppeteers in the world, is downright inspirational. But somehow, even if you're aware you're gonna see something special regarding the life of Mr. Clash, it'll take you by surprise. What lifts this is the joy it brings and shares, not just the Muppets and Jim Henson, but just the wonderful spirit that doing what you really love can bring. It is a cinematic adventure that takes you through Kevin's journey and introduces you to a world of puppeteers who live and breathe to create childhood magic."
7619,"If you love animals and / or Dolphins. The charismatic Harry Connick Jr. gives a stellar performance, providing Sawyer with a role model. Cozi Zuehlsdorf makes her acting debut as Hazel Haskett, Sawyer's best friend. Freeman gives credence to Dr. McCarthy and, thanks to him not being in the right frame of mind, his dedication to creating a new tail for Winter. This movie opens opportunity for discussion with your kids OR you can just go and enjoy the story."
7620,"She doesn't just look like her, but she talks like her, her facial expressions are spot on. All the important aspects of Thatcher's policies and the legacy her government left behind are dealt with in far too shallow a manner, while any insight into Thatcher as a person gets lost amidst an onrush of excessive newsreel footage. Sure, it checks off the list as far as famous moments go, but a more in depth insight into how she ran the country would've been nice. The nearest the film gets to real depth, politically - speaking, is when it devotes fifteen whole minutes of precious screen time to the Falklands War. Streep is mesmerizing as usual, but the mode of storytelling employed by screenwriter Abi Morgan and director Phyllida Lloyd â€“ sporadic flashbacks among elongated stretches of following the elderly and mentally fragile Maggie â€“ is a huge misfire."
7621,"Into their lives pops Emelia, a rebellious, seductive and intelligent teenager whose sole claim to fame is her apparent ancestor Arthur Conan Doyle (she dreams of becoming a writer to carry on her legacy). But Felicity Jones and Jessica Brown Findlay carry the weight of the film and are believable opposites, angel and devil, bookworm and loose cannon. See it for the scenery, the performances and for the drama. Upon return matters change: Granny dies, Emelia grieves, the affair between Emelia and Jonathan becomes open, and everything must change. Without exception the cast is first rate - Ormond and Koch are already established stars and Jessica Brown Findlay and Felicity Jones prove they are on their way to become very important actresses."
7623,"In the '70s, they were natural animals like sharks, killer whales, reptiles, furry animals and insects. Those who loved it saw a competently directed action horror film in a realistic setting filled with real people facing real threats. The guy sitting next to Liam changes seats and the plane is clearly parked at the terminal. If you want to see good acting in a scenic backdrop with lots of scary moments, you will like this movie. This is a really depressing and disturbing film - almost certainly a bust at the box office but "" The Grey "" is really really good - an existentialist parable - in wolves clothing."
7625,"Sharp, uncomplicated, and thrilling ,' Haywire' packs its punches quite effectively. Carano is great in her role, totally believable and the girl does her own stunts! By and large he succeeds and Carano looks like someone, given the right material who could breakout as an action star. But this film kept the action grounded in the physical capabilities of its very capable star, and that made it anything but boring. The character that Gina Carano plays in this movie is very focused and professional (as she should be in this kind of job)."
7627,"However, the brashness and oddness of this film have surely earned it a spot alongside cult classics such as Eraserhead. What this singular piece of nastiness has going for it in the main is brevity, no film of 88 minutes really ever outstays its welcome. If you enjoy watching people forced to consume feces, this film may be right up your alley. His implacability and remorselessness say all that needs to be said about someone who has been kept as an animal and poked one too many times."
7629,"Actions were in place, and were used well to create suspense. A very nice way to spend 105 minutes and well worth your viewing time. Cage makes a credible work in the leading role, and he is well complemented by the solid performances from January Jones and Guy Pearce. His career is always interesting, even if his films aren't - he seems to make, in equal measure (although not necessarily consecutively) critically acclaimed art - house movies, multiplex crowd pleasers, and utter clunkers. Even if you don't care for it, you still can easily admit that it's better than any of Cage's other recent films."
7630,"Hostel III is a bit more polished and stylish than the first two. It's a lot of fun and a pleasant change of pace from the downbeat final acts of the first two Hostels. Hostel: Part III is radically different from the first two though. The storyline is engaging, there's twists and turns you wont see coming and there's a gory kill (the first one). Hostel: Part III could be so named for the three main points that set it apart from its predecessors."
7633,"a delightful celebration of everything in life that makes it worthwhile. Francois Cluzet was also just as brilliant, as he usually is. Just seen last night, amazing movie, great performances from actors, particularly from Omar, and Cluzet is great as usual. The reason of this choice is smoothly handled by the script: the film starts with all the job applicants, every one of them unnaturally posing and getting mixed in prepared answers. RIch of emotions on a simple story where ordinary people become extraordinary."
7635,"What a waste - because when the horror does finally come, those scenes are actually pretty good. Those movies took their sweet time building the most delicious atmosphere and tension. But for a certain niche in horrorville, where the adults reside who love a sombre tone, character and story build up and a last quarter pay off, then The Innkeepers is a little gem of a creeper. This automatically alienates a good portion of the horror faithful, especially in the younger echelons, for those who need and seek thrill after thrill, a ghost train ride of a horror movie, The Innkeepers is sure to be a hard slog to get through. A ghost story about an old hotel with a few secrets and a small yet interesting cast of specters and human characters, namely the female lead (Actress Sara Paxton) who while working the last weekend before the hotel is closed for good decides along with the other employee (Actor Pat Healy) to have a few scares ghost hunting the place."
7638,"Perhaps, that was what Weisen wanted to achieve all along. His character has a lot of choices to make, many of which go against all common sense. * Also try - Happythankyoumoreplease & It's Kind Of A Funny Story While this is a very good movie that forces you to keep watching it does tend to drag in a few places, but not enough to be boring. If you do enjoy this movie, don't forget to take a look at :' 500 days of Summer' and' It's kind of a funny story', which both are pretty close in terms of atmosphere to this one."
7651,"The Ghost Rider himself is a fearsome spectacle, and his every appearance brings with it the gleeful anticipation that one of the movie's numerous baddies is going to get his much - deserved punishment in an especially painful â€” and spectacular â€” fashion. Neveldine and Taylor's film brings about the return of the Ghost Rider. But if you're really stoned or just want to see cool sh*t on screen for an hour and a half and there's literally nothing else to watch, go ahead and knock yourself out with Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance. Ghost Rider looks badass, the visuals in the big set pieces are nice to look at, and if you have no interest in the story you can definitely shut your brain off and enjoy the insanity happening on screen. Cage, who is a fan of comics in real life, is well - cast as Blaze, and captures the character's conflicting emotions with expert ease."
7644,"Probably the weakest part is the environment chunk, but even that has some good bits. This is a hilarious stand - up act from Louise CK, and a very well - directed and presented one at that. Louis CK is always a joy to watch, and this only strengthens his collection and furthers the thought that he's the best comedian right now. It is good to see people do positive things to challenge piracy, rather than threatening the parents of a 13 year old girl with jail because she downloaded a Justin Bieber song on their internet connection."
7648,"An antidote to bombastic, finger - wagging fare such as Day After Tomorrow, it earns your tears at several moments. Instead, theirs is the account of an ordinary and vulnerable man and woman with extraordinary resilience, who attack, then embrace each other, stumbling over their circumstances as they learn to transcend them. Then, all that matters is how these two characters cope with an epidemic that bursts, depriving people their senses. McKenzie films Glasgow in glory and decay, making wonderful use of water and reflected light as he did in Young Adam. The conclusion will be to start taste the joy, hear the colors and see the sun."
7649,"It is full of effecting moments and feelings. This film has decent music choices all in all. Kokowaah follows in the fame of the previous Til Schwiger's films and as well as it's predecessors, it also keeps the bar pretty high. Aside from that, Katharina Thalbach was lots of fun at the dentist's. An important piece of work by Til Schweiger and his crew and a must see for German speaking people!"
7655,"The acting was wonderful, not only from the familiar faces but also from the newcomers to the big screen. All of the actors (except for a couple of the smaller characters) gave exceptional performances. A coming of age road trip filled with laughter, soul searching and twists that will leave you cheering for all the best things in others and, in the end, you may even find out a little something about yourself. The film is classy in a sense that it does not condemn or vilify the characters it contrast. The entire cast acted as if that was ACTUALLY their story they were telling and it really made the performances shine through."
7657,"It is entertaining, exciting, draws you in an keeps you, stirs your emotions, and leaves a positive message. As part of this the story was made more believable by some revelations mid-way through the movie about some of the characters that showed their less than perfect lives and values. The acting is generally good and the characters believable, with some only slightly over the top humor at times. The humor actually is used nicely to lighten things up a bit as some of the characters are forced to deal with a tragedy in their family. A must for all fathers and would be fathers."
7660,"The settings are incredible - taking viewers from Attu Island in the Aleutians to Brownsville, Texas, and everywhere in between. That was probably the funniest moment in the entire film. What followed were many years of exercise, pleasure and reward for one of life's most interesting avocations. Thankfully though, there is enough scientific meat, nice scenery and decent performances from the others to pull it off. If you liked him in those movies, you will like him in The Big Year as well."
7662,"But that is because it is real and because everything you see in here is what happened. One bright spot is a brand new, state of the art high school; the new home of the Manassas Tigers. Yet there is a divine humanity in this story that isn't ignored, and the result, in the long run, was a long - overdue one Manassas will cherish for another 110 years. The film chronicles the 2009 season, showing modest beginnings, but a wonderfully unbelievable conclusion with opportunities soaring for the team, players, and school. It's a film that shows the real struggles of real people that you care about."
7665,"It has moments which will make you laugh, but its true strength is in those moments which will make you smile. David is presented, through the plaintiffs' attorney, a package of profiles of the 145 children. Of course, there are scenes which may look cheesy for some, but viewed with the proper attitude without cynicism, these scenes are actually quite nice and even touching. His delivery and mannerisms fit the somewhat sardonic material immensely well and simply put he's just damn charming. Then, because the court has all the plaintiffs listed in detail, he is able to find the people, one by one."
7666,"If possible, go for one of the pre-screenings or see it later in a cinema near you. It is far more than filling emotional voids, it is your health and your medicine. Consult with multiple doctors and nutritionists. Eating a diet of whole food, low fat, plant based foods, will keep you healthy. Physicians should watch this movie, so do their patients and relatives."
7667,"There is nothing subtle that occurs at all, everything is incredibly blatant and wildly over-the-top (and frequently incredibly gritty and disgusting). This shows a focus which is integral to the film's unique quality and it often takes many unexpected turns as far as typical narratives go. Sean William Scott deserves special mention, he sheds all his typecast personas and have acted the character of Doug Glatt with all his heart. He adapted and co-wrote the script with Seth Rogen's usual writing partner Evan Goldberg, and spices up almost every line with a unique expletive. Got some Good Acting, GREAT Fight Scenes and some Laughs too."
7670,"Overall, if you liked "" Everything Must Go "" then this movie is for you. But there are plenty of laughs throughout the film which make it very enjoyable. And the cast and chemistry is well shown as "" Jeff Who Lives at Home "" features veteran Susan Sarandon and up and coming stars Ed Helms and Jason Segel and the work of all blend well into a good picture. The film works mostly due to Jason Segel, who's affecting as the eternally optimistic Jeff. You'll never double over in laughter, but the whole thing feels pleasant, and at eighty minutes, goes down pretty smooth."
7673,"Corman really made his mark in the 60's. And Roger Corman is everywhere - and by everyone regarded as the king of B - movies. Considering how many films Corman has been involved with over the decades it's really amazing how much they got into this 90 - minute movie. You have to see this if you love film, and you'll certainly have plenty to stick on your watchlist. Besides, the thing about B - movies is that it keeps reminding you about it how complex and painstaking the movie making process actually is."
7674,"And there's a surprise installed that provided something of a sucker punch, that affirms Sukiyabashi Jiro, is under fine hands indeed. It is certainly one of the best documentaries of 2012. Many shots are based on the golden mean, and placed exactly two - thirds to the right of frame - and there is throughout a sense of real thought and balance. Jiro is acknowledged as the world's best - his restaurant in a pass in an underground station in Tokyo sits 9 people at a time, has to be booked at least a month in advance, and costs the best part of a week's wages. Jiro's restaurant Sukiyabashi Jiro in a Tokyo office building basement has reservations available a month away."
7678,"This movie was incredible with it's knife fights and how effective and swift they are in close quarters. What makes this film a standout is the unflinching action and well choreographed fight sequences by leads Yayan Ruhian and Iko Uwais. The characters are sufficiently developed with a couple of twists in the story to keep it interesting. The Raid gives fair proportion to fighters in this movie. There is an intensity to this film that resembles scenes from "" Black Hawk Down "", with very intelligent setups for conflict, and innovative approaches to getting from point A to point B."
7680,"Throughout the story, you begin to make connections to the world around you. There are some really funny scenes sprinkled throughout, and just as many deeply thought - provoking moments. He is a bit player in dozens of TV shows and movies, and it is nice to see him finally get a leading role. This film does tackle a lot of social problems that exist in society today. In between the action and the comedy, Joel Murray's character delivers scathing indictments of society that had the Toronto audience break out into spontaneous applause."
7686,"As for the likes of Steve, wow! The first documentary Louis Theroux made about the infamous Phelps family was terrifically well made and is the best film about these nasty cult members. The Phelps family seem like the perfect subject for Louis Theroux since his mode of operation generally is to go into odd or extreme groups (families, hobbies, jobs etc) and chat with the people in an innocent - abroad type way. The only good bit is also a repeat of last time, where Louis chats with the 18 - year old Grace, which is a repeat of when he did get good material from a couple of the teenage girls."
7687,"When you add the likes of Dames Maggie Smith and Judy Dench to the mix, the delicious Celia Imrie, Tom Wilkinson and Ronald Pickup (with an honourable mention to the latter, who brought a wonderfully rakish comedic performance to the mix) - and you can't go wrong. But fortunately The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a charmer and even the youngest viewers will find something to enjoy here. The colours, the faces, the smiles, the sounds, the hustle and bustle of the packed streets all assault the senses, not just for the characters but also for the viewer. It was like a great and funny and cleansing session at a cinema / therapist, that just washed over you, so touching were all the emotions and insights, so real to life, you could not believe they were acting. There is racism, snobbery, love, joy and sadness in just the right amounts throughout the story."
7694,"Some moments of this film are exciting and others are moving. This is compelling in and of itself, but as part of "" 96 Minutes, "" it's just filler material. The performance by Evan Ross won him an a much deserved award at SXSW, and Jonathan Michael Trautmann also did a wonderful job. The actors, though largely unknown, give capable performances. The last half hour of the film is the best, when the film no longer has flashbacks and flash - forwards."
7698,"According to interviews, director Zal Batmanglij is working on a trilogy that will continue the story--very exciting news. OK, considering this will be a series of movies, think like a movie writers and what will keep people interested and the movie makes perfect sense. Overall, the actors in the film do a great job (especially Marling) and it proves to be a promising directorial debut for Zal Batmanglij. Nice music from Rostam Batmanglij with a good - looking production value thanks to cinematographer Rachel Morrison and production designer Scott Enge. As with "" The East "", the other co-writer and director is her friend Zal Batmanglij and, as with "" Another Earth "" and "" THe East ""."
7701,"Yeah, see this for some good laughs. Shirley MacLain was brilliant in developing a complex character in what was almost a non-speaking role. As Marjorie lavishes Bernie with expensive gifts and luxurious vacations, she grows increasingly manipulative in her need to control his every move to meet her every need. Great moments of physical comedy and also some twisted, dark moments of catching a glimpse into Bernie's spiraling psyche. The movie is a fascinating meld of the Coen Brothers' "" Fargo "" and Hal Ashby's "" Harold and Maude "" with an unexpected dose of Christopher Guest's mockumentaries."
7702,"The kind that make it seem like everything is innocent. Oh, and the use of Leonard Cohen's "" Take this Waltz "" song fit right in over the credits. That Polley can coax such fine dramatic work from Rogen and Silverman is a credit to her growing confidence as a filmmaker. Rogan does a nice job handling the acting up to that scene, but the limits of his skill show through in the montage. Their marriage is comfortable, and their interactions reflect a lived - in familiarity marked by cute practical jokes and quirky riffs of humor."
7711,"The chemistry of their different relationships with each other was fresh and flawless, especially as they evolved. Blunt, DeWitt, and Duplass have an immediate, winning chemistry with each other and they'd better. Usually, with aspects like these, combined with beautiful scenery, a movie isn't tough to get through. The comedic moments were well delivered, and the pulling - at - the - heartstrings moments, very real. Blunt is pretty, Duplass has some amusing moments, and DeWitt has a very watchable awkwardly nihilistic manner about her."
7740,"It's a quite amazing performance, and her scenes with an almost equally impressive McConaughey provide the film's highlights. If the film has a definite strong point, it is in the performances. Friedkin has garnered terrific performances from a top line cast. But the award - winning performance here goes to McConaughey, who is three for three this year, with roles in Bernie (another film looking to brew the idea of "" Texas noir "") and Magic Mike buoying him to an actor of near first - rate level. Famed director William Friedkin (The Exorcist) returns to fine form."
7748,"The city is lovingly brought to life through its buildings, most of them ordinary big city buildings much like the two characters are ordinary inhabitants. A wonderful story by Argentine director Gustavo Taretto, who expanded his 2005 original short film of the same title. The talented Mr. Taretto shows a keen insight in the souls of Martin and Mariana. The central cast featuring Pilar Lopez de Ayala and Javier Drolas is also attractive. Sidewalls (2011) A wonderful, heartwarming, smart and funny film."
7763,"This is one of those little gems that is precious and hard to find. The performances are all excellent and it's directed and shot with a light touch. The situations are realistic and relatable, and the characters are true. just the dialog and in one scene with Alan Tudyk, the hilarious look on his face told volumes. , after seeing the adorable tykes in very natural settings."
7764,"Berlinger and Sinosky persevered, as did others who feel that the verdict was unjust. A commendable, poignant and to a certain extent liberating non-fictional feature about solidarity, survival and human greatness which shows how much people are willing to do and how far they are willing to go for the sake of someone else. This marks the possible end to what could very well be some of the greatest, deepest, most personal and up close documentaries ever captured on film. John Mark Byers, stepfather of Christopher Byers, makes peace with Echols and is now convinced of their innocence. This scrutinizing documentary which is as judicial as it is humane, leads this shocking, provocative and heartrending true story which gained worldwide recognition in the late 1990s closer to the truth, and confirms the invaluable importance of critical journalism and documentary filmmaking."
7768,"To put it simply, this is one of the best, most intellectually stimulating films of the last ten years. The film chronicles the living conditions, the activities, and the day - to - day routines of many different people across twenty - five different countries. The score was so perfectly matched to the scenery that, in some places, it was impossible to believe that the music was not present when the scenes were filmed. It's a journey around the world, showing the immense beauty and the grotesque horrors of humanity, interspersed with stunning natural landscapes and the fallout of natural disaster. It sounds preposterous, but it's true: In 99 minutes, Samsara achieves something approaching a comprehensive portrait of the totality of human experience."
7771,"The writers of this movie and whoever has given it good reviews must've been on some kinda substance. One of the biggest problems is how quick it wants to start. By combining footage of many cameras and points of view this movie is just the right combination of "" first person witnessing "" and actual traditional cinematography. There's definitely nothing new or original to the story but the scares are effective and well done. After some easy scares and cool effects, the movie take his path to a dramatic ending."
7798,"This is no masterpiece, but it's not quite as bad as some of the reviews make it out to be. A lot of pulpy outings like this get accused of aping Quentin Tarantino's style, and while that is often a lazy, bullshit critic's clichÃ©, here the claim is understandable and not necessarily a bad thing. He tasks them with intercepting a mysterious package that passes through a lonesome truckstop diner."
8090,"Any scene, however played, seemed perfectly fitting for these two characters. Those comic scenes gave the film just the right touch to not be mainstream. The music in the movie fits its scenes perfectly. It's always nice seeing Andy Serkis in his actual skin and Thomas Sangster's performance is nothing short of impressive. He's got an interesting face and was also memorable in' Game of Thrones'."
7819,"This film is better than most reviewers give it credit for. And Mira Sorvino is one of the most underrated actresses out there. The primary redeeming factor of this film is the length: mercifully a short 80 minutes. Mira Sorvino and Tammy Blanchard do excel in this unusual character study of two sisters. Union Square, a snapshot of the dysfunctional relationship between two New York City sisters, starring Mira Sorvino and Tammy Blanchard, provides several comedic moments but not enough to warrant a recommendation."
7827,"The acting is great and you'll enjoy a lot of laughs and maybe even a few tears. The film really worked thanks to some great performances from the cast and an emotionally gripping script. Apparently Jake and Mary were pretty much a perfect couple during their teenage years. The chemistry he shares here with Kate Mara is amazing, and the song he performs at the karaoke bar was one of the highlights of the movie. Its a simple story about a high school reunion but it really nails it."
7870,"All of the technical elements (cinematography, lighting, sound, etc) were great, including the subtle effects work. That being said, all is done tastefully and artistically, and viewers will be glad that they saw this little gem of a film. It was well worth seeing more than once because you understand more of the subtle messages the more times you watch it. Charlie David, Sean Lockhart, Timo Descamps, Julia Morizawa, and the rest of the cast truly give stellar performances, beyond what is often expected in independent films. While certainly not a perfect film, it has great heart and production values (great CGI and location work in Seattle) outweigh a few short comings."
7875,"So, this is certainly a must SEE film, but thank goodness for subtitles. You don't just have prostitutes and johns milling around, you have small children and animals running around as well. The more potent the message, the more it will take into account counterpoints and other perspectives anyway. What makes the film unique is that there is no narration or cuts to "" experts "" and hardly any interviews. It shows you women who are wives and mothers, girls who are selling themselves to be able to afford to take classes in another vocation."
7878,"He became hooked on various substances and fame. Easily the redeeming factor of this film are the juxtapositions of Williams in his heyday and Williams today. Much credit to him for including some of the scenes that are things a lot of people would have taken out. Like after knowing each other for over 2 years Paul just happens to mention, "" Oh. Now twenty years sober, he still performs - just in much smaller venues."
7884,"David Redmon and Ashley Sabin's Girl Model is a lot like Lee Hirsch's directorial debut in the documentary world, Bully, which came out earlier this year. In seventy eight minutes, Girl Model is a fine documentary, but it lacks examination on the larger scale issue at hand here and takes the passive, almost constructive criticism tactic on the modelling industry. The way it depicts the fragility and the weakness at the core of this thirteen years old girl, and her friend, feels real. Just saw this at MIFF today and found it very absorbing. Later on she gets fibroids and cysts and act's like she's pregnant."
7925,"Indeed it's very obvious that the creative forces in the band are Bono and The Edge, with the other two apparently having an easy ride of it, in fact the ghost of Andrew Ridgeley came to mind. Next, Bono's free composition is funny, from babble to word to lyrics. For those who have listened to "" Axtung Baby "", they are already accustomed by those experimentations but here, the visual adds emotion. Technically, the documentary reveals two gems: how a song ("" one "" in this case) found its melody in another one. After their Lovetown Tour was over in 1989, Bono and Edge were dissatisfied with their sound."
7935,"Seemingly a perfect way to start, a back - story is implied begging to be told, and future events destined to unfold to eventually come together in an interesting climax and dÃ©nouement. Intelligent, demure and sinister, there is a potent dread and sorrow that pervades the scenes she is in, and permeates throughout the rest of the film in ripples that seem to emanate from her presence. Pawel Pawlikowski is a director who has a story to tell, and does so with flair and imagination, without ever alienating his audience. To an extent, he's probably right; it takes a special kind of person to not only conceive of fictitious people, places, and plots but to also obsess over them until the story has naturally resolved itself. The dank atmospheric cinematography is by Ryszard Lenczewski and the correctly strange musical score (from an aria form a Handel opera sung by a countertenor to piano music excerpts form the Romantic era) is the work of Max de Wardener."
7960,"Watching it with other FMA fans at Otakon (other otakus) was quite the movie watching experience as people all cheered, clapped, and laughed at the appropriate times. It wasn't the animation; though "" - Milos "" utilizes a completely different kind of design and animation than either of the two anime series, once you've accepted that contrast it's easy to marvel at how good - looking it is (almost like a cousin of Ghibli animation). For those wanting to feast their eyes on flashy Japanese animation, or simply to escape from the dullness of everyday life, this motion picture will be a good time. Compared to Shamballa which concluded the original FMA a better movie. And important thing is that these kind of experiments looks right with animation movies only."
8013,"It has some nice surprises along the way, and is involving from start till finish. Sharni Vinson is a good solid lead. You're Next doesn't reinvent anything, but it consistently and confidently keeps the formula well oiled and proves to be one of the better films of its type. Good horror movies are few and far between these days. A lot of yelling and screaming can hide a lot of sins."
8015,"Their dads loved them and tried to make them excel. At the same time, it is a story about a very real family with very real problems and tells each of its members individual stories. However, the Cowsill brothers had some serious talent especially the eldest, Billy, and they had their unbelievably driven father, Bud, an ex-Navy lifer who truly believed in his children's talent and was determined to bust down doors to see them succeed. They were the inspiration for the show The Partidge Family. With the final inclusion of a fifth brother, The Cowsills managed to score four Top 40 hits including three in the Top 10."
8054,""" Ausente "" is just a beautiful film. Anyone who loved Plan B probably will love Ausente too. Two lead actors, Carlos EchevarrÃ­a and Javier De Pietro pretty well fit it. Another beauty of the film is that there is no heightened drama or dialogues or anything. The slow build of the characters is fabulous with the relationships unfolding, refolding and unfolding back again."
7691,"Different point of view, different stories, different but natural talented faces. The writing and directing are excellent and the cast includes such talented thesps as Domhnall Gleeson, Rory Kinnear, Toby Kebbell, Hayley Atwell, Jon Hamm, Jason Flemyng and Rupert Everett - to name but a few. It questions your life, routines, choices you made, the basic code of ethics you have. As many others have pointed out, the series is superbly put together: the actors are great; the script, if anything, is minimalist and the production excellent. Well thought out plots, characters, settings and really good storytelling."
8559,"Because it is different and defined more by nuances. And, sure, because to see it is the basic way for discover the profound moving confession about yourself and the others and the borders betweem that. Too much "" deus ex machina "", i. e. incredible coincidences that are used to support and promote the action; also the clichÃ© elements are particularly used in this way, what the authenticity of the whole movie suffers from. He is everything that Lukas wants to be--perfect body and the confidence to go with it. But one of the hardest lessons Lukas must learn is how can he expect someone to love and see the real him if he can't even tolerate his own self?"
7743,"Geeks, smart people, romantics, sci - fi lovers. Backed by a strong cast including Paul Dano, Steve Coogan, Antonio Banderas, Annette Bening, and Elliott Gould, Ruby Sparks attempts to be that latest independent film to bring audiences something new and creative. As a whole, it still manages to work on most levels and accomplishes what it seems to set out to do. This is easily one of the more unique romantic comedies to come along in a while stepping away from the normal format and instead taking a left hand turn creating something new. Ruby herself is played by ZoÃ« Kazan, granddaughter of the great Elia (On the Waterfront et al), with great energy and some charm."
7818,"Director, Richard Bates Jr. makes an explosive dÃ©but as newcomer of this genre and has a bold eye that's unflinching. McCord carries the film home, aided by strong co-acting by Lords. One of the more memorable horror offerings of 2012. Luminous and vibrant, these scenes impact and leave a stain that won't come out in a cold wash. But it is a solid movie with good acting, great visual dream segments and a decent plot."
7738,"Nevertheless, Julie Delpy was way out there and it was fun to see. Julie Delpy writes very well and maintains a good pace as director. trilogy and was thrilled to see she's written, directed and acted in these two "" 2 Days . "" They're a classic middle - class couple, living in a nice New York apartment and both with good jobs. The dialogue Julie crafts sounds authentic and makes the characters credible."
7820,"Following the visceral and subversive CachÃ© and the more refined and sprawling White Ribbon, it appeared that Haneke had reached a creative zenith. If anything, Emmanuelle Riva gives one of the very best performances of the year (perhaps the best). One of the greatest and profound achievements seen on screen in many years, this is film at it's purest and most powerful form. It is part of the searing authenticity of the film, and that makes the more tender moments even more special. Haneke's steady and visionary directorial hand promises many moving and heartbreaking sequences, while still providing a poetic exemplification of a well - lived life's concluding moments."
7821,"One of its many creative touches is how you must learn the control, and there are no menus or directions on how to do certain things. Deep understanding of others creative work often springs into criticism - but thats only positive since it means that the other one has understood the creation and is able to add something new into it - thus being part of the logics of progress. As a book for the writer, as a painting for the painter, this film proves â€“ a game is someone's whole life. The pacing and storytelling invokes a wide range of emotions. Its stern poignancy provides eye - opening levels of insight to people possibly wanting to get into the field and those wanting to go into the bigger field."
7822,"And lastly, the music fits everything perfectly. A vast gang of street thugs led by their grotesque but incredibly strong and savage leader. Turns out that it was an excellent decision which not only successfully adapted the first half of Frank Miller's epic, but added layers to the story and characters that the limited page count of the graphic novel could not leave in. It has been years since Batman went into retirement. This is a very violent, post-modern Gotham, not too unlike Christopher Nolan's' The Dark Knight Trilogy', and younger children are better directed towards either Adam West or, if animated, then' Batman: The Animated Series' and its successors."
7823,"He is cool, calculated, unemotional player, consciously going for high stakes. The bank that he directs, and pretty much all the interiors he ever dwells in do not fall far behind many European royal palaces. Marc Tourneuil (Gad Elmaleh) is an ambitious executive of the French Phenix Bank. In the seventies, working with screenwriters Jorge SemprÃºn and Franco Solinas, he made several good movies: The Confession, State of Siege, Special Section. It's regrettable because Costa - Gavras had the material for a good film, not the most subtle one, but for a gripping thriller and fair entertainment."
7824,"Daniel Day Lewis was dazzling - his eyes just penetrated you, as usual. He is an underrated talent most likely due to his lack of a prolific career, somewhat like director Terrence Malick. With this film, there is a lot going on in terms of subtleties and there is a plethora of weight that rests on the film's script that at times makes this a challenging picture to watch. Here, Day - Lewis teams up with one of Hollywood's most prolific men, Steven Spielberg, who is coming off a stellar 2011, where he produced both Super 8 and Transformers: Dark of the Moon and directed both The Adventures of Tintin and War Horse, two acclaimed pictures. 90 minutes of this 150 minute film was spent on the 13th Amendment."
7989,"And there were some great talents on the cast list and some familiar faces here and there, which was quite nice. They're completely unsafe and insane, played by Brian Petsos and Oscar Isaak. Harry (Brian Petsos) is a good guy who has done bad things and is in over his head. The movie managed to get quite a good cast together (which partly owed to the fact, that most actors are in it for a few minutes). What is always great, is small supporting Rolex by know actors, and there's a bunch of them here, like Elijah Wood, Kirsten Wiig, David Rasche, Ryan Phillippe, Adam Brody, Garret Dillahunt, Kevin Corrigan, Stephen Payne, Gillian Jacobs, Amy Seimetz, Helen Rogers, Bobby Moynihan, John Di Benedetto, Brian Donahue and so on."
7825,"But it is entertaining and Patton Oswalt holds it together very nicely. It actually has a some very good messages about respecting nature and remembering to sometimes forget about modern technologies and to go have fun outside. The movie has a great premise and some big big laughs. Oswalt plays Randy and Knoxville plays Kirk. Randy, inspired by his elderly ill father, rounds up all the kids from his brother's house and takes them on a real wilderness camping trip (without anyone's permission)."
7826,"It's kind of got a feel good vibe but also a lot of demented moments. The cast is great, but the performances average. Richard Lewis, does an amazing job, his best role in years. The footages from the past are outstanding and the conclusion alternates between a corny and a beautiful ending. Amy Heckerling tells a nice story, with sharp direction, candy colored set design, and some enviable fashions."
7736,"If you treat it like a joke, you will have a lot of laughs. Under the eye of director Akiva Schaffer ("" Hot Rod "") and penmanship of writers Jared Stern, Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen, however, the film is badly - managed and all over the map â€” thematically speaking. All of the actors play quite well off each other and manage to give their characters some distinctive and enjoyable personalities. This is a great film to see, escape the chaotic world and have a few laughs. "" The Watch "" is a funny buddy comedy, filled with crude jokes and the silly shenanigans that you'd expect from Stiller, Vaughn, the rest of the cast, and writer Seth Rogen."
7828,"In this film DreamWorks did it all exactly right. Rise of the Guardians can be considered one of the great films of the year. The set pieces are brilliant and epic, yet subtle. The animation was amazing, the characters were well - modelled and the colours and landscapes were really beautifully realised. Alexandre Desplat's music score has the right amount of sparkling adventure and whimsical fantasy."
7830,"Sissy Spacek and Kris Krsitoppher are good. Their performances were all worthy of this well written and directed feature. Charlie Hunnam is fun to watch, he is smart and never looks bad in what he does. The original musical score by Marco Beltrami underlines all the facets of this tale. Eric Bana is engaging in an aloof amalgamation of insanity and infantile."
7831,"It was a much, much higher quality than you would expect for a bunch of web videos. Superb acting, gorgeous visuals, a beautiful soundtrack, and the promise to deliver more and more in future episodes. This series manages to fulfill Halo fans expectations of a glimpse into the universe they love, as well as provide new fans with relatable, intensely realistic characters that allow new viewers to experience this universe for themselves, along with the characters. Obviously, most viewers will be halo fans, but if you need an intro to the halo universe, this web series is an excellent start. That is unless you're looking for non-stop action, explosions and witty one liners said by Master Chief."
7835,"The character designs and movement are excellent and the pacing and story structure are executed effectively. It looks absolutely beautiful, the story is sweet, charming and fascinating and everything comes together marvelously at the end. This is one of the best pieces of animation to come out of the Walt Disney Company in years! Paper airplanes flying from the window to the window are very beautiful. But it also had a nice distinctive style--mostly in black and white and with an interesting retro 1950s style."
7836,"On positive side: sharp, well - lit photography and settings. The Hitchcock humor is allowed to shine through and his battles with Paramount Studio head Barney Balaban (Richard Portnow) and the censorship board (Kurtwood Smith) are excellent. Slavish in its adoration of a director who, on a good day, could be amongst the best in the business and on a bad one, just about the worst ("" Torn Curtain "", anyone? ) She helps guide Hitchcock through his film journey's doing re-writes on scripts and providing directorial and production support. Director Sasha Gervasi works off a screenplay by John J, McLaugnlin based on the book "" Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho "" by Stephen Rebello and a good portion of the film is fascinating stuff."
7837,"Most of the movie is shot in black and white and the cinematography, done by Simone Zampagni, is beautiful. Probably the most impressive element of "" Cesare deve morire "" is the performances of the inmate actors. The outstanding performance of Salvatore Striano (Brutus) was striking and rewarded by the audience. The performances are so convincing that one has to contemplate on the nature of human destiny. The interesting thing is that on all of the levels the movie feels scripted."
7708,"Regardless, this third installment is a marked improvement from its two excellent predecessors, offers a great deal of fun, and promises a hear - pumping ride. The film itself is like a spectacular show with so many wonderful colors. It is so refreshing to see a movie in 3D that actually takes full advantage of its capability. While everything is fun, the wonderful visuals adds the film's enjoyment. Some scenes are ridiculously exciting, some are awfully eye - candy."
7707,"Mark Duplass and Jake Johnson are excellent, and that new kid Karan Soni. The film weaves the boy - meets - girl main storyline with two sub-plots of self - discovery: the thirty - something writer's encounter with his old high school fling, and the classic - nerd intern encouraged to make his own youthful fling. Audrey Plaza's star turn took the dopey outsider and added her own understated charm that illuminated every frame, especially the campfire scene with Mark Duplass. Jake M. Johnson (New Girl) and Karan Soni add several laughs to the bizarre Actors Duplass and Plaza are so great radiating weirdness off of each other."
7842,"The rest of the cast are all fine but to be honest the effects are the main stars here and technically it is very impressive even if it is a bit overdone at times. They must work with what they have, and what they have is quite enough for one pleasing and inventive two - hour movie - or a nine - hour disaster stretched over three years. Freeman is a good Bilbo and his mannerisms work well (which helps negate his limited range) while of course McKellen is always welcome. The detail in Gollum's expressions, beautifully captured again by Andy Serkis, is even more incredible than before. It was, however, an epic adventure seen through the eyes of a single character, a character who had a realistic perspective of his small contribution to the world around him."
7844,"His portrayal is one of the great performances of a historical figure in recent years. From this point on, all of the relationships become more real and approachable. It seems to be a profound moment in which they become comfortable with one another, themselves, and the unity between their countries. There are plenty of decent moments in Hyde Park on Hudson including Murray as FDR and some wonderful shots of beautiful country landscapes. The funny thing is this - people went to great lengths to pretend nothing was wrong with Roosevelt's legs whatsoever."
7706,"But the last 8 minutes or so are just really well done. Also the cinematography is excellent with some remarkable scenes. Overall, A Thousand Words is a decent comedy, not the best or the crudest mind you, but still decent. With a limited number of words at his disposable, the writers did a nice job picking the right words at the right moment. The film does carry nice message, and tugs the heartstrings for those who make the time investment on this one."
7846,"It's ten years later, and Fox returns with the even more simply titled "" Yossi, "" which continues the story of the aforementioned character. Even in terms of story and direction, it is a very accomplished work. It packed a lot of emotion and feeling in a scant 65 minutes. The new guy Tom, does good job and looks cute but he does not have that mischief and innocent pure face and eyes of Jagger. From the production values perspective, this film is Eytan Fox's best work to date."
7847,"It's a very captivating film (even with its 160 minutes runtime), and the big raid at the end is quite intense and realistic. the editing, characters, and pacing were very sharp and deliberate and they were supposed to be like that for the purposes of the movie and the content. Regarding the death of UBL - well the movie even leaves that open ended which is pretty consistent with the actual reported events. Its strongest feature is its dramatization of the Navy Seal Team 6 operation in Abbottabad, Pakistan, that killed bin Laden. every single scene looked to create tension, drama, and purpose towards the goal of catching osama."
7848,"There is a lot blood in this movie, romantic scenes without the sex, and the skilled City detectives and Federal agents are portrayed as totally inept goof - ups. Apart from an obviously decent budget, high production values - there is nothing here worthy of a box of popcorn. Now Duhamel has been in some Transformers movies and some other stuff. When the script calls for him to tell his U. S. marshal girlfriend one quick sentence about firefighting, you know perfectly well that he'll say that line again, during a fire, before the end of the movie. In a moment of tenderness, Talia asks Coleman how he gets people out of fires and he delivers his next line ins such a way it might just as well have a great big flashing neon sign that states' REMEMBER THIS LINE."
7754,"It's a great effect to the scenes and you'll love it. ParaNorman is simply great and it's easy enough to recommend. There's some fun play with perspective, and being able to see the dimension that exists in these sets adds a lot to the experience. ParaNorman is a film with many strengths. Overall, the voice acting is great, the animation is superb as always, and the 3D remarkably works well."
7850,"They contribute to a feeling that there is something deeper being said, and by the end one walks out with a feeling that Dupieux subtly and ever so brilliantly schooled the audience. "" Wrong "" is the new absurdist comedy by Quentin Dupieux a. k. a. From William Fichtner's restrained but subtly outrageous performance as this world's version of a zen master to a strange sequence that refuses to define itself as reality or dream, there is enough outlandish content to fill any surrealists imagination. All its surreal imagery has purpose at the end, and the film is at its strongest at the last moments where one can step back and appreciate it as a whole. Jack Plotnick is well - suited for the role of a neurotic guy always on the edge of losing his mind."
7853,The second half really picks up and everything comes to frankly a touching and satisfying conclusion with great performances. Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen are a great comedy team. Be sure to stay for the credits to see just how well they played off each other. The two best parts of this movie were its brevity (90 minutes or so long) and some of the outtakes at the end were worth a chuckle. It was delightful to see Streisand and Rogen working off each other like they have known each other for years.
7854,"Mr. Duvall always delivers a convincing performance, same here. The excitement here doesn't come from over the top stunts or huge explosions. Jack Reacher is one of his best. Jack Reacher was a surprisingly fantastic film. 2012's Jack Reacher has these qualities in spades."
7703,"The juxtaposition of different cultures and personalities was written brilliantly. Nicely paced, crisp dialogue, believable circumstances and plausible events with sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Not that a movie like this requires great acting skills, but the roles played by Rudd, Aniston and Watkins are at least believable. George and Linda (Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston) buy an apartment in New York and immediately find themselves out of work. After a brief sojourn with George's brother Rich who offers George a job, they end up at a commune where the free - spirited life begins to have differing effects on the two of them."
7855,"The performances in this film are brilliant. This was absolutely one of the best movies of the year. They are increasingly effective, especially during horrific flashback scenes. Both Foxx and DiCaprio's performance are both equally amazing. Leonardo Dicaprio is in his best yet."
7725,"Anything good is in the trailer. Matthew McConaughey is a hoot, Great chest and he seems to be relishing the spotlight. Amid the bountiful buttcheeks and brawny pecs on display, there is a real story here about ambition, and goals, and loyalty, and commitment, and self - actualization. Still, it's a film BOTH genders can enjoy, and it shouldn't be limited to "" a movie for the ladies . "" The character that was somewhat interesting was Dallas and he stripped the least (sorry ladies)."
7700,"Even one of the best scenes in the whole movie (Rapace's DIY Cesarean) is just glossed over like it didn't happen when. It has a couple of "" for effect "" gore scenes - but Scott manages to include ZERO tension along with them. A gaggle of fractious goons whose collective scientific nous is rivalled only by that of the Three Stooges. This is pretty obvious in interviews - where Lindelof always manages to publicly kiss Scott's behind. After the procedure, she's simply "" stitched together "" by metal clips in like 3 seconds - and with a bit of local anesthetic, she continues to move and jump about with some moaning."
7724,"Audiences will write you off if you deliver them something inconsistent and scatter - brained that goes beyond 30 inconsequential minutes of their lives, and MacFarlane and co-writers Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild make the majority of adjustments needed to honor that notion. That ability alone assures "" Ted "" will be seen as better than a majority of foul - mouthed, dirty - minded comedies. Despite a serious relationship of four years with Lori (Mila Kunis), nearly middle - aged John is still ripping bongs and watching '80s "" Flash Gordon "" with his equally irresponsible teddy bear best friend. Wahlberg and Kunis are generally pretty convincing, even if it's a bit weird that John is mature enough to have a relationship last four years but not enough to not screw things up at his job or avoid giving in to Ted's peer pressure. The animations for Ted were of a good quality, doing a good job in making it seem like Ted was actually there with the actors, rather than just a computer - generated 3D image."
8017,"And, really, the modern shows make a lot more coherent sense than MDJ ever did. If you like documentaries, television, or reality TV, this is a good one to see. The Morton Downey Jr. show at its peak was a bold experiment in audience participation - the one criteria for the show's production seemed to be to get the audience to actively participate in the harshest and loudest way possible. The things that made the MDJ Show popular for a time were the same things that eventually buried it. But a figure like Bill O'Reilly, in particular, owes a tremendous debt to Downey's confrontational, damn - the - torpedoes style of doing "" news "" and interviews."
7856,"You may recall a major hit a few years ago entitled KNOCKED UP by Director Judd Apatow. And--if you like coincidences, you will love this--Mann herself turned 40 years old the same year that this film was made. The only really good part was during the credits when Melissa McCarthy has a bit from their outtakes. In fact, she steals entire scenes from Meghan Fox. There are moments of farce, slapstick, and outrageous humor, surrounded by moments where things just happen."
7857,"When the inevitable does happen, the following 15 minutes are intense, realistic and terrifying; an onslaught of terrific practical effects and incredible sound design. The actual Thai locations and the many Thai actors keep the production values superb, and give this film an authenticity it would not otherwise have. But his scenes of its striking are horrific enough to give some sense of its magnitude, even on the screen. The foley and special effect work providing suitably grisly and very believable sound effects and wounds. Director Juan Antonio Bayona vividly shares the shocking and yet, miraculous story of the Alvarez family."
7858,"There are some very strong performances here. Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, and Samantha Barks were all especially good. Everything from the acting to the music to the sets was borderline perfect. The intense emotions their characters experience throughout the story are perfectly performed. So many of the acting choices were brilliant and subtle."
7859,"And that's not just the stars, although they create wonderfully satisfying characters: the "" minor "" characters are also perfectly realised. The moments are there, you just have to know people - humanity. There is also another "" star "" in residence brilliantly cast with Dame Gweneth Jones. As it turns out, the film - set in a retirement home for classical musicians - is simply perfect: touching and amusing from the start, with generous but judicious doses of lovely music, shifting gears in an in - obtrusively sure - footed way. As one would expect from a director who is a great actor himself, the palette of characters here is vividly and colorfully incarnated by actors who are often memorable even in the most minor parts."
7863,"The challenges should be new, inventive and unforeseeable to be impacting but none of the options are very original. It is suspenseful from the outset and has lots of twists and turns to keep you jumping. Combining something as elegant as a dinner party with the crude tasks forced up the guests produces a uniquely creepy atmosphere and it is pretty much all the movie has going for itself. But as the evening draws further, Iris and the others will be forced to make decisions inflicting unspeakable pain towards the other participants. He commands a presence at the top of the table and his evil is believable in large thanks to his charismatic and demented portrayal of sadistic Shepard Lambrick."
7864,"The fights are well choreographed, plus the shootouts are tense, imaginative and highly effective. What is on the menu for viewers however, is a fast paced, brutal and highly enjoyable 98 minutes of mayhem. Waxman's style is direct, straightforward, free of flashy gimmicks and all about the action. As for loyal, existing fans of the two big guys, Maximum Conviction is absolutely essential viewing. Seagal's fight sequences are the best he's delivered in a number of years."
7865,"8 out of 10 brings IMDb's rating system into utter disrepute. Grumpy Billy Crystal has some funny moments. They deliver strong performances and have great timing, and it is a pity that the source material is so weak to begin with. But everything in between was pitch - perfect - a tremendously accurate (if only slightly over-the-top) portrayal of multi-generational families, their dynamics, and the outcomes that can occur when folks empty their pockets of defense - mechanisms. Maybe the courses on movie making should modify their guidelines to include what the general public considers a good movie."
7866,"The best way to describe JOHN DIES AT THE END is this: it feels like a 100 - minute trailer for a really awesome six - hour movie. John Dies at the End is told mostly as a story as the main character, Dave, recounts his adventures to a journalist. More questions than answers with the plot, but at least some of the humor works well. There is some good humor here and some of the scenes make you laugh (the meat man being one). In a world full of kissing vampires and "" found Footage "" crap, "" John "" bring to the screen what seems to have been lost since great films like Altered States, and Videodrome."
7867,"Numerous accomplices implicated all five defendants; both Richardson and McCray admitted participation and Salaam and Wise, admitted being present and Santana observed some "" commotion "" in the distance. A civil lawsuit is still pending, with all defendants seeking compensation. Reality is The Central Park Five's reason for being and one of the best documentaries in recent years. In reality, there was a six week pre-trial hearing involving testimony from twenty - nine prosecution witnesses, testimony from Wise, Richardson, Santana and Salaam, Lopez, parents, siblings, relatives and friends of the defendants. If they actually did participate in the mob violence that night, some attention might have been usefully paid to the whole issue of how seemingly otherwise good kids from poor but stable homes with fathers present in their lives can get caught up in that kind of lawlessness."
7868,"It keeps your attention with a brisk pace and an energetic soundtrack that matched the feel of the scene Had the script been a bit more supportive on some biographies, you would feel for the characters as more than just expendable fodder for the Collector. It could've definitely had an "" Ocean's Eleven "" or "" Smokin Aces "" like quality to it, which would've made the story more interesting. "" The Collection "" is a fun, gory time at the movies. Everything is bigger, bloodier and more gruesomely entertaining (if you're a horror fan). An incredible body count that would draw the attention of the CIA, FBI, and any local police much less the Criminal Minds - type teams."
7869,"Very will scripted by Krasinski and Damon. If you don't see it in a theater it will play well on DVD. A well researched scene featuring Hal Halbrook would have done the movie a world of good. The dialogue is more than believable, and both Matt Damon and John Kransinski both do a wonderful job in conveying their character's qualities and aspirations. "" Steve Butler (Damon) is a salesman working for Global, a natural gas company."
7734,"On the Pulp: early on it's clear the typically amazing Mr. Del Toro's performance is derived from Silent's mustachioed villains. This thrilling film contains noisy action, lots of violence, sexual scenes, plot twists and unpleasant characters. Colorful cinematography by Daniel Mindel, this is Oliver Stone's first film in nearly 17 years to be photographed with Panavision anamorphic lenses. Benicio Del Toro was wonderful as a psychotic cartel underboss, John Travolta chewed the scenery to bits, and Salma Hayek was entirely believable in her role as well. Â¨ Savages Â¨ is realized in frenetic style and fast - pace, similarly other Stone hits such as Â¨ Natural born killers Â¨ or Â¨ U turn Â¨."
7705,"Kahaani is one such film; everything's right about it. The locales of Kolkata are a treat to the eye. With Five brilliant performances in a row, she is unstoppable. Crisp dialogs, backed by wonderful performance just makes it all the more better. Brilliant script followed with top notch direction, editing, cinematography and performances."
7872,"The immigrants have become the new working class. But above all, Ã„ta Sova DÃ¶ is a unique portrait of a female character. Nermina Lukac does a great job, and the film won the four most important Guldbagge prizes in 2012, well deserved. The film is shot documentary style with hand held camera and the performances, specially that of Nermina Lukac, are very natural and totally believable. This is a glimpse into real working life Sweden, and real life for the many immigrants to the Nordic countries."
7755,"Okay, well, that's the solid base in which you can build anything. The performances were genuine and charming, with an undeniable likable cast. The use of songs fits this film like a glove and went with the flow. Rashida and Andy Samberg are incredible together. It's a funny and insightful film and both Jones and Samberg shine in it."
7874,"An important movie of a time lost, to the "" new "" technology of the gen - X. No cell phones, no computers. There are 14 class act performers, plus one. which pays homage to some of the great train scenes from older suspense films like North by Northwest. Too many modern thrillers like this try to make every beat into a high emotion scene, or build around the twist so it's as dramatic as possibly. At the age of 76 (and yes, despite being fit and well put together, he really does look his age), Redford is at least ten years older than his role would demand."
7733,It is amazing the intensity and depth they bring to their performances. He layered his role with some interesting nuances. It is a joy watching these two outstanding thespians at work. The young actor Michael Hall D'Addario was absolutely wonderful. It proves that in life a family always have life altering choices to make.
7876,"He speaks his mind, often in hilarious bursts of profanity. The sparing use of beautiful and rather poetic animation works very well, and Jay Bulger himself refrains from including himself too much in the finished film - and when he does take centre stage for a moment, it's an extraordinary (and violent! ) But it's the filmmaking that also shines here, pairing with the drummer's tales in perfect synchronization. This is especially surprising coming from first - time filmmaker, Rolling Stone writer and ex-boxer Jay Bulger. His drum battles with the primo jazz drummers of the day - Elvin Jones, Art Blakey, Phil Seaman - are ear - poppingly wonderful."
7699,"The major sequences move quickly into one another, fitting some positive character and theme - building moments in between. The 3D is one of the rare instances where it enhances the visuals and action rather than detract from it. The songs featured are fun and memorable. The henchmonkey chase is pretty great however. The 3D is pretty good, but even in 2D the film is still wonderful to watch."
7756,"Robert Emms, so often an invisible supporting actor, is breath - drawingly good as the mentally ill, victimized Rick who struggles to cope with the various warzones into which he is cast. Archie is clearly a man with great pressure in an unenviable situation but he doesn't simply make the best of it, he endeavours to make it the best it can be. Every member of each family is broken in some way and the manner in which these pieces of shattered lives influence each other makes for some of the most profoundly moving scenes and themes ever filmed. In contrast, Kasia (Zana Marjanovich), the friend who lives with Archie as a cross between friend, auntie and surrogate mother, brings a gentle, caring irreverence in the midst of the turmoil but she, too, has her' edge . ' Teacher Mike can teach courage but can't marshall his own to commit to his love Kasia (Zena Marjanovic) until it's too late."
7732,"Oh --- the central character is a very graceful and beautiful young child actress, QuvenzhanÃ© Wallis. As Hushpuppy says, "" The entire world depends on everything fitting together just right . "" Beasts of Southern Wild is an unique vision that sweeps viewers away with energy, attitude and a full, vibrant, sense of life. However, this film offers none of these qualities. Now they do have affordable cameras that will compensate for motion and can give you a nice, steady shot."
7879,"Everything Or Nothing is also well produced and stylishly done. This part of the story is greatly enhanced by the daughters. These two women are as beautiful as any of the ladies who've filled the ranks. Superb use of Barry music throughout to accompany the narrative, and clips from the films to illustrate events. A character that is able to win over just about any women, stand tall and overcome just about any obstacles not matter how much the odds are against him."
7757,"There is some great stunts, its far fetched but its crazily fast. Some of these parts are cleverly thought out and also quite funny in parts. This is one of those rare late summer releases that comes out of nowhere and entertains you way more than you could have expected. There's some contemporary visuals including route planning graphics and slow motion escape paths, which further the excitement. It's simply a fun, fast, and intense 90 - minute ride that's equal parts tension and comic relief."
7881,"all the performances were terrific, subtle as the story unfolds. This film not only succeeds as a film that belongs with the others mentioned, but it is really an impressive film. The performances are top - notch, but there are ellipsis (or cuts in the edition) that are confusing. The multi-dimensional layers of the Northern Ireland troubles offer rich pickings to thriller writers. The lighting, scenery, costumes and photography, and background music all contribute to the film in a way that one expects of a great film about Britain in the 90s."
7882,"It is an astonishing technique and Lindhardt gives a mesmerizing performance. The acting was spot - on, particularly from Thure Lindhardt, and the portrayals were entirely believable. She brings a natural, lived - in quality to their scenes together. Handsome, charismatic Lindhardt is well - cast, as a non-native trying to make it in New York. Thure Lindhardt is at the center of this film and he's really its only saving grace."
7883,"Finally, at Middle Tennessee State College he met some kindred spirits who were into the creative arts and their bonding helped him immensely. White was stunned that his teacher was there, whom in the early segments of the movie he had shown in a class picture and mentioned that he had "" loved "" her and how supportive she was to him. His creations, his drive, and his independent spirit are truly inspiring. They have been going strong now for 27 years of marriage, with Mimi being the perfect steadying force for him. This success has led to his appearing at book signings and talks across the country."
7731,"The vivid colors and the "" just right "" graphical presentation is sure a feast on the eyes. Kids loved it and plenty there for the adults to relate to and enjoy as well. And the movie kinda opens doors to new additional sequels. It's just that the previous Ice Age movies seemed to have something for people of all ages to enjoy. Even in the Ice Age predecessors, he was always the funniest."
7758,"Both LaBoeuf and Pearce deliver some standout performances in Lawless. The recreation of Prohbition era rural Virginia is well done. The cast was strong and all delivered good performances, especially Tom Hardy, who once again showed how much of a versatile actor he is. Lawless was extremely well filmed, looked great and stayed true to year it was set in. Gary Oldman is always a pleasure to watch and Mia Wasikowska is lovely and does the most with the little she was given."
7886,"Ben Wheatley provides one of the year's darkest and funniest comedies in this tale of true love, caravans and dead bodies. Films like "" Sightseers "" are tough to categorize, and even tougher to recommend. Sightseers is typically British dark comedy. To be honest, Sightseers isn't right for many people at all; it's what you might call a niche film. It's a minor criticism and a great pity because whenever the dialogue and performances are restrained to levels of naturalism, and that occurs for a good 95% of the film, Sightseers flies."
7759,"Ving Rhames was back and that was just delightful. At points you could tell the piranha's were puppets, and the puns were cheesy one liners at best. The bedroom scene is one of the best scenes ever. Danielle Panabaker is great as the lead and done well with this film. So if you find gratuitous blood, body parts and boobs (and screaming) hilarious, this movie is worth a look over a beer and popcorn."
7888,"second, it's a drama with moments of levity. Eisenberg is able to make a couple of scenes very funny. There are indeed some very funny moments, many of them physical in nature, and yet never once does the humor overshadow the story's innate humanity. In the former, he played a dramatized version of Mark Zuckerberg, a young man whose focus was so narrow and intense that Asperger's was certainly within the realm of possibility. Presumably a comedy, the movie goes to great lengths to create a story full of comedic mishaps."
8050,"One of the best movies of the year. Highly recommended to the lovers of quality and Kim Ki - Duk movies. It is a rare quality to be able to find beauty in the most harsh places and to somehow convey this strange beauty to the screen. At the expense of being confused and tortured with puzzling metaphors, you could reach the land of poetic beauty and religious purification. He can make an audience relate to his characters even though they are immoral and almost heartless human beings, doing this with so much ease is remarkable."
8051,"And the Fraternity of the participants is absolutely one of the greatest messages that comes out. Double - blind tastings have as much relevance to real, hands - on restaurant work as the Zodiac does to Astronomy. 3 stars out of 10 for some pretty filmography, and a nice original soundtrack. There's a couple of slow moments but overall this keeps moving by portraying the toll on relationships and the character of all concerned. Alexander Payne's 2004 hit Sideways made wine tasting and discussion a fun thing to do with friends, and U. S. wine tours exploded."
7889,"The film is quite light hearted, considering its content and, at times is comical. The performances can be a bit stilted, yet Tim seems to carry the whole thing on his own and makes it worth watching. Special mention to the location scout who has found some truly outstanding filming locations around the north of England to set some of the action in. If you like one of them smart little films with no extra fuzz, just great talent, this is it! Both lead actors play their parts quite well and create an enjoyable partnership."
7891,"Walken plays a great role at gluing everything together. This is a gem of a Movie and brings back a touch of the real movies of yesteryear. The soundtrack of blues greats and Jon Bon Jovi songs is perfectly on point. The film has a nice genuine feel about it, great story, great acting and a great soundtrack that compliments the film and characters! Understated, extremely fine acting make this one of the best films of Walken's or Pacino's careers."
7892,"Coupled with the storyline, it inspires one to live their lives fully, as most great films do! The film's beautiful cinematography and skillful storytelling bring to light issues of poverty, fear, religion, and humanity. CMK is a story of courage and love. The courage of the local LGBTI people is amazing. The parallels with other such battles are eerie, but the success of many of these past struggles leave the viewer hopeful that good will eventually triumph in this battle as well."
7718,"But if you take it as fun movie, fulled of action / fantasy / horror scenes and as what it is then you can give it a chance. It takes you and makes you part of the scenes and is recommended although some of the scenes would make the 3D a nuisance. And the 3D is often very effective. Like director Timur Bekmambetov's earlier Wanted, it is an unexpected and exuberant batch of utter twaddle, made with an almost palpable glee. The movie moves along at a good pace."
7760,"If there were some downsides they would be first that, visually it's nothing special, it looks good but not great. Mike Birbiglia who is a good comedian makes a comedy movie, is has to be good! Almost every scene was tightly edited to show this, and the performances were deeply funny and heartbreaking. All in all, the movie is an honest, lighthearted look at an event from Mike Birbiglia's life. His beautiful, successful, and goal - driven girlfriend is left in his wake, and his well - meaning parents are treated like jerks."
7761,"Though it reveals its secrets slowly, when it hits you, it is with an astonishing burst of power that you can feel in your bones. The sound tracks are really wonderful and take you back to the 60s and 70s. Searching for Sugar Man is one of the best films of the year. Aside from the unbelievable story, the cinematography had some very great moments and not to mention a stellar sound track. The delights of "" Searching for Sugar Man "" are revealed along the way, as the story unspools over decades and continents."
7895,"Cocker, new addition to the Galactica universe, and performed by Cotton, brings a more mature tone to the story. Purchase the full extended cut when it's released in February; it'll be worth it, especially since the series is getting better with every segment released on Machinima. The actors are great and also storyline is very good for a first episode. Perfect actors, good cgi and a terrific story. For something that was made to air over the internet and be released on disc a few months later, Battlestar Galactica: Blood and Chrome is a spectacular and valiant effort that comes out on top."
7697,"Chris Hemsworth was compelling (in a vacuum) and the dwarfs (casting controversy aside) were engaging. Meanwhile William (Sam Claflin) learns that Snow White is alive and he heads to join Finn's men to meet her. The story is excellent, despite minor flaws like for example Snow White running and swimming after years imprisoned in a dirty tower, and is supported by a great screenplay, magnificent cinematography and CGI and good acting. Ravenna imprisons Snow White on the Northern Tower of the castle while William, his father The Duke and a few survivors escape from the castle. Either lower your expectations or skip this one entirely."
8059,"The characters shine - all of the strawhats - luffy, usopp, nami, franky, brook, chopper, sanji, zoro and robin. Well, If you think this movie is anything other than the TV Animation, it will be great, exciting, and entertaining one! It was Kuzan that stopped the Dyna rocks (by freezing) and the marines that killed Z. Luffy, Robin, Brook and Chopper have special powers derived from eating Devil Fruits. The angles and camera movements following every scene was done fluidly."
7762,Calis is terrific in her bit as the young girl who finds herself falling apart. It has some jumpy moments for those who aren't desensitised to the ways of a horror movie but mainly it's gripping and you want to find out what's in that box. Morgan is good in the lead and Natasha Calis is also impressive in the pivotal creepy role. Ole Bornedal's Direction is a plus - point. The movie plays out like a pretty routine possession movie but it does have some pretty nice scares in it and the dybbuk storyline is interesting.
7752,"Various sounds and sensations make it clear that he's in the trunk of a car, which is now on the move. Special attention was given to verbal communications to convey meaning and a big thumbs up for that. The story is fun to watch develop, full of twists and turns and witty dialogue that adds just that right amount of sarcasm to intense situations. For those of you that may not be a fan or don't know much about his work, this is really a movie to see, he brings everything to the screen. A lot of people have complained about the ending (or multiple endings) and the ability to predict some of the plot twists, like, before the prologue."
7898,"It opens your eyes to a world you may not have seen or entirely known before. Its ironic that children (here Prachi) actually justify it in spite of concrete evidence of psychological impacts in later life. "" The World Before Her "" raises a lot of poignant questions, and is worth checking out, be it in the theater, on DVD or on Amazon Instant Video. The movie stimulated many thoughts and emotions, it provided a very interesting look at the options and choices of the women of India. The World Before Her is one of the most significant, thought - provoking films in the recent times - one that shocks, saddens, amazes and leaves you with more questions than answers."
7899,"So yeah, easily one of the most important documentaries to come out this decade, if not this century. After over one - hundred years of cinema, it's pretty rare to come across a film unlike anything you've seen before, let alone one that begs the question: how the hell did they pull that off? That may be so, but if you are looking for a compelling counter-argument you can start with this film. This is also the ultimate film within a film, because it essentially lights the fire under the brew, which activates its potency and makes it go to its protagonists' heads. These squad leaders are still feared and celebrated, and their actions are institutionally supported, so, as a result, they get to run around patting themselves and each other on the back for their atrocities."
7900,"Final words: Tommy Wiseau's The Room is a helluva lot more entertaining than this Room was. It reveals little about Kubrick's vision or intent and everything about their specific and sometimes downright crazy views about the world as expressed through their interpretations of Kubrick's movie. A documentary on Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film The Shining, exploring possible hidden meanings, cryptic elements and alternative interpretations of the plot. The best line in the whole Doc comes near the end when one of the theorists admits that Kubrick may not have consciously intended for all these hidden meanings to be in his film, but that it didn't matter. There are many good ideas here, like the Impossible Window, or the Minotaur motif, and there are some great visual touches too, especially the graphics of the floor plans."
7751,"Chris Henchy & Shawn Harwell's Screenplay is funny & crisp. His iconic character was a slam - dunk on short SNL skits, but runs thin in a feature film. This one's a keeper for him but the real star of this movie is Zach Galifianakis who seems to replicate Jack Black's character in "" Bernie "" but with a completely different take. If your a fan of both Will Ferrell and Zach Galifanakis comedies you will definitely love the Campaign. Among the supporting cast, Jason Sudeikis is first - rate."
7902,"Whilst the nouvelle vague phenomenon continues in NY, it's seems Berlin, and Jan Ole Gerster actually has something to say. Great musical score by Cherilyn MacNeil and The Major Minors. Step by step the young guy's everyday - life situations pull you in, develop a light but melancholic atmosphere in which great acting, a pensive and funny script, music that reminds the best of Miles Davis and awesome black - and - white camera - work form a wonderful whole of a movie. All in all there are several minutes of lovely Berlin photography. If B&W - movies do have a future, the name of the cameraman Philipp Kirsamer is definitely one to remember."
7765,"On it's own, Bachelorette did really well. The most plainly excellent detail is that the plot is perfectly paced; in this respect it outdoes both Bridesmaids and The Hangover, the two films most frequently compared to it. Too bad her role necessitates under - utilizing her gifts. Check it out, it's a good laugh ride if you're into dark comedies. There was a wedding, two of the three leads end up in relationships, the transcendence of love is affirmed."
7696,"Anyway, this was a very entertaining film and you will be glad that you saw it in 3D. In this sequel, it's pretty small and unnecessary but it still has the charms and bright imagination. The films primary achievement and a true signal of its return to form though are the scenes set in the past. The Smith & Jones pairing is augmented by Brolin who gives a good representation of how K would be in the Sixties, with most of the sequences accompanied by popular Sixties hits on the soundtrack. ABSOLUTELY NO REASON to see it in 3D."
7904,"Wadjda is a hero in any culture. For the record, director Haifaa Al - Mansour is a first female director in Saudi Arabian and is considered one of the most prolific movie makers in the Kingdom. This is a subtle tale full of character, charm and complexities and not at all as one might expect. Haifaa Al - Mansour depicts the life of females in Saudi - Arabia in a very compelling manner. Quirky and witty, this is a delight and one should not allow any preconceived notions of Arabic culture to stand in the way of enjoying this pleasurable debut."
8072,"It is a different story, but it's more of the genius Anno building on the core concepts that made Evangelion the classic it is. The Rebuild saga blazes onward in Anno's world flipping master act. Aside from the opening, the most exciting part of Rebuild of Evangelion 3. Although the story certainly spans all for movies, this felt like a baby step compared to the leaps and bounds that were 1. These are the best kinds of each."
7776,"Mihai Malaimare, Jr., cinematographer extraordinaire, is just that, extraordinary. Unquestionably P. T. Anderson's best film so far. His utter and complete immersion in the character of Freddie Quell has to be seen to be believed. But the highlight of the film is without a doubt Joaquin Phoenix's tremendous performance as Freddie Quell. There is also some great supporting work from Laura Dern and others."
7766,"It has the loner girl who doesn't want to try new things but then she gets involved with a group and she has friends, yay! Take Bring It On, Glee (not in the icky cheesy way, but because there's singing involved, the good kind), Mean Girls, and add some quick - witted, sharp - tongued dialogue and commentary, and you have the funniest of movies. "" Pitch Perfect "" vs. "" Glee "": The main reason "" Pitch Perfect "" works so well is actually quite simple. It's the "" group of teen misfits who band together and win a competition "" movie. In fact, from the non-stop laughs, to the quite satirical teenage dialogue, to the perfectly hilarious "" Best in Show "" - esque banter from Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins, who play the two commentators of the national a cappella competition, "" Pitch Perfect "", aside from a curiously abrupt ending, works on EVERY level; even in its rarest of sappy moments."
7730,"Osco's resident genius Dr. Curt Conner's transforms into The Lizard so quick, running amok New York City like a raptor on steroids, there's not much reason, or worthy motivation, for his actions. Other than that, it's a music video and it pulls NO surprises. It also lead to a superior sequel and the much maligned, though underrated, third episode. This film is essentially quite similar to 2002's film, but also features a few differences mainly a personality change in Peter. The Lizard, played wonderfully by Rhys Ifans, is a good villain to watch."
7767,"It's pretty long, well - shot (as is much of the film, incidentally), includes several creative elements, and is fast - paced and pays off well. the thing is though, is that they are doing a lot of movies along this same line. Even 2012 provided dozens much better action movies. Unfortunitly it didn't and car and phone adverts continued through the film. It plods along amiably enough for much of its length until the film's highlight, around 16 minutes from the end: a very well executed and imaginative car chase sequence."
7750,"The Opening Credits: Visually the opening sequence was absolutely brilliant. Everything looks stunning, perfectly placed and in balance yet urgent and explosive. ' Skyfall' fortunately, is a film that reaches up to that caliber. Other side of the camera the tech credits are high, with Deakins proving to be one of the aces in the pack. Smartly enough, everything is on an even keel - the action feels perfectly urgent but it does not stretch, the drama is poignant and painful, the humor comes in like a fresh breath into the taut proceedings and it all works impeccably as smoothly as the click of a mouse itself."
7692,The sets and costumes are excellent as is the cinematography. It's actually pretty good at recapturing the 70's. The supporting cast (almost all A-list with a young ChloÃ« Grace Moretz) is rock solid. The whole film felt like London in the 40's. Tim Burton is probably one of the best choices to direct a Dark Shadows movie.
7769,"To shine a light towards the possibly unseen both within popular entertainment films and the unseen films that push the art form forwards. Looper's first thirty minutes run by smoothly. Underneath the prosthetics though Gordon - Levitt delivers a fine performance, adopting a few of Willis' telltale mannerisms and affectations but avoiding pure mimicry. Sitting here the day after viewing Rian Johnson's Looper, parts of it are still falling in to place. The chemistry between the two leads was great and really helped with the believability of them being one person."
7910,"Still, there are some nice moments. Spring Breakers is a unique experience featuring lots of depth and style. It's truly one of the best films of 2013 (so far) and will no doubt be a cult classic in years to come. Overall, Spring Breakers is full of outstanding graphics, bright colors, provocative scenes, and young Disney turned Hollywood stars. It's nice that, later on in the film, the director shows some short moments of what happened inside the restaurant."
7770,"As a fan of movies such as Wedding Crashers, Old School, Step Brothers , 21 Jump Street, Superbad, and Forgetting Sarah Marshall just to name a few, this has to be the funniest movie out of the bunch. This is Adam Sandler at his raunchiest and funniest. But if you're an Adam Sandler fan who loves his earlier stuff, this one is right up there with Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore! It aims to go for the baddest of laughs, but due to the lack of discipline, plausibility in the writing (why isn't the baby given to child services? ) Had good feeling, good comedy, a solid entry to Sandlers recent works."
7717,"It will take you to wherever your heart desires. The Rome of Fellini with all its magic corners or Pasolini's Rome with its poetic darkness. As time passes Woody Allen is able to transform himself and his movies. A nation of wildly - gesturing people full of passion about everything--art, soccer, food, whatever--seems the perfect foil for all of Allen's self - centered New Yorkers. ( His worse film is Scoop) The whole cast works nicely and all the performances are all around great."
7913,"Great from start to finish, and different from most movies in that genre. The acting is this is really astonishing the chemistry between the two main characters is second to none, feels so real. They make the two characters blend so well together it's hard not to root for them to wind up together. Beautiful (literally) characters, witty dialogues, good background score and decent acting make this a great option for the rom - com genre fans. Both of the lead actors are beautiful, charismatic and especially the female lead, interesting personality."
7914,"Dehaan is definitely a rising star. The Place Beyond The Pines was a magnificent third feature from director Derek Cianfrance. Dane Dehaan plays an important role and does a great job of it. The performances were outstanding and it was a great story. It was intense, the dialogue with Ben Mendelsohns character was great."
7915,"Sooooo, that sounds like an interesting plot doesn't it? And there were also moments throughout the movie that were great and funny. It has heart, wit, intelligence, and humor almost bursting from its seams. The stars, Juno Temple and Michael Angarono were a great combination. Ramaa Mosley's debut film "" The Brass Teapot "" stands out as an enjoyable indie flick."
7719,"But as usual, in trademark style, he starts off blasÃ© and then explodes into passion and surprise. Hough and Boneta were fresh, talented and beautiful. A good couple of chuckles in there, and if you're over 35 years old. But, if you like the 80's and its music, you will probably enjoy this movie and leave with a smile. Cruise jumps into the Jaxx role with both feet and seems to understand that a parody should be fun."
7690,"Scott Hicks, who deservedly won plaudits for Shine and then ripped the hearts out of the adaptations for two superb novels (Snow Falling on Cedars and Hearts in Atlantis), again directs with a join - the - dots approach with similar results: Yes, you'll know what the picture is supposed to be but you won't want to frame it and hang it over the fireplace. A film made completely of "" romantic "" montages. The director Scott Hicks explores the beautiful landscapes with a wonderful cinematography. "" The Lucky One "" is a sweet and dramatic romance, with pleasant characters. The plot is very simple and predictable, but the chemistry among Zac Efron, Taylor Schilling, Blythe Danner and the boy Riley Thomas Stewart makes the film worth."
7720,"Steve Carell strengthens this to new extremes. That being said, the characters were developed well and Steve Carell and Keira Knightley's performances were great as well as their chemistry. Knightley serves as a great contrast to Carell in many ways, and she is a welcome presence in this movie. Very similar to Bill Murray's character in "" Lost In Translation "", Carell is great at conveying so much despite doing so little. The movie also boasts some rather great cameo appearances, all of whom really helped adding to the movie, by actors and actresses such as Rob Corddry, Patton Oswalt, William Petersen and, of course, Martin Sheen."
7772,It delivers first - rate performances by first - rate actors. First time director Jake Schreier reveals a mature ability to find the perfect pacing that develops the characters with ease and exact timing that turns the comedy bits into gold. It's a genuinely entertaining character study set in the next 50 years that manages to be both funny and surprisingly touching. Robot and Frank is up there with the best robot movies out there. Writer Christopher D. Ford pens his rare tale set sometime in the ambiguous near future.
8095,"The events presented in the movie are far from being convincing. Yeah, it has a few' highlight' moments which are worth. It's not the best timing with Liotta, close to proposing to his new love, Vanessa Gray, one of the better performers. This movie is worth watching if you don't expect much and if you're interested in the violent world of drugs and crime. During the years that past while Mack is behind the prison walls Molloy's near fatal heart attack gives him a wake up call and he cleans up his act and moves in with a lovely woman who owns a women's clothing store."
7773,"Ai Weiwei lived in New York from 1983 to 1993 where he studied and worked as an artist. The opening scenes show one of Weiwei's cats, who has learned to jump high and put his weight on a door handle and open the door, which is pretty amazing. If these extraordinary activists prove anything at all, it is that one's power and influence can indeed transcend the boundaries of a governmental gag order. It was beautiful and frighteningly ugly to see Ai Weiwei's story. Klayman has made an immensely entertaining picture that garners a great deal of its mileage from the irrepressible charisma of Ai Weiwei himself, who subsequently appeared in his own send - up of PSY's "" Gangnam Style "" video."
7774,"The story is just, for lack of a more sophisticated word, DUMB. Gone is the fun and it's been replaced with ritzy production values and no discernible storyline. The final fight is like a raping of your mind - too much FX's, too less reality and common sense, it's against everything good in the world. Just make a REAL Resident Evil movie for the love of everything holy. Honestly if you enjoyed all the former movies and you consider them "" part of their own story "" meaning that your pretty much ignoring the video games when watching the movies then you'll find yourself even more amazed by how terrible this movie is."
7954,"Some important aspects to Legs were left out as well. The pros of the 2014 film, It is a lot closer to the book, except two or three scenes that were in the weren't in the film, (which may be a good thing) The cons of the 2014 film, Goldie is a lot less likable in the 2014 film vs the 1996 film, the tattoo scene in the 2014 film is non-nude. With so many lousy films and independent attempts that are failures, it was a pleasure to be rewarded with this viewing. She was high - voiced and matter of fact most of the time, showing little exuberance of Legs or charismatic posture or gestures or even facial expressions. Legs was in the book described basically as a wild - haired, bonier teenage Angelina Jolie, as beautiful and bold - featured but androgynous, always dressing in men's clothing and so uncomfortable with her femininity that she actually bound her breasts."
7829,"Better than both films, IMO, this will live on with DVD and Blu - ray releases, thankfully. However for fans of Simon Pegg and his movies this will be a real treat. "" A Fantastic Fear of Everything "" is an incredibly well - done film from start to finish. This one may be very much enjoyed by a smaller audience, even after several viewings. A Fantastic Fear of Everything is probably not what you're expecting from Simon Pegg."
7544,"This remarkable movie easily fulfilled and then exceeded all expectations. That is where Whedon deserves the most credit. The pathos is there but so are the timing and true deep performances. Marvel did it, they pulled off the culmination of a master plan that's been taking shape for years. The cast does a great job of bringing these iconic characters to life, beginning with Robert Downey Jr. ."
7600,"He connects the dots and meets Sly. Jason Momoa is decent as the killer. Kang makes a great sidekick and Momoa is an awesome bad guy. There are more triple - taps to the head than any film in recent memory, to the point that it becomes rather over the top by the time the film ends All that said, Walter Hill has woven yet another well - paced, engrossing buddy film actioner with a pretty good left hand twist. It's very much a buddy - cop film and co-star Kang provides plenty of thrills himself."
7601,"thank god, more locations, funnier and better put together. Crews and Courture again get short shifted and feel like background characters. Everybody is clearly having a blast, so in translation, so do you, of particular note, Jean Claude Van Damme provides a standout performance as sneery and arrogant Jean Villain. It is greatly entertaining if you are looking for an action packed movie loaded with iconic action stars like Stallone, Willis and many more. A lot of money that could have fed a lot of poor people gone up in flames."
7689,"It was funny, charming, and full of really great moments. But if you must classify it as such, then know that this movie breaks Tyler Perry's stronghold and breaks out of the Madea mold of what Black entertainment is. His comic timing and expressions are priceless. The cast is beautiful, the emotions are spot - on all through the film. Even though Cedric was the funniest character in the movie, all the others always had something pretty funny to say."
7775,"Enter the classic coming - of - age, finding yourself stuff, the "" choosing to be alive "" as Lola phrases it. Greta Gerwig is enchanting in the lead role, and her delightful comedic mannerisms and facial expressions are perfect for this wry comedy. Directed by Daryl Welin and opens on June 15, Lola Versus is a fun adventure. She lives in a perfect, rent - controlled apartment and is engaged to uber stud, Luke (Kinnaman). The story seems true to the complications of modern romantic entanglements and the two main actresses are great."
7704,"Stylistically, it may be Anderson's most masterful work, as the costumes, sets, and settings transport the viewer to an alternate universe, a place of wonder and adventure. All of this is established in one long sequence of beautiful camera movements which last no longer than a couple of minutes. There is a vague pastel and brown tint to everything which matches the film's period setting. They have obvious intelligence and wisdom but convey it through a child's eyes. The score goes perfectly with the on screen action and features a mixture of militaristic marching music, classical and 60s pop."
7688,"Several good points are made and good analogies used. A few funny moments, but problems of both pacing and tone are fatal, as are the silly Brit stereotypes, the silly Jewish stereotypes, the silly "" clueless straight guy "" stereotypes. This is partially because the film, while billed as a romantic comedy, is only funny in spurts. There are risks when romantic comedy is injected with "" truth . "" Then just as quickly, the movies introduces some wild slapstick in which Violet gets shot with an arrow and slammed with a car door; while Tom wanders out on a freezing night, suffers frostbite and loses a toe (this is supposed to be laugh - inducing?"
7777,"The effect is striking and believable, like everything else in this film. Visually arresting and with a sensible running time, Dredd rocks. Obviously there's a bit more to it than that, but this is the basic set up and it works very well indeed, allowing for plenty of violence, some character development and no few explosions. The supporting cast are all excellent, and they all give great performances and have strong characters to work with. The 3D is actually worth shelling out for, and there are some beautiful sequences where it comes into it's own, whilst the film itself is gritty and dirty, although not without a few lighter moments amidst the carnage."
7602,"Hope the sequels are as good as this. One extra point for silly costumes and crazy haircuts. There is a lot of similar movies (TV show that will be survived only by the sole victor) and every single of them is more thrilling. At one point out of the blue she finds herself in the middle of fiery doom, with fireballs launching at her, she barely survives. As the game progresses the rules begin to change to attain an ending which is pleasing to the masses, rather than those "" playing "" the game, and new elements are thrown in to ensure excitement and "" fun "" for the viewers."
7604,"On top of all this, everyone's bandwagoning on thinking it's great because it's "" supposed "" to be great, right? Since the last movie it's been 7 years and Batman has been in seclusion since then. No longer a dunderhead "" enforcer "", but one of the criminal masterminds behind "" Gotham's Reckoning "", coupled with a physical dominance strong enough to send shivers down your spine. Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard), who encourages Bruce Wayne to rejoin the rest of the world and continue his father's philanthropic work. The movie's soundtrack is terrific and really exemplify's many of the movie's scenes."
7685,"Hell, in the credits it's "" Based on the game by Hasbro, "" so go in prepared and enjoy. Neeson is decent as the admiral or whatever, and even Rihanna does an acceptable job. If you just want to have a good time, have some laughs, see some great special effects and walk away from a movie with a smile on your face, go see this movie. There are some TERRIBLE comic scenes, like the one where the guy is stealing a burrito for his bigtittied trophy."
7605,"The performances, though, are very good. The extraordinary Rachel Weisz brings a complex role into the realm of credibility. Renner and Weisz are absolutely perfect in their roles. Outcome is an affiliate of Blackbriar and Treadstone, with one significant difference however. Rachel Weisz is one of the most versatile, gifted and complex actors working today."
7922,"Cimatography is excellent in Dark Tide. The character drama and the relationships between the characters was well developed. The story is realistic, unlike others like "" Deep Blue Sea "" this one is not a Hollywood exaggeration. The dynamic between the characters is amazing, and the characters really cause you to believe that this might actually happen. Boat skippers have wind - washed complexions."
7779,"Gyllenhaal and Pena had very good chemistry and worked off of each other well. The important thing though is that the film is able to balance all of these moments so well. The casting in this movie is picture perfect, with each actor giving in depth performances. Gyllenhaal continues to solidify himself as one of the best actors around and PeÃ±a delivers one of his best performances to date. It easily has the most likable characters, and as such the most emotional involvement for the audience, which thus creates the most tension in the high risk, action scenes."
7684,"In "" Mirror Mirror "", there are some moments that kids will have fun with. This movie was entertaining for any age, full of action, surprises and humor. It's a fun, heart - filled escapist artwork, good for more than a few viewings. Of the other characters - as has been noted Snow White stole the show and was a capable lead and will doubtless go on to far grander things. Her dedication to what could have been a phoned - in ingÃ©nue is actually rather impressive."
7618,"Touching at times and funny too! The stories are touching and show great sensitivity. Keke Palmer is just awesome as Latifahs daughter. Queen Latifah is perfect in this role. The plot has some definite misses, it was predictable and cheesy at times, but it was fun!"
7624,"Overall, it's a good enough movie for people who like these kinds of movies. Worthington, Banks, Bell and the rest do the best with their parts though and it's nice to see Worthington continue to branch out a little. There were good shots from the' ledge' and some good action scenes that were nice at the theater. There were great characters in the crowd, News team and your typical good / bad cops, Swat and Tactical teams. Go see it if you like action / thriller movies!"
7926,"As part of Madman Entertainment's Reel Anime Festival that now come very two years since 2008. In the vein of films like Totoro, and in contrast to Mamoru Hosoda's previous Summer Wars, this film glides along without an epic struggle driving the story. It touches your heart, not with big moments, but with small ones. It did not look like an anime movie, it looked almost a real one with many cool and colourful frames. The story is almost too ordinary, but in its normality, its moments are universal."
7780,"It wasn't anything spectacular, but it was enjoyable and well written. Let it be known, that it's strictly boobs--and stealing creepy tapes--from here on out. V / H / S brings the format into the new age by unfolding its tales by wrapping around the latest craze of found footage. Each and every one delivers the goods in this respect and that's half the battle when it comes to horror flicks. Amateur Night (David Bruckner) and The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger (Joe Swanberg) are the standouts."
7781,It really has the power to convey real feelings to the watcher. The entire cast is wonderful and Vinterberg's direction and writing are spot on. In an adult with twenty years experience on the big screen it would be a breathtaking performance; that this is the debut of a young child is staggering. Natural lighting is used to match the heights and depths of the kindergarten children's emotions. The Hunt is drama at its best with beautiful performances from the entire cast.
7782,"Even for the sheer beauty of the shots, which combine the technical precision of someone who truly understands lighting and optics with the poetic abstraction of a surrealist painting, this film is worth watching. This is essentially an art - house film, but unlike unlike other such films this is full of comedy, some subtle and some proper laugh - out - loud moments. The film is enjoyable however you view it and whether or not you read into any hidden messages or not. Finding beauty or love in something and enjoying it is always a lovely and inspired reaction for anyone to have to anything, regardless of how others feel about it. It has enough quiet moments to make you impatient, but from the pause it will take off on another romp."
7632,"The only flight sequences which are realistic are the landing and take - off scenes. The history of the Tuskegee Airmen is a great story to tell but this movie did a disservice and all too predictable. He just makes his CGI airplanes do anything he wants them to do to fit his fantasies and fiction. Characters that had no place being there, in particular the Italian love interest of one of the pilots. The promise in RED TAILS fictionally given by Colonel Bullard (actually a thinly disguised version of the real - life Colonel Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.) to reduce bomber losses by 70 - 80% was in real life fulfilled by all American fighter pilots in the European Theater."
7783,Whoever did his make - up did a darn good job. Derek Luke was solid and Tika Sumpter was awesome. Jordin Sparks did very well as Sparkle. It had a lot of memorable one liners and great comebacks. The oh so gorgeous Jordin Sparks and talented Derek Luke played the roles of Sparkle and Stix wonderfully.
7634,"The pace was rapid and the scenes were captured realistically (good editing . ) Lula the street' ho' was perfectly cast, as were Stephanie's cousin Vinnie and the girl in the bail bond office who Janet Evanovich describes as carrying most of her weight in her chest. She has shown over the years that she knows how to properly illustrate complicated characters. Katherine Heigl is excellent in the role of Stephanie Plum. This adaptation of Janet Evanivich's book is well done and a lot of fun."
7931,"Reese nails the part, and is gorgeous to boot. And this was Matthew McConaughey's best job EVER. McConaughey is well cast and acquits himself well, with a thoughtful layered performance that goes well beyond the stereotypes you might expect. An exquisite piece of filmmaking from writer - director Jeff Nichols, bolstered by powerful performances from Matthew McConaughey, Reece Witherspoon, Sam Shephard, Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland. It's a real movie about people, and a place--not car chases and explosions."
7636,"Dane DeHaan, Alex Russell, Michael B. Jordan give great, convincing performances. It helps that the leads do a great job in their respective roles. That along with the well - written script and performances, made "" Chronicle "" all the more enjoyable and engrossing. Dane DeHaan gives a great rage to Andrew. Chronicle is an engaging offspring of two very separate genres."
7784,Istanbul a popular tourist city is full of slums and women covered in burqas. Mostly people in USA drive Automatic cars and the girl didn't pass driving test 2 times but The girl drives a manual car perfectly in Turkey.
7642,""" Safe House "" is a exhilarating action thriller with explosive stunts and sequences. Next to Liam Neeson's The Grey, this is one of the best action movies so far this year. This is the first mainstream feature for Daniel Espinosa and he comes forth as promising due to his skillful camera work with the action scenes. The locations are interesting and the movie takes place in Cape Town in South Africa and not in Europe or North America. The fighting and action scenes are very well done and with the visual and sound effects in cinema, it's a pleasant entertainment to watch this movie for sure."
7643,"There were so many interesting possibilities that a memory - loss movie could pursue. Details are revealed to you layer by layer as Paige discovers them. The cast is great, with Jessica Lange, Sam Neill and Scott Speedman in supporting roles. The fact that the setting was clearly Chicago without any effort to try and hide street signs and restaurant placards only added to the charm and believability of the movie. There were plenty of cute moments that make you say, "" ahhhhhh . """
8539,"This makes a concerted effort to be a unique and original sex comedy, with the sexy scenes and the off - color banter a mainstream romantic comedy would have had. Lets hope someone can eventually make a gay romantic comedy with the quality of a You've Got Mail or a classic like Charade. This is the type of comedy that might appeal to Will and Grace fans. Certainly a film for the steadfast romantic who believes true love conquers all, the premise is outrageous then unfolds with a series of farcical scenes climaxing with "" the moment of knowing . "" Films like Plan B, Patrik 1."
8198,"It is beautifully animated, the sceneries are not as stunning as those of Tangled but they are still beautiful, it all looks very colourful and the characters are very well modelled. This was very funny from beginning to end what with all the fast - paced gags that abounded. When Nathan Greno and Byron Howard (With the help of a cadre of Disney's finest) created the original Tangled, it was spectacular. The 3D is (with one minor exception) not abused, as was the case in the first film, but rather totally immersive. A feast fit for kings and queens of all ages."
8071,"It is perfect for the viewers around the age of 12. Any of the jumpy scenes could easily have been chucked in from the first. The reasoning for the 3 of 10 rating is, it starts out good, and has decent special effects for a low budget movie. It had its moments, its thrills, and its flaws, like any other horror movie. The movie was a success at conveying the sinister nature of the ghosts beautifully."
7646,"While Ari Graynor has the better role to play, Lauren Miller manages to prove she shares a sense of lowbrow humour with her husband (Rogen), who cameos in one of the film's most memorable scenes. The other well - documented cameo with Seth Rogen isn't nearly as funny because it is also supposed to serve as plot advancement. Cameo's with Seth Rogen and Kevin Smith were hilarious. Some of the best bits happen when Lauren and Katie talk to their customers. Resorting to phone sex to help pay the bills in their city apartment, Lauren and Katie - two completely opposite personalities - bond despite a teenage feud still lingering."
7647,"The previews for Journey 2: The Mysterious Island made it look better than it actually was. "" Journey 2: The Mysterious Island "" is a movie with a trailer that is better than the film itself. They find a beautiful and dangerous place, surrounded by forests, volcanoes with lava of gold and menacing life forms. Dwayne "" The Rock "" Johnson and Josh Hutcherson were truly the best part of this flick. Vanessa's buttocks: Central Framed, HD , 3D go watch it now (during the escape from Nemo's burial room)."
7785,"It really does seem as if the film is just building up to each of these scenes and it's fair to say that they're quite memorable. It's well performed, directed with few flaws and the cinematography hits the spot perfectly, but the trouble is, in terms of ratings, that it isn't easy to sell. First Matthew McConaughey, if he's starting to get type - cast so what, he is absolutely wonderful in this role. The performances from the entire cast are terrific with both McConaughey and Kidman doing wonders with their swamp trash characters. Ward brings with him a colleague, Yardley Acheman (David Oyewolo), a black journalist from London."
7656,"It succeeds in doing so on the shoulders of Amanda Seyfried. This movie was well paced and well acted by Seyfried. Dhalia has a great eye, because the scenery in this film was simply breathtaking. The movie and Amanda do a very good job of making you question everything. She is slick in her conversations and smooth in her charms to converse with people and get whatever puzzle pieces they have to offer."
7938,"The locations in both Sydney and abroad have been beautifully shot. There are several poignant moments which are down to great performances by all concerned. The film is also strengthened by three powerful performances. And the opening montage of shots in and around Phnom Penh perfectly captures the pure joy that foreigners can often feel as they experience this wondrous place. Despite its modesty, the power of this thriller comes from the naturalistic performances and the gradual layers of the story that are revealed."
7658,"So don't expect anything other than some wild, over-the-top, epic party experience of the century and you should be OK. Interesting to see what happens through out the movie, it is very intense so you will be blown away at a lot of scenes. It does have its moments, but the best bits tended to be in the trailer. They need plot twists and turns surprises and thrills. It will leave you gritting your teeth and covering your eyes due to it's absurd stunts and the cringe - worthy events in it."
7787,"The costumes are pitch - perfect, the music flows adequately to the events, and the ongoing transition in the atmosphere intensifies the reception of the whole. This was a magnificent film, with stunning performances by the star cast and the supporting roles. A Royal Affair possesses a great energy, which shows its true strength in all the performances. Mads Mikkelsen gives a nuanced performance â€“' quiet intensity' in fact, and Alicia Vikander is equally intense. A Royal Affair is Oscar level material in many respects."
7940,"This is one of the best things that the movies have offered this year yet. The insights are important, and often counterintuitive, and sometimes startling. While the multiple perspectives are intriguing, they become ponderous and repetitive after a while. It's amazing to watch one story, told from different perspectives, yielding different results and emotions. While documentaries often take a very serious, somber, and issue - driven approach, Polley's film proves that real life can be just as magnetic without an epiphany of theatrics or cheap camera tricks."
7659,The main thing is that this movie is wonderful despite the differences. The only positive is that it will probably exit their brains almost as soon as it is over. It's easy to say that Danny DeVito is perfect as the Lorax and Ed Helms is a bit charming as the Once - ler. The characters speak in the kinds of smart - alecky phrases that every animated feature these days seems to incorporate. There will always be discrepancies between book and movie.
7695,"It's about the same style as Sacha Baron Cohen's previous movies, but it's done much better. This movie was absolutely dirty, offensive, hilarious, racist, and crazy over-the-top moments. Like Sellers, Cohen is fearless in his characterizations and, again, like Sellers, there will be those who will take offense in this. It has the same LOL - quality as it did in Borat, but there are scenes where the comedy is so crude that it is almost uncomfortable watching / listening to it. Put your "" Victorian "" influences aside for a night and have a good laugh."
7753,"Their values are money, ostentation, self - aggrandizement, acquisition and mindless hedonism. David and Jackie married in 2000, would over the next nine years have eight children (including an adopted niece), and in 2006 oversaw the start of the construction of their 90 , 000 square - foot Orlando dream home. At the beginning of this disturbing documentary, David Siegel owns Westgate Resorts, one of the world's largest timeshare companies. She is a former model, extremely well endowed physically, and Mrs. America married to a timeshare conglomerate mogul (Westgate Resorts) who built his company into the largest timeshare resort company in the world. Rather than going the been - there - done - that route of a rags to riches story, director Lauren Greenfield accidentally (yet exquisitely) delivers a riches to rags tale with the intimate glimpse into the wealthy lives of David and Jackie Siegel."
7788,"Marley lays bare the heart and soul of the dreadlocked Rhasta in some style. A bit O. T. T, sure, but the comparisons are there (sort of): an immortal advocate of peace and altruism; a liberal; a national treasure. "" Marley "" reveals a variety of live performances, showing Bob Marley at his best and a typically beautiful soundtrack, which mingles with every scene. Rita Marley, his first and last love tells the story of how she stayed with Bob, despite his sexual antics. A story of ambition and tragedy, relating to the shooting of Bob Marley and certain members of The Wailers."
7682,"The stakes are raised, however, when Poe's own fiancÃ©, Emily (Alice Eve) is kidnapped. The Raven does look good, and there are many appealing shots of fog - shrouded streets and dark forests. A merging of the life of Edgar Allan Poe, his poetry, the crimes of his stories and a woven, fictional tale of all of the above is "" The Raven "". With that said however, as serial killer movies go, "" The Raven "" is definitely a' cut' above the average. Don't listen to the negative reviews, this movie is a must - see."
8431,"It's not a complete documentary but it portrays with great accuracy and effect the reality of the early days of one of the nation's worst tragedies. This sounds obvious, but the alternative (leftist) version sustains that the takeover by the military was planned in Washington and included an invasion of Brazil by U. S. Marines. The operation was designed to create vis - Ã  - vis the Latin American audience a preventive policy against hard - line America, to incite demonstrations of intense anti- American sentiments and to label the CIA as a notorious perpetrator of undemocratic intrigue "". Yes, it's clearly established here that Lincoln Gordon, U. S. ambassador in Brazil, was the main figure behind the coup by feeding Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson about the politics behind president JoÃ£o Goulart's basic reforms that gave more power and rights to the common people and demanded more from the nation's rich and big foreign business folks who were unfair with their deals, usually avoiding to pay what's owed to the country."
7789,"It is near - perfect and a step in the right direction for horror movies. The performances are believable and the story is intriguing and always moving. So expectations are placed on the film simply by virtue of the fact it's even being shown. It doesn't offer heaps in terms of originality, but it's a stylistically stunning film and takes steps in the right in direction very gracefully. The shocking imagery and twisted murders with certainly stick with you."
7663,"Tom Hardy and Chris Pine are both charming leads (Pine needs to stop doing that chewing with his mouth open thing) Reese Witherspoon is possibly a little old for this kind of role - or at least this kind of role with Hardy and Pine - but she plays the role well enough. If you wanted to make a movie that was successful at the box office, you could plug the story lines of the top 25 movies for the last 10 years into a computer and have it generate a plot. The actors, at least Tom, was way above the silliness, and you can tell he wasn't enjoying this movie as much as his more serious roles. First, no adult with a few functioning neurons will find the plot compelling. When they first meet, Hardy's character relies more on his honesty and genuine kindness to win over Lauren, yet Pine basically tricks her into liking him after her rejection."
7790,"Kevin James, David Spade, Jon Lovitz, Fran Drescher and especially Steve Buscemi give solid support. While a vast majority of the film is fast - paced with no real dull spots, some parts of the film did feel rushed. The visual animations in the movie are stunning with each scene being carefully visualised and is truly a treat for the eye. On the other point of view, the animation is excellent, the backgrounds are both beautiful and Gothic and that is the same with the colours. This is a really funny movie with a simple predictable story line and tons of characters that you will love."
7681,"There was something so special about these guys who went through anything just to make people smile and you could tell that they loved doing so. 25 years later, the trio is still living there and attempting to help out, and taking care of the kids as well. The mannerisms are flawless, sound effects are on point, even the' special effects' are done in a way that looks like the originals. That is all presented here, perhaps even more often than in the original short films of the '30s & '40s. Even the side characters were really funny like SofÃ­a Vergara, Jane Lynch and Stephen Collins."
7664,"This was SUCH a pleasant surprise. The gem is not without a few rough edges--but the core brilliance is unmistakable and undeniable. The effects on display are as dazzling as Dejah's blue eyes. This is a film that bears watching more than once, and is complex and nuanced enough that subsequent viewings will no doubt reveal new treasures and clarify the minor rough edges--yet it is also compelling and moving on an immersive first viewing in the theater. It pretty much sparked an influence on the sci - fi, action, adventure genre films that most audiences came to know decades later."
7791,"On a light, flippant note, the breakthrough star of the film is the continuity "" errors "" of Keanu's hair and beard, much giggled about in Press interviews! It isn't too technical for novices, but wasn't so basic as to feel dumbed down (the simplicity of the' how a camera works' visual aid graphics were very brief and explanations of abbreviations were only explained once) and you got to see various methods and techniques of film - making - a real behind the scenes. Christopher Kenneally's Direction is flawless, artistic and tight and his writing is succinct, understandable and unbiased. The film does a credible job presenting both sides with a slight edge to a future of all digital and a pessimistic take on film as an eventual curiosity. Some feel this is the end of true film while others feel this is the birth of unlimited creativity, either way this film evokes an emotional response both on the screen and from the viewer which is what film is all about."
7668,"She's constantly before the public and has made millions. But she's good at projecting precisely the right emotional nuances. Ed Harris fills McCain's shoes with a respectful performance with dignity. All the actors are great, but Moore is absolutely stunning in the dramatic scenes. HBO ought to be congratulated for coming up now and again with these perceptive and nicely executed examinations of current events and recent personalities."
7669,"Any successful comedy needs real stakes. 21 Jump Street is undeniably fun and it's probably one of the best comedies of the year. The result is a smart, exciting and often hilarious action - comedy with real stakes and a surprising amount of heart. As far as comedies go, this is a pretty good way to start off 2012 21 Jump Street features some of the most awkwardly humorous camera shot transitions, scene changes and music integration."
7671,"Besson's films seem to have that unique polish and style that places them in a class between A and B movies. But Lockout never did take itself for anything but silly entertainment and, as a result, it works. There's lots of humour (especially in the first scenes - it's like Pearce is doing a Philip Marlowe impression) and the action is non-stop. The gadgets provide some creativity to a number of the sequences and the script manages to inject some unpredictability into a story that could not have a more obvious trajectory. His wisecracks and mindless violence keep your attention."
7793,"Affleck's directing was solid, and the suspense will keep you entertained right through to the last seconds. Yes, it's based on a true story - the movie does it's best to allude that it sticks to technical accuracy. A reasonably competent movies from a technical point of view, but in other respects very misleading. It was Ken Taylor and the Canadians who really pulled' the Canadian Caper' off so successfully. Since the movie premiered, Ben Affleck has added emphasis on the movie postscripts since then that gives kudos to the Canadians' role."
7672,"For those of you who enjoy comedy on many different levels, this one is a must. The lampooning of stereo - types and clichÃ©s were abundant and satisfyingly fresh. After the masterpiece that was "" Anchorman "" he did seem to make a few movies where he played that guy over and over. By the way, be sure to watch the making of featurette on the DVD--it makes the movie a lot more interesting to watch. Casa de mi Padre is meant to poke fun at Mexican telenovelas, and it pretty much succeeded."
7675,"The victory call at the end may be a tad overdone, but the climax alone is worth the price of admission and surprisingly impressive even in post - converted 3D. It's so intricate and complex to stop Cronos escaping! The story is so rubbishy and the dialog so terrible that it's gone light years away from the right direction. This is, and perhaps has always been, about watching Gods, demi - gods and monsters go at each other with sound and fury - and thankfully, this sequel easily betters its predecessor on this regard alone. The film is a sequel to "" Clash of the Titans "", a bad film which actually moved well, had some self - depreciation about it, thanks to European action director Louis Leterrier."
7676,"and the best of the Python movies. In all categories of movie - making from script to screen, this is a triumph. With movies like this directors and other talent pave their way to Hollywood. The style can best be described as toned down and with natural colors that work very well for this film. It was camp, funny and the space battles were epic and the story was enjoyable."
7679,"It blends a few genres together, the two main ones being horror and comedy and it works perfectly. This is a very clever script, with laughs, gore and surprises at every corner. It works on so many levels and is so much fun; the way the conventions of the' Horror' genre are turned upside down, while at the same time the story transcends the mere spoof and satire and becomes something new, entirely original â€“ just: Wow! They take the clichÃ©d aspects of every horror film and put it in here, to brilliant use. It is a funny - scary movie with great visuals and even better dialogues and one - liners, and its pace and twists (even the predictable ones) will not let you get bored even for a minute."
7677,"All in all, it's a well - written, well - rounded film with some good plot twists. Best of all, the film is hilarious, with plenty of laugh out loud moments. Oz, Kevin, Finch, Jim, and of course the man who comes with most of the laughs Stifler are all back. If anything, the film is highly nostalgic. Writers Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg stick to the same formula which made the others so successful, and it worked."
8182,"The viewer really needs to pay attention to the details in order to understand everything that is going on, which creates a thought - provoking experience. As psycho - killer movies go "" Lesson of the Evil "" is up there with the best of them. There's also a nice self - depreciating streak of humour running through the picture, not to mention several great recordings of' Mack the Knife'. Miike's genius is to treat everything so matter - of - factly the film is almost banal to begin with before letting rip. The pacing script does do a good job of slowly revealing the anti-hero's personality - which is oddly charismatic."
7947,"Both movies are about passion, beauty and sadness. This is definitely one of the best movies of the year and it is a shame that it is only up for Best foreign film. Somehow their heroic odyssey into the deepest regions of pain is neither pessimistic nor depressing, and their story communicates profound insights about the need for love, forgiveness and understanding in extreme circumstances. Broken Circle is not as' heavy' as Incendies and even has several smile - worthy moments to balance out the intensity. ' The Broken Circle Breakdown' is about the young couple Didier and Elize."
7948,"The comedic timing is flawless, as is Gerwig's deadpan expression. Mr. Baumbach's visual style and direction is a worthy throwback to the French New Wave era. Baumbach takes those incredibly realistic and often uncomfortable moments, shapes them into black - and - white vignettes that are both immediate and personal, and then precisely combines those vignettes into this delicate and funny film. Baumbach indeed is a virtuoso when it comes to highlighting Frances' myopia through visual (non-dialogue) scenes. Baumbach brilliantly captures this through a black and white lens, and allows his actors the freedom to get immersed in their characters with little restrictions in place."
7794,"Christopher Walken is the best he's been in years. But it's Walken who has one of his best roles in ages. This one definitely has more appeal (more stars, set in Los Angeles, etc.), but both films have similar sensibilities. Beyond that layer, the film offers a potent combination of semi-gratuitous violence, loony antics and some stirring poignancy. The four main players, however, give some of the best turns of their careers."
7795,"Arguably the best performances, though, are given by Jenkins and Magaro. From the opening sequence to the credits the film is thoroughly entertaining, and intelligent. Elizabeth Olsen was enthusiastic and energetic, just as Zibby should have been portrayed. Even Zac Efron, making a humorous cameo appearance, helps liven things up a bit. Aging may bring wisdom, (well, at least to some) but it also brings a whole new array of problems; problems that cannot be understood by those outside of a highly specific age range."
7796,"Jarecki makes some of the most important and enlightening documentaries of today. It has enlightening and entertaining moments, but there are many flaws in the storytelling. Against this background, Eugene Jarecki has written, produced and directed this striking documentary examining the impact of the war on drugs in America. In 40 years, of America's' war on drugs', more than 45 million arrests have been made. It's a fair and balanced look at how it subsidizes thousands of jobs and locks up millions of innocent people."
7797,"Fast - forward a decade â€“ along with the noted Paradise Lost documentaries, things well To see that such an incredible human being come back so strong after everything he had endured. It is a film of extraordinary power that has the ability to stir a range of emotions from frustration, anger, depression, to even joy. That is an incredible number of documentaries on the same case, and is probably a cinematic and judicial record of some kind. Over the following 15 years, doubt over the convictions grows, and fanned by several celebrities taking up the cause (Eddie Vedder, Jonny Depp among them), eventually force the Arkansas state to re-look at the case."
7744,"The original was about mind - bogglingly oppressive corporate greed and as a result you felt a wide range of strong emotions! Arnie has a much stronger screen presence than Farrell and it is much more ambitious and has more heart than this sleeker, newer one. Farrell can act and is definitely a strong action lead and it shows here, as per the beautiful ladies Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel who both show off brawn over beauty here. If you like a little meat on your plot's backbone, you may want to lower your expectations a little bit before seeing this one. Enticed by the fantasy inducing company called Rekall where one can live out one's fantasy for a fee, Douglas soon discovers he got more than he bargained for."
7716,"Rosie has a very positive attitude and has confidence that because she is young she will definitely have many more chances at pregnancy. It is an interesting comedy for expecting mothers. Other than that, this is all pure middle - class Hollywood, pretty slick, light - hearted but with enough sweet - and - sour moments to make it feel like it's actually about something. Even in the advanced stages of her pregnancy, Skyler remains gorgeous and unburdened with physical ailments such as a weak bladder, swollen ankles, and an aching back. This film is about several couples who are expecting babies."
7800,"Decidedly so, the interviews shine a new light on the past events presented in the archival footage, and their coming together combines for a valuable film experience. Their courage and strength will be imprinted on others forever. Ultimately, her contributions were more valuable than any other member. What's so great about this movie is that it uses video footage from throughout the decades to tell its story. Still, HOW TO SURVIVE A PLAGUE is a pretty haunting and dramatic little picture that will certainly be a staple of its subject for years to come."
7801,"And it is for this reason that "" 56Up "" is one of the most poignant and insightful entries in the series (and one imagines it will only get more poignant and insightful with each successive edition). Wasn't it a miracle that none of the died in 49 years? ( The stunning contrast between the grainy black - and - white imagery of the first film and the hi - def clarity of the current interviews underlines the extraordinary length of time the series has already covered). Here, they had their share of ups and downs, separations, health issues, deaths but they always managed to look at the bright side of life. It is refreshing, though, to see so many of them aging gracefully, being happy in their advancing ages, avoiding dwelling on what might have been if they had made different choices."
7802,"Tyler Perry's acting shines in a few scenes. There are a lot of problems with Alex Cross. Skeptics may think Tyler Perry was a bad choice to fill in a young Morgan Freeman's shoes but he was absolutely fine in the role. For example, when Cross and his partner (Edward Burns) walk into the first handful of murders committed by Matthew Fox, Burns guesses that this must have been the work of multiple guys. The audience is just supposed to believe he's smart because other characters say so."
7803,"Also deserving of praise, and possibly Oscars is the large scale visual effects that cover hundreds of years and look so believable. Having so many dimensions to explore with all of their characters must have been acting nirvana for this lot. From top to bottom, everyone displays amazing performances. The best performances are given, however, by Doona Bae and Jim Broadbent. The truth is that Cloud Atlas is profound in its reach, its visual and acoustic impact, its mesmerizing flow and its completely ground - breaking storytelling, and movie goers will see it and feel it in their guts."
7729,"The characters are strong, as is the message. It's packed with effects, graphics, music, quality actors and is a very accomplished piece of work. Insightful is a word which best describes this film. Overall, a great watch with some excellent action shots and twists and turns throughout. It's a story about people who have absolutely no doubt that their ends justify the means."
7961,"Its the third film Ryan Kwantan has made in Australia for three years now (after Red Hill and Griff The Invisible). Not Suitable For Children, a delightful Australian film, is miles away from the local comedies produced in the early noughties. It certainly won't tax the viewer's little grey cells (so that'll be the audience and the scriptwriter, then), but it's an amusing and entertaining film. Covering some truths of conceiving and cancer, this film doesn't stray too far from the beaten track. The director made smart, funny, caring, gutsy, real and tender choices which hit their mark, every time."
7714,"The demonstrations of her skills are absolutely breathtaking. The movie starts out great: funny characters, great scenery, Scottish accents, and a promising protagonist. The magic feels out of place, lots of wasted scenes, and the whole bear thing was just plain annoying after a while. Philosophers through the ages have distinguished the two based on choice. Another immensely impressive aspect is its supremely dazzling animation aesthetics, the resplendent beauty of the Scottish countryside sometimes stealing scenes from its characters."
7806,"This was not a sine qua non pre-condition for the part, but it was certainly an asset. He wrote the script with the renowned veteran screen writer Jean - Claude Carrierre. One of those very rare masterpieces that come as sheer satisfactions after years of wait! Exquisitely shot: colours, set ups, scenes - everything was admirable. That saves the virtuous heroine (Golshifteh Farahani)."
7807,It's a smart film in it's comedic moments. Salma Hayek provided both eye candy and a lot of substance. Good Points: Perfect casting; all the characters were very believable and enjoyable to watch. This movie works and it will make anyone laugh! Kevin James is perfect in the lead and his common man qualities play extremely well here.
7808,"Destined to become a classic, with excellent performances from all. Plenty of laughs and overall highly entertaining. The cast is superb, particularly Collette, Gibney and newcomer Lily Sullivan as the eldest daughter. The film had memorable characters, quirky situations, hilarious scenes, and some truly fantastic acting from all the cast. Some reviewers have labeled the plot as complicated and bumpy - and it is - sort of like real life."
7966,"To "" What Maisie Knew, "" for example, than to "" The Great Gatsby . "" Directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel have created a movie that feels like life, the vulnerability, the abruptness, the comedy, the joy. WHAT MAISIE KNEW isn't going to appeal to a mass audience but it's certainly a terrific little gem from directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel. Both Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd and Joanna Vanderham are also great as these much more sympathetic adults. What Maisie Knew (2012), directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel, is an extraordinary movie about an extraordinary young girl."
7967,"But in this instance it's a fairly relevant one as in many ways this is another example of the body horror sub-genre. Making him her test subject for new procedures, keeping him alive and aware the whole time. Ruby, Beatrice and the others are all portrayed as good people on the inside, but different on the out. Oscar worthy central performance which makes it the best Horror acting for ages. The 2012 film "" American Mary "" features Katherine Isabelle, the breakout star of 2001's "" Ginger Snaps "", as a Med student who finds herself performing body mod surgeries that she finds out is quite good at."
7809,"There is a great cast with Pitt, Jenkins and James Gandolfini being the biggest draws. Everyone is given beautiful little soliloquies. Some of the extended dialog scenes are pretty good but not quite excellent. The simplicity of this film is what makes it so good, no super action scenes, or litres of blood or music for that matter. When bullets fly in this film - you feel it, because you feel for the characters, which is why having Cogan as its opaque center is so blisteringly effective."
7810,"Suffice to say, Bourdin is an intimidatingly convincing, intelligent and charismatic figure. Well polished, well executed and well edited, there are few documentaries that can suck you into them and actually wonder what is next. But, as soon as the credits roll, you'll be talking about this exceptional movie for years to come. The film explores the unravelling of this story through interviews and very well realised reconstructions of the events. Although the film does underwhelm in the end slightly, that can't be helped for it's a documentary, the best aspect is the slick photography in both the interviews and re-enactments making it look incredibly cinematic."
7811,"It provides a great service to everyone caught in such extreme circumstances and deserves success. Helen Hunt is flawless, as always, and pretty comfortably gets into the shoes of a sex surrogate. These two performances are some of the best (so far) this year. Mark O'Brien's story is intriguing, inspiring and quite moving. The compassion she brings to the role is certainly something special and the chemistry between the two hits on all the right marks."
7812,There has been a lot of praise given for Jack Reynor's performance. His characters always feel complex and real. On a positive note there are some standout performances at times affecting and unsettling. It featured glowing reviews by Irish critics announcing it to be the most important Irish film of the decade. Abrahamson is great at observing and capturing the complexities of late teen - age life with subtlety and a fresh eye.
7813,"John C. Reily gives Ralph an acceptably nice personality. And the voice performances were great. By its grand scale and references, the experience is gloriously extraordinary. Sarah Silverman makes Vanellope adorable enough. Its visual design is brilliant and its action pieces pretty amazing."
7814,"He understands these tough as nails people who wear their emotions on their sleeves. allows each character in this dramedy to become whole and interesting without becoming marginalized. Everything he does is to make himself look desirable to her. In fact, this is so far the best of the romantic comedies in recent memory. Silver Linings Playbook is without a doubt Cooper's best work thus far in his career."
7973,"It's basically a pure celebration of Allen's work and it does well to show the sheer volume of quality he has produced over the years. The wealth of well - chosen clips really is very good, while the selection of talking heads add good value. As all movie fans will know, Allen is responsible for some of the greatest movies of the modern era. Of his New York movies he says the future lasting value they will have is providing interesting scenes around the city. Annie Hall is constantly cited as a great Hollywood classic, as are other accomplishments like Hannah And Her Sisters and Manhattan."
7974,"But oh what sweet, sweet DePalmaesque inanity this is! It works as a - not very thrilling - thriller, and Noomi Rapace does a good performance. Basically, "" Passion "" has a hint of what usually made DePalma's movies good. The plot twists are visible with your eyes closed and nothing will be a surprise. It is simply amazing how fast a crap script writer can get fatuous nauseating inane notions across in such a short time; something that should surely be speculated upon in film schools during the first semester."
7815,"John Goodman plays an interesting character and provides some laughs. The direction here is clean, crisp, and efficient as ever, producing a simple, but powerful script by John Gatins, chock - full of par - none supporting roles by the likes of John Goodman, Don Cheadle, and Bruce Greenwood. It is easy to appreciate the high praise for one of Denzel's finest performances, the wonderful cast, and the quality of the narrative and storyline over the course of most of the film. Even though Goodman is only in the film for a short amount of time, he delivers some of the best scenes in the movie. This may seem like a hero story since Washington was successful in saving the lives of the majority of the passengers."
7816,"A lot has been said about its theatrics and casting, visual effects and costumes. On the other hand, Jude Law was perfect as Karenin, as were Domnhall Gleeson as Levin and Olivia Williams as Countess Vronskaya. This is why the drama had to be moved from the formal level to individual qualities of the people involved. Classical waltz transformed into anything but, with peculiar hand movements that one critic described as "" beguiling "" but which looked suspiciously like mutual slapping of pesky insects and afforded a great deal more of physical intimacy in public than what was socially acceptable. Add to this aristocrats dressed like peasants (Karening in the ice - skating scene), rich landowner styled like a monk (Levin's hair throughout the film) then same landowner donned in a top hat not worn by the people from his "" soslovie "" (social stratum), Betsy and her jaundice coloured dress, Karenina at the theatre in what looks like a wedding dress and ermine stole, Karenin wearing his wedding band on the left hand (instead of the customary right in Russia), Karenina wearing multiple rings (Chanel - style, naturally) on both hands, - was someone confused as to the custom and decided to tick both boxes, just in case?"
7817,"Suraj Sharma was brilliant as Pi. Suraj Sharma as the young Pi was charming, funny, and incredibly engaging, while Irrfan Khan as the older Pi was fantastically genuine and warm. The guy is awesome handling some tough intense scenes in the movie. The Acting is incredibly believable, and the ending ties it all together. Suraj Sharma debuts as pi with utter sincerity while Irfan Khan (as adult pi) and Tabu (as mother) do justice to their parts."
8441,""" The Harvest "" is a great low - budget thriller with top - notch performances, highlighting Samantha Morton. The concept of the movie is really good and not a clichÃ©. This is an engrossing, quite disturbing production, with terrific acting, especially from the juveniles. The two friends continue to see each other even at the warnings of both families. It's not convenient to know too much about The Harvest before watching it, in order to preserve its ingenious surprises."
7849,"It's well paced and has a great feel to it from the get - go, mostly in part to wonderful narration from Holt, and smooth direction from Levine. The directing, writing, and pretty much everything in the film was well done. Also, bonies, for some reason, move fast despite being in a more advanced stage of zombification. The two leads had great chemistry and were believable and well cast. Set in a post apocalypse era, Warm Bodies is more about open mindedness, the ability to accept that others can change."
7873,"You can foresee almost all of the events that will play out in the last 20 minutes and while it's enjoyable enough, it's nothing you haven't seen before. The cast is magnificent, with names such as Sean Penn, Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, Robert Patrick, Giovanni Ribisi among many others and the art direction and costumes is also excellent. It has some fun action sequences with some strong performances, especially from the always reliable Ryan Gosling who continues to reinvent himself in every movie. A tremendous cast and glamorous production design is wasted hosting loosely connected action scenes, with little substance to support them. Robert Patrick plays to perfection a veteran, incorruptible police who takes under his experience and protection to Michael PeÃ±a."
7877,"WB / DC's Direct - to - DVD Animated Film "" BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS "" is an Adaptation of Frank Miller's comic published in 1986. It can be said that Dark Knight Returns, when both parts are viewed as one whole movie, is a true animated epic worthy of some awards. Animation is of the highest quality, rivaling that of big budget anime movies. While face - offs with Harvey Dent & the Mutant Leader in Part 1 was great, battles with the Joker & Superman in Part 2 takes animation movies to a whole new level. Whether you are a fan of the comics or the main films or not this is worth a watch and you may be surprised."
7880,"This production uses excellent sets, props, and costumes. The film's first fifteen minutes are probably the most straightforward, most interesting, and most disturbing aspect of the whole thing, and it serves as an important fulcrum point. Watching this film is a strangely mesmerizing, lucid, and smooth experience, given the exquisite imagery, nuanced performances, and quality music score. He clearly has a love of the material and his choice of Amy Seimetz really makes the film work. The movie draws stark parallels between such images, to unearth some rich thematic territory."
7885,"Also, the hilarious basketball sketch where they comment on the fact that basketball players are mostly black! In the first short, how funny is it to see Kate Winslet and Hugh Jackman go on a date, with everyone being oblivious to the large scrotum attached to his neck except for Winslet? If you are looking for an art film, or a "" Licoln "" or a light sweet romantic comedy or any spiritually stimulating film like that to engage in some sort of intellectual conversation over coffee after seeing this, the reviews here should give you a clue."
7887,"Yes, the gore factor was really high, but everything appeared to be done with tongue strictly in cheek. Gemma Arterton is certainly very sexy as Gretel. To have the protagonists be siblings was a refreshing twist. That doesn't mean however that this reimagination is predictable; instead, Wirkola keeps you riveted with a surprisingly effective blend of horror and hilarity often within the very same scene. Savvy viewers will be able to spot the connection once the clues are laid, so don't expect a revelatory surprise at the end."
7893,"The scenes they share are the most arresting in this film. But within the conventions of conventional movies, he usually makes really watchable, polished, and visually beautiful movies. It is a complex of characters, their motives, and the consequences of their actions, and, despite taking a while to get started, it is truly a spectacular, thrilling, and intricate journey that should not be missed. Law shows this frustration with expert skill, and gives one of the best performances of his recent career. Nonetheless, a fine set of performances all around, but they take a back seat to the intoxicating narrative."
7894,"A strong contender for the Razzies, and for those unfamiliar, they acknowledge and award the worst movie of the year. The film suffers from the classic complaint that the funniest moments were in the trailer, and even then it's nothing special. Director Seth Gordon's previous feature, "" Horrible Bosses "" (2012), wasn't anything special as a comedy despite its potential, but it contained a few clever moments to make it worthwhile. Good person feels unloved, steals someone else's material goods to feel appreciated, throws party, is told no one cares and voila"
7896,"BEAUTIFUL CREATURES captures the whole Southern Gothic tradition quite well. Regardless, BEAUTIFUL CREATURES is vividly filmed with good performances by Alice Englert, Alden Ehrenreich, Emmy Rossum, Rachel Brosnahan, and just about everyone else. One way or another, the relationships in this film are very real. Beautiful Creatures has a big Romeo and Juliet thing going on, but at the same time, there's mysteries, prophesies, hypocrisy, Southern politics, Civil War history, religion, death, evil forces, and all sorts of madness making for quite an interesting story (with some very witty and sarcastic dialogue to put a cherry on top). Emmy Rossum as the wicked siren, Ridley, was fabulous, and Thomas Mann was hilarious as Link."
7897,"But like all Die Hard movies, there has to be at least one sensational action sequence, and that is at the film's beginning. If anything, the music is better than the movie. He is a reluctant hero in the first four films, he can get seriously wounded, as he is up against worthy adversaries that are cool, calculative and almost one step ahead of him. Six years after successfully restarting the most important character of his entire movie - making career, Willis has to watch it all crash and burn to the ground with this loud, dumb and plain boring fifth chapter, the erroneously - titled' A Good Day to Live Hard'. Imagine what a better movie this could've been with those cut scenes added back in."
7901,"As a three part series, the Before movies are practically perfect. The film is an absolute marvel, showcasing the very best dialogue and capturing the sheer essence of acting brilliance from stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. SLACKERS was only 22 years ago, and Linklater has matured into one of the most original filmic storytellers in the history of the medium. As Jesse this time around, Hawke uses every ounce of magnetism, charisma, and acting ability to bring himself to the levels of legendary actors like Daniel Day - Lewis and Marlon Brando. Content-wise, the conversations in this latest' Before' film are of much lower quality."
7903,"It is also notable that there are virtually no females in either the giants' or human's realm. The 3D is fairly unspectacular, although there are great sequences, such as the collapse of the vine which causes catastrophic damage below. Unlike many of Hollywood's reimaginings of fairy tales, this film is actually decent. In the kingdom of Cloister, in Albion, there is a legend about giants that came from the realm of Gantua, between Earth and Heaven, using a large beam stalk and were defeated by King Eric that was wearing a magic crown. Instead, one can actually enjoy this on almost all levels."
7905,"The action scenes are acceptable enough to call awesome at least. The fight between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow remains to be the only action that excites and one part of the climax has a nutty scene with The Rock riding huge vehicles and shooting like a badass. Elodie Yung, Ray Park and Adrianne Palicki are just okay. It's amazing how many good movies produced this year have been relegated to sub-par status, while others that shouldn't be given a glance are given zenith status as great pieces of work, art, and other such pop - cultural sub - standard excrescences achieve more than their worth in fool's gold. The teens are surely going to love this one!"
7906,"From the opening scene of fragmented shots with computer generated transitions that occur throughout the movie, his mark is clearly laid on the film. Mia Wasikowska has always been lovely and talented. An exciting, twisted story, very powerful scenes, even scenes that many people won't be able to tolerate. The acting of movie's three lead characters viz. Mia Wasikowska, Nicole Kidman, and Matthew Goode is quite brilliant and in that order. Stoker, the first film made stateside by CWP, defiantly doesn't disappoint."
7907,"From great visuals to imaginative set pieces, this film has everything. It can Work Very Well in Limited Quantities but when that's All there is, that's All there is. It slots in perfectly as the precursor to the Wizard of Oz. It was an enjoyable romp through a gorgeous landscape with enough insider references to merit multiple viewings. A very fun and crafty Rachel Weisz takes the role of Evanora and grips the audience with charm and viciousness in all the right doses."
7908,"It is great for all ages. The 3d seems to be on a new level of excellence. It has something for people of all ages to enjoy. As expected from a DreamsWork movie the animation is fantastic. And for the 3D, you know it's great as long as it's from Dreamworks Animation."
7909,"The performances are endearing and well acted. Jim Carrey is the second part of the equation, at his best since years. There are some hysterically funny moments in this movie - and many other laugh out loud moments. One of the funnier comedies of recent years. Steve Carrell plays a good "" diva "" in Burt Wonderstone."
7911,"The Call is good solid entertainment for the first 2 acts. Character, plot, action, and suspense â€” all the ingredients of a good thriller are there, and blended well. The movie works because it has it's ingredients well cooked. So, if you enjoy thrillers, you won't be disappointed with this one! The tension was top notch, the tones were absolutely spot on, the close - ups of the actors and actresses faces showed their true nervousness, stresses and worked effectively."
7912,"a) A plane makes it to D. C. before being intercepted by two raptors, which get shot down and after that only ONE raptor is sent to deal with the threat."
7916,"With the wealth of information on only Spector's case, but the possibilities that could've resulted because of Spector's true enigma and personality as a whole, a whole hour could've been attached on to the ending. During the course of it, the dialog is fast - paced, always engaging, and buoyed greatly by two terrific performers. Almost as entertaining as Specter and Baden is Baden and co-counsel Bruce Cutler, played flawlessly by Jeffrey Tambor. Much of it consists of private conferences between Spector and Baden, as well as between Baden and her cohort attorneys. For those unaware, Phil Spector was a renowned record producer in the sixties and seventies, known for helping The Ronettes, John Lennon, and The Ramones achieve untold heights with their music."
7917,"If you want something that is action - packed and filled with cool sci - fi moments do not see this movie. It is true that the film has some bad dialogue, but with some of the moments that were comical that had be intentional, with some of its moments of cultural clash and the bickering between Wanderer and Melanie. An apocalyptic world about relationships of these good looking couples with fast awesome cars crashing on the road. The exteriors serves a lot of intrigue to its world. Plenty of sophisticated action as well as thought - provoking concepts of love, loyalty, perseverance."
7918,"He was irresistibly charming with that dimpled smile and those sparkling green eyes. As mentioned before, this film has very likable actors and the chemistry fluidly bounces off with each other. Tina and Paul do their best to keep it on tracks. Admission requires no small amount of sympathy for the messy business of growing up and getting ahead â€” Weitz navigates the vagaries of family ambition well. Nat Wolff as Jeremiah is very sweet and has come a long way since his Nickelodion series."
7919,"Its performances, style and tremendous attention to detail is enough make a very balanced film. Lauded with plaudits and success, it would appear he can do no wrong. In fact, as it tends to be a defining quality of all of Boyle's films, this one does not disappoint in its assault on the senses. Seemingly able to satisfy even the sternest of sceptics with a rabid display of flair and flamboyance, he became elevated to a hallowed level of reverence. If you love movies similar to Memento this is definitely something to check out."
7921,"It has a good amount of twists, and real depth. The special effects are very good. The sound effects are excellent as well. Specifically the drones make excellent noises at various stages of the film. Super performance by Tom cruise, Olga Kurylenko, Andrea Riseborough and of course Morgan freeman."
7923,"The period details are attentively done, and the competent casting of the support players is a big plus. And this film succeeds in depicting all three aspects to bring a powerful, heartwarming, humorous film. It's nice to see old Ebbets Field brought back to life. Chadwick Boseman & Nicole Beharie did a magnificent job portraying the grace and courage of the Robinsons. Almost 70 years later his influence is still felt today."
7927,"All of the cast was well chosen, from Dwayne to Shalhoub and especially Wahlberg. Shalhoub can pull off a "" tough guy "" pretty well. This is all put together very well into a fine flick that delivers the laughs. The movie manages to go from serious, to gory, to slapstick all in a matter of minutes, and somehow still manages to work. Minus the giant robots, and that's a good thing in this case."
7928,"It is a very clever and entertaining comedy, with hilarious and dirty dialogues. Browsing carpet samples at Lowes was infinitely more entertaining than this piece of garbage. The plot sets itself up for hilarity, as they all take refuge in James Franco's fortress of a mansion while the world outside them goes up in flames. It's brilliant that they all just play themselves and manage to poke fun at their own lifestyles. For anyone who can truly appreciate a hilarious movie which is made specifically to humor and entertain people, and has no other hidden agenda whatsoever, this is definitely a must watch."
7929,"Robert Downey is as good as ever, Paltrow, Pearce, Cheadle & Co follow not far behind. One of the best scenes from a film ever. Robert Downey's charismatic take on the character was the big reason of the success of the previous movies in the franchise and he still hasn't lost his charm. The big third act finally has been pretty much spoiled by every single trailer they put out but it still manages to deliver in terms of sheer' ZOMG' awesomeness. Aldrich Killian participated in the development of Extremis thereby amassing a group of Extremis - enhanced soldiers under his command."
7930,"Ms. Moore is simply superb here. Ms. Moore's arc is predictable, but the journey remains a lot of fun. She's a national treasure and woman - of - a-certain-age Hollywood still calls. It is one of the greatest personal tragedies in life, and those who experience it are likely to lose confidence in themselves and in the world. This is one of the best indie comedies in years and deserves much more critical acclaim and financial success than it received."
7934,"The story moves along at a good pace, there were no boring parts. There are layers to the characters and story that requires a re-watch to get everything. The scenes were also shot beautifully which is very engaging. As for the actual romance part of the story, yes, it is interesting in its own right, although the ending could have perhaps been a bit different (no spoilers here). Creating gigantic levels of deep meaning concepts, non-ambiguity, establishing marketing mantra by keeping the stereotype strong."
7937,"Cuberbatch's performance is the best thing this time and overshadows everyone else. This kind of formula occasionally produces an awesome movie or two, but those movies are usually fresh and intelligently made in some way that makes them stand out. Paramount Pictures, director JJ Abrams and writers, Orci, Lindelof, and Kurtzman have once again proved that they figure Trekkies will go see anything as long as it's got the name "" Star Trek "" on it. This movie is missing the hallmark epiphany moments Star Trek is famous for. When Cumberbatch is captured, he and Pine briefly become caricatures of Hannibal Lecter and Agent Starling from Silence of the Lambs."
7939,"They are witty, and Vaugh's delivery is great. This movie is more like an e mail you got 4 years ago that was hilarious, and someone sent it to you again. Saw a pre-screening with a friend this film last night. What you get here is a headache inducing, cerebral bombing, diarrhoea of pointless noise masquerading as "" cinema "" which is the aural equivalent of a strobe light for your earholes. The Google campus proved an interesting site in itself."
7942,"The best parts were the Bangkok night scenery. Cinemathography is beautifully worked, use of the red light is perfect, framing also. It was also an amazing movie experience, it's one of those movies that you just give yourself over to. This movie also had very good soundtracks which added another great layer to it. Its twists and turns will almost certainly surprise you, and it will linger on your mind long after the credits roll."
7943,"Nothing about this film appeals, nothing makes it worth seeing. After the gut - busting hilarity of the 2009 original, this comedy franchise has been struck down with a severe case of sequel-itis. Jeong is good in small doses but putting him into so much of this just made his character annoying. It's really amazing to see how this series has fallen after a clever first film but the old saying that sequels usually end up poorly is certainly true. Furthermore, this is by far one of the most aggressive Hangover pictures in terms of what it portrays as comedy."
7944,"The exquisitely staged vehicular mayhem is complemented by a firm sense of camaraderie amongst Toretto's group. Nonetheless, the cast here is consistently entertaining, with the screenplay letting everyone get a chance to shine, even if some of them aren't quite as memorable as others. Best recommended to fans of the series, especially if you've been following the last few movies. But if the coda before the end credits is anything to go by, there's plenty of reason to get excited for next summer's follow - up. The film generally looks good, but many of the action scenes are hectically shot and edited, and it can be hard to tell what's going on in certain scenes."
7945,"The best part of the film is the animation; dazzling, lively, meticulously detailed, and it helps bring everything to life. , iii) the whole valley turning green at the end of "" Princess Mononoke "", and iv) the infinitely graded colors in "" Oz the Great and Powerful "". It even had some good humorous parts, including a pair of mollusks and a three - legged dog. The acting is really superb and all the actors have great chemistry together: Amanda Seyfried, Josh Hutcherson, Christoph Waltz, Colin Farrell, Aziz Ansari, and Jason Sudekis are terrific, while BeyoncÃ© is the best of all. His special protÃ©gÃ© is independent - minded brash Nod (Josh Hutcherson), who disregards structure and rules."
7946,"Berenice Bejo is here at her best. Not to deny the greatness of Farhadi's "" a separation "" but as far as quality goes "" the past "" is a perfect and unrepeatable event in every aspect. Asghar Farhadi outdid himself with this masterpiece, following up on the Oscar - winning' A Separation'. These factors, packed with impeccable performances by the lead cast members, are fortunately very very realistic i. e. not over-dramatic or nonsensical (though a lot of shouting war was shown). A pure drama, which glues you to your seat, with so intense performances, powerful characters so brilliantly played."
7949,"All submit strong performances despite brief appearances in almost cameo roles. The supporting cast members are equally effective as the leads. The two leads create a totally believable relationship between their characters, in all its aspects. This is a first - rate piece of work by Mr Soderbergh and his team (kudos to Ellen Mirojnick's flamboyant costumes and Howard Cummings' outrageous interiors). The story itself is pretty much by the numbers with the kind of shorthand one expects from a TV movie bio; it's the performances that bring this to a certain level of greatness."
7950,"That Will Smith chose Shyamalan, a abysmal film maker for years, is distraughtly. Shymalan's well - made film has some striking imagery, mostly of panoramic vistas, but his ill - conceived screenplay (co-written with Gary Whitta) keeps this exercise in filmmaking rather earthbound. The journey Kitai undertakes is supposed to make him into a man, while allowing his father to win respect for him. Director M. Night Shyamalan, the man who continually keeps falling from grace, one film after the next, is still tumbling further from his talented beginnings, although here the director crashes and burns. Each adventure he undertakes is small in scope - He runs away from a pack of baboons, he fights off some lions, he is briefly poisoned by a parasitic creature."
7951,"Flashy, loud with bells and whistles and big personalities, an exciting premise. All the best parts of this film are well - packaged and sold in the gripping theatrical trailer. You'd expect suspense, twists, intelligent plot misdirection and all sorts of thrilling viewing? The best scenes in this movie easily are the ones with just the two of them on screen because their chemistry and on screen charisma is enough to carry any scene. The street tricks on TV are way more fun and enjoyable."
7952,"Still, Seyfried did well with what she was given. All that being said, the film has its entertaining sequences - mostly thanks to the performances which are great. Directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman started off making documentaries that were both important and compelling. Things start off happy and there are lots of funny moments but soon enough things take a turn for the worse and that is where the true drama ensues. Arguably, a great biopic embraces the complexities of a person's life while using storytelling to organize such intricacies."
7953,"As her boyfriend, however, Carell is on superb form. Then, about twenty minutes in, something sparked and the investment for the first quarter became worthwhile. There's a very natural and wholesome vibe to it, especially in the water park scenes - nothing looks too modern or high - tech; it's just a place where people go to have an old - fashioned good time. The cast is strong and in addition to the lead played by Liam James you have the likes of Steve Carell, Toni Collette and Sam Rockwell. While Steve Carell may be the most popular name on the poster, the movie has a great cast altogether."
7955,"Because if you really really decide, then you can do anything. Michael Shannon as Zod is terrific. Some of the nicest things about this movie is the way they made the fast moving scenes. The movements are what you expect if such kind of people exist in reality. The story is decently paced, and fueled by strong performances by Michael Shannon and Russell Crow (e)."
7956,"The concept of this story has merit, however the execution is well off the mark in all respects. The screenplay by first timer Chris Galletta was also really well developed. It does have that sort of familiar indie vibe to it, but thanks to some great performances the movie stands out above most of them. The three kids give great performances and all seem so natural in their characters; Moises Arias is exceptionally funny as the oddball Biaggio. Those unscripted moments in which the kids simply goof around with one another are the best."
7957,"These are the examples of the back - ups who successfully made the walk. But the filmmakers have culled extraordinary performances, both then and now. Overall this film is fascinating and entertaining, and makes a great companion piece to Standing in the Shadows of Motown (2002) and Muscle Shoals (2013). You may not recognize the names or faces, but you will surely recognize the voices. Another excellent feature of the film comes in the form of interviews from the likes of Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Stevie Wonder, Lou Adler, Chris Botti, and Mick Jagger."
7958,"It's a cold, deadpan film, but there's several fascinating moments of insight and darkly funny commentary that make it interesting. There's several poignant and moving moments between the two characters that cut through the film like a knife and let you into the ultimately empty and sad feelings the two characters have. No doubt it's an important development in society but using these cardboard characterisations creates a pretty boring film. Case in point one of the heist scenes is a continuous shot of the exterior of a house while the characters are running around inside of it for a good four minutes. Their scenes and dialogue are so sharply drawn that it reminds you just how gifted of a writer Coppola is as well."
7959,"Still the same incredibly interesting world with all its colors, fantastic creatures, and quirks. Monsters University is a great film. As well as an adorable new cast of monsters which are equally lovable as the old ones. Monsters University is great fun and it's Pixar best since Up! The new characters that become Mike and Sully's friends, the Oozma Kappa gang, are all adorable and memorable, providing a lot of the film's humour as well as one of its most touching moments towards the end."
7962,"It all blends well with the loopiness of it all. Ron Perlman comes and goes and works his usual incredible moments. The aliens and robots blend very well with all their surroundings. "" Pacific Rim "" is going to be a hit with fanboys all over the planet. ( Hint: Stay a couple of minutes into the end credits for an awesome additional scene )"
7963,"Sylvia Hoeks is just so breathtakingly beautiful. there is no place for useless sequences, everything goes smoothly and natural, the drama is well tempered until the very final peak, the whole is well balanced and wonderful. The movie is breathtaking and captures you from the first seconds. The Best Offer, with its tight screenplay, lush sets, brilliant performance by Geoffrey Rush and beautiful score by Ennio Morricone, also exemplifies the sophisticated expertise filmmaking. Just go watch one of the best offers 2013 cinema has in store so far."
7964,"If anything, these scenarios bring out the best of all of them. But Mr. Pitt delivers a performance that is quite pleasing. As far as zombie movies go this one is pretty great. It's also worth noting that it has several humorous scenes too. The zombie attacks are large - scale, grand, and extremely exciting, save for the climax which ends up as a small - scale sequence, but is equally satisfying."
7965,"Directing, photography, music, and performances are all superb. The set and production designers truly did a great job with the locations. Using the very best Weta Workshop has to offer. And then, you get to see glimpses of the wonderful Elysium, a visual tour - de-force that ends up being shamefully underused in the film. The first moments Max is shown after being exposed to radiation, the film jumps into a nerve - racking tone, and it is very effective, as it is blended with several dramatic elements that range from innovative to pretty common."
7968,"Toss in great gags and action packed and imaginative excitement. As it puts in a sense more of a focus on Gru as a father and the Minions become part of a sinister plot. The animation is so colorful and delightful, so pleasing to the eye in its adorableness. The main character Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) is likable and funny. The top - notch vocal talents of Steve Carrell, Steve Coogan, Kristen Wiig, Benjamin Bratt and even Russell Brand are a further advantage."
7969,"There are quite a few unexpected twists and turns along the way, and the wonderful supporting cast (James Woods, Richard Jenkins and Jason Clarke, to name a few) keep even the most clichÃ©d characters fun and interesting. Channing Tatum does his best Bruce Willis impression while Jamie Foxx turns in the worst performance of his career. This movie is packed with excitement, action, and CGI effects - almost start to finish. The world has seen millions of movies where USA comes under attack. Channing Tatum, James Woods, Maggie Gyllenhaal and little Joey King did really good work!"
7970,"The lads have clearly come a long way over the years. Wright once again shows that he's at the top of his game, the action scenes are wonderfully executed and the effects are superb. The supporting cast are excellent including (surprisingly well cast) Rosamund Pike, Martin Freeman to name a few and a surprise cameo by an ex-Bond. The robot designs are eerily simple, the pace and physical slapstick are howlingly perfect, while the grim, sepia lighting is perfectly atmospheric for the intensifying sci - fi peril and slurring melodrama unfolding. Wright's characteristic swish - pans and dynamic sound effects, paired with some of the most intricately crunchy fight choreography seen in ages make The World's End thrilling in the most visceral sense."
7971,""" The Heat "" is the funniest movie of the year. Witty, hilarious dialogue, silly scenes and a lot of fun. It's the funniest thing that you'll see all year Melissa Mcarthy was the funniest You'll love this movie! There were continual laughs throughout due to the witty lines and expert delivery, with some real high points of absolute hilarity. There was so much laughter at certain scenes it was hard to hear the dialogue, so you know people are having a fun & happy night out!"
7972,"The scenery is awesome and the action scenes are beautifully photographed or green screened, CGI'd or real. If you take it for what it is, The Lone Ranger is a reasonably entertaining film, with a very strong performance by Depp. Yeah a few scenes you may have been like yeah right in your head but unlike Fast and the Furious 6, the special effects people on this project do a great job keeping it looking realistic. It had action (as promised), a good plot and pretty generous doses of humor for a movie of this genre. Johnny Depp is a master at facial expressions and this type of comedic timing."
7983,"It possesses beautiful sets and the colors are fluorescent. All the qualities of a fun character are embodied in him. The classic underdog (undersnail) tale, there aren't any surprises here lets put it this way. Also some good quotes which you may remember for a while ;' Snailed it' ' That snail is fast'. It's a whole load of fresh new characters and designs, excellent animation and lovely colours as usual with an animated film."
7975,"A true testament to the choices and experiences that shape you as a person. Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley are fantastic, particularly Woodley. The Spectacular Now won Sundance's special jury prize for acting and within minutes, the reason for this becomes apparent. While not perfect and falling just short of the level of those classics, it is nonetheless a welcome addition and quite interesting. It all comes together by the flawless performances by Woodley and Teller who are perfect for each other on screen."
7976,"It strong points were performances by Kristen Bell and Mammie Gummer. Overall, the story is brought to new heights with the outstanding performances by a cast including the likes of Veronica Mar's star Kristen Bell and Freaks and Geeks alum Martin Starr. Nice production and a convincing story of early middle - age indecision with nuanced acting by a strong cast of recognizable faces adds up to a satisfying film. The interactions between the two age groups were beautiful, as each learns and grows from the other. When the characters grow up at the end, Jason and Todd for the first time, Leigh and Mel for a second time, it's a mature choice, a step forwards."
7977,"The same scene moves from daylight to dusk, rain to sunshine, storm surge to quiet beach, with every single new camera angle. If you love sharks and tornadoes, well. A modern masterpiece that will surely be winning some Oscars. Sharknado is, truly, the cinematic experience of a lifetime. If it is raining very hard and floods are occurring, the inside of your house will flood first."
7978,"Coogler shows a good command of a scene and how to make it authentic. This is a film that has great performances and that keeps it above average on many levels. Overall, this is a film with powerhouse performances that needs to be seen. But by and large this is a moving, gripping, at times infuriating film that will stick with you after the credits roll. For a movie with a first time director, Fruitvale Station is a triumph."
7979,"A cool idea that is fairly well writtin and just an overall fun movie to watch. It's just plain good summer fun, with an interesting cast and a lot of laughs. For that same concept with the perfect blend of action and comedy, the two Hellboy movies are effectively perfect. Some of the most amusing moments emerge from the interplay between the characters, and the clever gag in which everybody sees them as different people. This movie is obviously a spoof on the Men - In - Black movies, with Jeff Bridges reprieving his Rooster Cogburn role, this time in a character named Roy, with highly amusing results."
7980,"The film has a very epic, cinematic feel to it and the action scenes are amazing. This is definitely the best of the DC animated movies thus far, (that's saying a LOT, btw), and is truly one to get excited about watching. It was great to see the interpretation of the New Earth variants well voiced and drawn, especially Slade and Black Manta. The music is haunting and beautiful at the same time, giving intensity to the action scenes and giving weight to the more emotional and dramatic scenes. Aquaman is finally given full credit and accurately shown as a nigh - invulnerable multi-powered heavyweight."
7981,"The craft is amazing and the performances are terrific. The choice to set the movie in the 70s was a stroke of genius as it feels so authentic and all the more real. The performances are pretty enjoyable as they take the viewers into the characters' mind. Wan's camera - work here is by far his best out of any of his movies. The acting is impressive, the practical effects are perfect and the classic 70s feel Wan was going for make for a great time at the movies."
7984,"the best scene in the film is a scene after the credits. ( B) The black ninjas, doing their thing in the middle of the night and flying across roof - tops. your favorite X-men character fights and moves with the grace of a rock. And to add to this, the after credits scene makes NO sense (powers wise) and backtracks / negates important aspects from the last movie, which is a very childish and unprofessional thing to do, even if the last movie was quite bad. The Wolverine is a movie that works both as a continuation of the X-Men storyline, as well as a standalone movie."
7985,"The films strongest point is the portrayal of realism in regards to adult relationships. Swanberg's script sets up situations in which a major conflict between the characters could break out at any second, but the film relies chiefly on its on - screen talent in order to work. "" Drinking Buddies "" completely and honestly captures the indefinable nature of contemporary relationships, it just doesn't say anything new about it. She's hilarious and buoyant and handles her dramatic moments - however fleeting or quiet - with expert skill. Long, realistic conversations with buddies, work colleagues and partners."
7986,"The jokes kept coming and were very skillfully timed. The acting was great and the story was well - written with actual twists. The soundtrack and sound effects made all the guns and explosions that much more convincing and enjoyable. Action - filled, funny, and wacky, with a tremendous cast that also includes Anthony Hopkins, this is a wonderful film, done in several European locations, so the scenery is great. Quality action scenes edited together very well to keep the motion going without getting lost."
7988,"This way he can see life pass him by right before his eyes; he won't need to turn on the TV or the evening news to realize it. Many Kudos to CollegeHumor for that rare comedy that you'll probably want to watch again immediately after your first viewing so as to be better prepared for the onslaught of funny. The extras, down to Phil's happy birthday opera being dismissed was really funny. The best thing about it however is it's writing, it is one of those movies that doesn't take itself too seriously and in that allows it to have quite juvenile humor. Brad Copeland's Coffee Town is a simple, satisfying picture, not intent on being offensive or taxing, but more fixated on being a fun ninety minutes one can enjoy without the burden of being too explicit, too sentimental, and too self - satisfying."
7990,"Blanchett is a wonder in this regard because there is something intensely fearless in her approach. The real talent on the side belongs to Sally Hawkins and Bobby Cannavale who give compelling and heartbreaking performances. As said before, Cate Blanchett may have given her best performance and that is a tough feat. Blanchett took a huge risk with that emotionally exposing role and proved herself to be master and commander. Sally Hawkins delivers quite a performance as Ginger, who is suffering from problems of her own."
7991,"Once again the lead is taken by Toni Servillo, who was Sorrentino's Andreotti in "" Il Divo "" and once again he confirms his position as one of the cinema's finest actors, heading a truly superb ensemble cast. The story is wonderfully told both by images and dialogues. The Great Beauty is such an unusual concoction of sights and sounds, it's a wonder it works at all. Literally bursting with the pulse of flawed humanity, The Great Beauty is a feast for the eyes, the ears, and the soul. A special mention goes to Sabrina Ferilli and Carlo Verdone, two very famous actors in Italy, shining here in two supporting roles where both of them display their undisputed talent."
7992,"Louis C. K. does his HBO special in Phoenix. And for that, Louis C. K. seems eternally connected to the grotesque and the morbid, but it's all enwrapped over a positive message: appreciate life and what you have. As subject they do rather fit within the subjects you would expect to hear from a standup, but Louis delivers them with a view and a conviction that leaves you in no doubt that he is speaking from his own experience and that this is more than just a funny bit. C. K. makes a point that being older makes a more intelligent and interesting person. A voice with true gravitas that he has earned from living a life."
7993,"There are constant deviations from the novel, only decent scripting, acting, visual effects, good music, and mixed acting. The gods Hermes and Chiron have replacements (Nathan Fillion and Anthony Head, respectively). This movie is enjoyable and entertaining for an action movie, and there are funny parts as well as suspenseful parts. He was smart, spoke clearly, and was even attractive with two eyes. The next few scenes slightly follow the book in a way that it is good enough to pass."
7994,"Jayma Mays is impressive as Grace. The look of the film is very pleasing with bright colors and tons of things happening on every part of the screen. The Smurfs 2 was lots of fun! All in all, The Smurfs 2 is loads of fun & is worth a watch. Hank Azaria is the standout performer as the bumbling wizard, Gargamel."
7995,"to keep the character fresh after 20 + years. The easiest way to describe this is like a British Anchorman with the constant over the top antics and the make - it - up - as - you - go feel. Everyone in the cinema was laughing out loud throughout the full 90 minutes. and then base a whole film at a radio station for 90 + minutes and entertain, that takes some writings. Steve Coogan is always worth watching though and anything with Partridge is as well so the movie is worth seeing if you are a fan of either."
7997,"Essentially he allowed the impressiveness of the moves and styles themselves to shine through. It felt like an authentic martial arts classic action film with some modern touches. Hoping for a blu - ray DVD with lots of extras. Kudos to Tiger Chen for the amazing action sequences in this film as well in the other movies he had been in as stunt coordinator and the like. Yes, it does have a few stiff and / or formulaic moments but given the genre and it being a directorial debut, this was inevitable ;) Also, in spite of the genre and the references / homages to other movies, Reeves' directing style is original."
7998,"Jennifer Aniston was just marvelous as always. It is an interesting combination of characters which work really well together. Loved the stripper scenes with Jennifer who looks as hot as ever. It's funny, has lots of fun twists, and some good comic lines. It's hard to say who pulls this off â€” clearly the "" parents "" are terrific, Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis."
7999,"To make it simple, Grown - Ups 2 felt like the first, if you enjoyed the first one you will probably enjoy this. Despite being universally panned by critics and movie goers, Grown - Ups managed to perform well enough at the box office to warrant a sequel. no, over 7 years old, you will leave disappointed. The best actor in this movie was a giant ex-NBA player - and he was horrible. The jokes aren't funny and undoubtedly the best performance comes from SHAQ."
8000,"Kick - Ass is full of intense action and hilarious comedy, it is one of the best mixes and on par with other action - comedy films such as Hot Fuzz , 21 Jump Street and Tropic Thunder! It had a completely new take on the superhero genre, it skillfully juggled both effective comedy and brutally violent action scenes, plus it had some pretty convincing characters and a dark storyline. The action scenes are still pretty brutal and effective, but the humour lacks that razor sharp edge that made the first one so believable despite its premise. What had made Kick - Ass so special was its ability to sustain an interesting story both for the audiences who are and who are not willing to delve into the deeper aspects of what makes a film truly shine. Simply put, if you walk into movies to see action, blood, and a whole lot of style, you will absolutely love Kick - Ass 2."
8010,"Performance, screenplay, dialogues etc all are first class. The performances, the screenplay, the direction and the soundtrack are first class. The acting is solid, and Rachel McAdams is lovely and inspiring. Very thought provoking and one which tugged at the old tear ducts in the best way. With Heart touching soundtracks and songs, the movie has Eye pleasing Scenes."
8001,"Chronicles wasn't so good but still was entertaining and fun to watch. Richard B Riddick is up to his old tricks again, and if you're a fan, you won't be disappointed, definitely a must see. Graphics were well - done, alien life wasn't anything unique but were suitably scary. Plenty of cheesy one - liners and good action scenes set in a sci - fi world. This is by far Twohy's strongest script with a surprising range of fleshed - out characters."
8002,"It manages to be colourful and well - textured with detailed backgrounds and well - designed characters. Planes does have things that it did do well. Cars 2, alone, had a number of amazing set - pieces and lighting techniques that were used perfectly. On an average, living - room - size Television, Planes probably looks pretty damn good. The film was originally conceived as a direct - to - DVD film and have a series of sequels follow accordingly."
8003,"Let's hope director Cowperthwaite's screams are heard. Thisis an extremely powerful documentary that's brilliantly structured, tragic and cinematic. But these are minor quibbles with a documentary that is as sickening as it is compelling. Well made and runs high on emotion, it will make the viewer contemplate on the scale of human tyrannism. Their experience working with Orcas - most having dedicated their lives to it - is truly heart breaking."
8004,"The backgrounds and color pallete are beautiful. He's one of those character actors who is fantastic at everything he does. Hayao Miyazaki's Most Beautiful film. This is one of those bitter sweet endings, where you don't know what to think at first. Hayao Miyazaki (Director and Writer) creates unique color palettes and designs."
8005,"In fact, the supporting acts steal the show, especially Mulroney's solid turn as Jobs' ally turned adversary. It's a great set - up for a slammin' movie. He probably had more bad moments than good, but it's the good ones that count. To his credit, Kutcher puts forth a good effort, and he undeniably looks the part of Steve Jobs. It is an affected performance, and Kutcher's limitations as a dramatic actor are all too apparent here."
8006,"The demons were gruesome, scary, and awesome! Lily Collins and Robert Sheehan stole the show in terms of solid, believable performances. This show had legitimate effects, great action scenes, and some really good acting performances. Words like' the Clave' ,' the accord', and others were thrown in without explanation. On the whole, the fight scenes were very engaging, particularly the ending sequences."
8007,"With a talented cast of three (Rosemarie DeWitt, Emily Blunt, and the wonderful Mark Duplass) it was a favorable experience to say the least. Pais especially captures the eccentricities of his character in a rather natural way. Shelton asserted herself in human dialog, and immersed herself in the breathtaking beauty of Seattle's woodsy environment, making the film easy - on - the - eyes and very effective. It is not a bad story, and it is told by a great cast, and the rural Seattle area looks great in the travel montages. Between Ellen Page, Allison Janney, and Rosemarie DeWitt, you have a great filmography between the three in which you will likely find the best drama or comedy movies of the past few years; and between DeWitt and Janney, you'll also find some of the best television of the past few years."
8008,"If you wind up drawing parallels between Emmett Till, Oscar Grant and Trayvon Martin after watching this film - then you probably got the intent - and most likely enjoyed it. The casting of the presidents Cecil worked for is flagrantly weird. What it is, is an exceptional, mature movie for those that want a little more than monsters (the fictional kind). The film is very loosely based on a real life butler - Eugene Allen (1919 - 2010) ) - who had worked in the White House for 34 years from Truman in 1952 to Reagan in 1986. All the blacks, including the Black Panthers, are good, innocent, humble, hard - working, harmless."
8009,"It's an impressive performance by Bell on all fronts! It's so rare to see someone on the screen who can be more than one persona. The movie is funny and touching in just the right places. From Demetri Martin, Rob Cordry and Lake Bell herself, the acting was fantastic. The cast across the board is great from the leads to a few smaller parts adding even more humour from the likes of Nick Offerman and Ig Notaro."
8091,"Anton's actions and behaviors are most closely aligned with that of such mythical creatures of an alp or incubus. ' Borgman' tells the story of a drifter (Jan Bijvoet) that slowly but suddenly takes control of the lives of a young, wealthy family living in a beautiful mansion somewhere in the Netherlands. Alex van Warmerdam's darkest and most disturbing film to date is also his best, perfectly balancing black humour and psychological terror. The etymology of "" Anton "" is' priceless', so placing one's faith in Anton is synonymous with placing one's faith in something that is priceless, an obvious parallel to two of the' 7 Deadly Sins': idolatry and greed. "" Camiel "" and "" Borgman "" is actually his job title, the etymologies of these names elude to the purpose he serves for Lucifer; his real name is given at the beginning of the movie, "" Anton "", which is believed to be a lie in an attempt to gain admittance to the house."
8012,"But most impressive is Vanessa Hudgens as Cindy. However, the real star of the film, perhaps somewhat surprisingly, is Hudgens, who makes her character look very real and believable. Cage does an excellent job in the role of Jack Halcombe. The atmosphere it creates is very authentic - it really takes you back 30 years ago in Alaska, when these gruesome events unfolded. He plays the role with a high amount of creepiness that's impressive considering it's such a different role for him."
8018,"It was much less annoying or even apparent than in movies like Transformers. That storyline, which is played out, was exhausted 5 minutes into the flick. Cars get destroyed left and right and you sit there and think: "" Yeah this should all be filled with tension and be exciting . """
8019,"It uses artistic and visual motifs well and feels well rounded and complete. All of them fit their parts very well and give the film its charm. The film is predictable overall but still brings some fresh moments. It's well written and acted and is able to balance many kinds of humors to please many people. It may not make their personal situations any complex, but it still is a memorable little romcom that shines through its humor and performances."
8020,"It also helps that the film has a first rate cast doing outstanding work: Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Terence Howard, Melissa Leo, Maria Bello and Viola Davis. Then, there's Jake Gyllenhaal as the second lead, playing an ambitious cop who holds a very impressive resume: no unsolved cases left under his plate. At 153 minutes, the film is detailed, precise, and engaging nearly throughout. The two have offered plenty of memorable performances in their filmography, but their work in "" Prisoners "" is cut and clear their best they've offered. Gyllenhaal still plays the role of a cop very well after all of that training for End Of Watch."
8021,"Likewise with Affleck, Harrelson and Saldana. But it turned out to be surprisingly good with strong performances from everyone involved. Casey Affleck and Zoe Saldana deliver good work on screen. The strength of this film relies on the performances, hands down. In essence, a major portion of the film's enticement should be accredited to the exceptionally powerful performances, and Casey Affleck remarkably fights for that recognition by showcasing his deteriorating soul."
8022,"But also, quite a credit to Hess to create an environment where good spirits flow. It has an amazing sarcastic tone and is chalk full of Austen references. Much has been written elsewhere about Jennifer Cooledge, the * other * American who supposedly paid for a week in "" Austenland "". Other cast members, including J. J. Field and Jane Seymour, are solid. Director Jerusha Hess (co-writer of Napoleon Dynamite) has a really remarkable debut."
8023,"With a great sway of emotions from melancholy to ecstatic! This film deserves the acclaimed reviews it has been receiving. Arguably BrÃ¼hl gives the stronger performance which should auger well for his future career. The film is bang on in period, cars fashion and sets the tone excellently, the cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking and the fx are very much in keeping with the period, no ridiculous CGI. It is similar to the excellent Control, Moneyball etc but with a bit of heart."
8024,"There is a plot, there is acting, there is everything that makes a great movie. The interactions among the family are good, supportive and genuine. The plot is basically about a family, the Mazonis, that was relocated to Normandy under the witness protection program. It's all in GoodFellas fun, a mildly amusing and unusual story that beats many mainstream comedies this year. Luc Besson makes a fine comeback with this funny gangster comedy - the script is witty, the pace is fast, there are sudden scenes of shocking violence, and equal doses of laugh out moments."
8025,"This is easily a star making role for Brie Larson, John Gallager Jr., and Kaitlyn Dever. It's a storytellers wet dream. These two scenes are extremely powerful and emotional and they stand out in the film without feeling forceful or manipulative at all. Mason is the ideal caregiver, loving and competent with the teenagers and her. Larson is a major reason why this film worked so well, her character Grace is just that: a graceful person who is doing her best to help these kids while at the same time trying to deal with her own demons."
8026,"And, throughout the film, this nineties feeling is very well kept alive, with the sets, the costumes, and such. The film starts with quite a crafty opening credits sequence, which quickly lets you know that you're being brought back to the early nineties (1993 to be exact). Narrative structure is clever, with check - boxes appearing every time one of the "" tasks "" is accomplished. It should get some more love and attention when it arrives on home video & PPV where it is sure to gain a word - of - mouth following. Brandy is a straight A student with strong morals who has always succeeded at everything she tries."
8027,"Will Forte surprisingly underplays and buries his normal comedic ticks and beats that made him so successful on "" Saturday Night Live . "" "" Nebraska "" reaches an emotional conclusion that echoes of "" About Schmidt "" and "" The Descendants "" (2011) with an underlying sense of lives largely squandered, but handled with grace and finesse that feels innately genuine. All Woody sees is that he won a million dollars. It runs as a light and comedic companion piece to Michael Haneke's "" Amour . "" 2 - Very thought - provoking, especially if you're in your 20s or 30s."
8028,"That's the beauty in their performances. But it's a gentle film in its very casual visual approach and lack of emotionally explosive scenes. They shed those past screen images with surprising ease and reveal effortless human beings. Interesting, intelligent and heart warming would perhaps be a fitting finale to the great James Gandolfini. It's incredibly funny at times and quietly poignant in others."
8045,"Cusack is good while Dalton, Shawn, Schaal, Rickles, and others are all good value. Overall a very enjoyable seasonal short film with high production values and high quality all round. This was definitely a nice way to see the toys again. It looks good of course, all the characters are present and correct with their original voices by the original stars which is nice. Dalton and Shawn are fantastic actually, the parts of Rex and Mr. Pricklepants playing nicely to their strengths."
8029,"The film offers up a good amount of laughs, and the purposeful repetitive narrative works in showing Jon's changing lifestyle. It strikes as a solid balance between art and entertainment, it's filled with lots of laughs and it touches on a sensitive topic in a way that doesn't seem preachy. The film has moments of laugh out loud humour, but it also has a tender and emotional side to it as well. JGL's script is well - intentioned and he is trying to make the point that many people become so self - absorbed that they lose the ability to interact with others on a human level. Don Jon is one of those movies that has plenty of laughs and a few heartfelt moments, and it's certainly entertaining."
8030,"The effects in this started out as distracting. The film starts off great, with the signature Michel Gondry style of bizarre visual feast. And Gondry added his touch: the visual effects are great, without CGI. This was when the totally new possibilities of film were being enthusiastically embraced, and for those long - gone creators the sky was the limit. It is fabulous how the director has created the most absurd situations and effects, giving the viewer the feeling of bouncing from one surrealist painting into another."
8031,"The beautiful Gemma Arterton is totally wasted here. To Furman's credit, he does what he can with a tepid script to draw in and retain his audience's attention, but there is so much he, or for that matter his stars Timberlake and Affleck, can accomplish. It's rather puzzling therefore - after' Gone Baby Gone' ,' The Town' and' Argo' - what Affleck saw in Brian Koppelman and David Levien's script or in director Brad Furman to commit to star in this by - the - numbers thriller that arguably adds little to the cred he's built up so far. The trailer strongly suggests an intelligent, exciting thriller of crime and intrigue with A-list stars, action, drama, plenty of danger and a soupÃ§on of violence. With the chance to join the super rich, all the pleasures it encompasses and, predictably, a beautiful woman, Rebecca (Gemma Arterton), who equally predictably is Block's girlfriend, Furst's life couldn't be any better."
8032,"The conversations are heartfelt, and the pain is evident and shared. Their emotional hardships feel completely real. Adapted by Kechiche and Ghalia Lacroix from the novel by Julie Maroh, Tunisian born French director Abdellatif Kechiche's fifth feature looks with piercing eyes into the coming - of - age years of AdÃ¨le (AdÃ¨le Exarchopoulos), and her relationship with the more mature Emma (Lea Seydoux), a relationship that does not fit anyone's pictures. The chance encounter leads to a relationship and the depiction of an explicit sex scene that is notable for its believability and the raw emotions that are expressed but has, unfortunately, become a source of finger pointing in some quarters. The struggles between the two lovers is depicted in breathtaking detail."
8033,"Now, that's some serious impressive sh*t. Breakthrough performer Barkhad Abdi is simply sensational. Truly a talent to look out for, Abdi nails this role. Tom Hanks gives one of his finest performances in a long time. In a fantastic casting choice, Tom Hanks is more than matched by Barkhad Abdi, who truly shines as the lead pirate."
8034,"While none are bona fide Hollywood stars, the cast that glitters in a maniacal, dirty way is a treat beyond expectation: Imogen Poots, Shirley Henderson, Gary Lewis (yes, Billy Elliott and his dad are reunited at last! ) There are plenty of treats strewn through' Filth', little cameos, smart, snappy dialogue, great jokes and wonderful performances from the likes of the ever versatile Jim Broadbent and Eddie Marsan. Whilst there is likely to be a good forty percent of casual viewers who are left completely cold, the remaining will see a successful, proudly Scottish film that is by turns dark, shocking, comical and moving, which also goes out on an incredibly catchy and surprisingly fitting 70's hit! The Cohen brothers may have the monopoly on fantastic character names, but nobody writes actual characters like Welsh and the cast that Baird has poured into Filth is staggeringly good in their interpretation of this mess of freaks and misfits. Scabrous, nasty, cold and angry, yet obviously vulnerable and lost, this is a perfectly balanced, well - rounded performance, and MacEvoy is perhaps most impressive when he is being everything at once!"
8092,"The story is so well done, it will carry you through the entire 113 minutes. The laughs are thoughtful, consistent, and sometimes enormous. Absolute jewel: D Stallone is 67 years old, and he is still the best. Yes there are some solid principles to live by in this movie. But they are all stars in this worthy story, filled with laughs, mystery, and drama."
8036,"As for Carrie, Chloe Grace Moretz did a fine job. It was very well made, and the modernization is appropriate without being too obvious of the change in times, i. e cell phones, the Internet, etc. . Chloe did deliver a chilling performance during the scenes where Carrie is exacting her revenge. All the efforts for the reimagining, whether it be an attempt to create a franchise or sequel or to modernize the narrative has totally undermined the essence of this otherwise compelling story. Her fresh - faced, squeaky - clean appearance throughout the film makes it's a hard swallow that Tommy (vacantly played by Ansel Elgort) could look at her wearing a dress and then suddenly be like "" Wow! """
8037,"The performances (the standout coming from Bardem) are all fine here. The directing is slick and stylish, and there are a few scenes that are actually brilliant to see unfold. The acting first and foremost is phenomenal, particularly Fassbender and Bardem. There was clearly a lot of thought put into camera angles, and where characters and objects were placed within the frame. The complexities that he brings to the part offer a welcome respite from the bland work by the leads."
8039,"Enough to say that the film is really original, well acted, with good production values and fantastic visuals. Equally there are other reviewers who love it, so it's proving to be a bit of a Marmite film. It's full of subtle humor that blends nicely with the depressed tone of the film, and you'll find yourself having a few good laughs when you recognize famous characters and actors as their cartoon avatars are presented. Ari Folman, the Israeli director and writer of this film, creates one of the most anti-Hollywood and anti-Holocaust films in a while. See this review on the Bath Film Festival blog: http: / / bathffblogger."
8040,"He comes off as a relatively good man who is trapped within the powerful confines of the institution of slavery. Cumberbatch was very good, though outshined by far by Michael Fassbender. Paul Giamatti, Paul Dano, Benedict Cumberbatch, Sarah Paulson, Alfre Woodard are all great in relatively small roles. A seemingly decent and caring man who treats his slaves with some semblance of respect and kindness. Paul Dano gets a few minutes of screen time as well but makes incredible use of it."
8041,"It's great in its deliberate confinements. CONTAINS SPOILERS - Outstanding performance, beautifully underplayed, gripping. For a man three years shy of his 80th birthday, Redford shows that he is still supremely fit. So even for sailors there were some nice hints of cutting corners, hubris and overconfidence. There are very few sailing movies and the reviews for this one where all great."
8042,"It's one of the most striking endings to a film like this in a long time. Definitely see it in the theater if you can - the battle room scenes are best on a big screen. The actors are great, Asa Butterfield absolutely owns the role of Ender Wiggin, effortlessly switching emotional gears when needed. Enders control of the battle and being able to change perspective and zoom in and out were nice. Other supporters like Abigail Breslin, Hailee Steinfeld and Ben Kingsley also bring a lot of charisma to the screen and make even small roles memorable."
8044,"Though giving the red umbrella (and the red umbrella alone, in a sea of umbrellas) extra long eyelashes and her human rain boots with 3 "" heels felt a bit unnecessary. And also displays their talent to send you through a series of emotions within seven minutes. The grates gurgle, the pipes puff, the pedestrian meters flash. This idea might seem quite simple but director Saschka Unseld does a very good job at making it move at a very good pace and also keeping the viewer interested in what's going on. And very well may go down in history as one of Pixar's best short subjects."
8046,"Jackass knows how to make pranks work, and here is easily their best work. He's extremely convincing and talented, and even if you don't like kids (in general or in movies), you'll end up loving Billy. Whilst not nearly the best comedy released in 2013, this is surely the funniest. There are even some moments of inspired comic genius: chiefly, the set - pieces that take place in a strip club and at a beauty pageant. It's good to see Jackass stalwart and co-creator Jeff Tremaine handle both the situations and actors so well and one senses that this creation will set forward more projects under the similar vein of real life candid cameras mixed with a anchoring plot line."
8047,"It was really good and it was directed by Kenneth B. who is the man who made The best adaptation of Hamlet Ever. Stellan Skarsgard is one of the most fascinating character actors in Hollywood. The makers had so much to work with, considering in the comics what a clever sorcerer he is, as well as a deranged homicidal madman. She was alright in the first but she always has to say HOLY SH*T 500 times a scene. Hiddleston makes for a great Loki but that is literally the only good or interesting thing in the entire film."
8048,"Maron's stand - up is like that as well, though there is a focus to it if you can pay attention. Maron has been a frequent guest on the Late Show with David Letterman and made more than 40 appearances on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, more than any other standup performer. In this Netflix outing, however, the perfectly - titled Thinky Pain, he's straight out hilarious. Maron's demeanor, his spot - on observations, his priceless personal stories and the way he tells them, his superb timing, his palpable and oddly endearing angst, and most of all, his willingness to lay it all out there and share himself fearlessly, to just trust that he will be able to hold the audience's attention in an organic way, which he does effortlessly here. Probably the funniest is how he is so self - reflective and can find the hardcore pain in the comedy of his situations."
8049,"There's clearly a lot of anger in this film concerning the way society has let down these boys and forgotten about these communities. Barnard doesn't pull any punches but there is a surprising level of compassion and grace from the adults which really pulls on your emotions. While there may be a touch of melodrama with the theme of the mother's concern and the pacing it thrives off of seems unnatural, what makes the film work is that it still feels authentic in its performances and script. Barnard makes a subtle comment on child exploitation, but far more on the world commodities boom which has led to many people taking huge risks where copper has become the new gold. There are some wonderfully emotionally funny scenes equally matched by ones of sadness."
8052,"Big moments were spectacular and the little moments intimate. By the way: Mary Steenburgen is beautiful. Score was well done (good job, Mark Mothersbaugh! ) The camaraderie exhibited by these stars is enviable as well as appreciated. They have enjoyed much and suffered much in their lives, apart and together."
8069,"This is DiCaprio's crowning achievement. The stand out is obviously Leonardo DiCaprio, who pretty much owns and excels any scene he is in. Each shot also looks precise, even during some of the more chaotic scenes. A lot of the credit of the film's overall success has to be awarded to Leonardo DiCaprio. Robbie is pure magic and is everything she's required to be."
8053,"Muscle Shoals is a triumph, though. Muscle Shoals is jammed full of great music, colourful characters and wonderful anecdotes. Photography, editing, sound values, emotional through lines, entertainment value--this film has it all. However, there's more to the film than that--it is quite interesting, has some surprisingly big name musicians who gave interviews (such as members of the Rolling Stones, Bono and some great R&B legends) and terrific music! Let the participation of such bright lights as Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Bono, Jerry Wexler, Percy Sledge, Alicia Keys, Gregg Allman, Clarence Carter, and Etta James serve as a testament to the enduring magic that is Muscle Shoals, FAME studios, and that greasy, soulful sound."
8055,"This movie is absolute perfection & that's why Nick's Reel Screen Review is a perfect 4 stars out of 4, and that's for one of the year's best in "" Philomena "". All the performances are first - rate and in the title role Judi Dench is simply phenomenal. As several critics have observed, this wonderful film, just shown at TIFF, is destined to become this year's King's Speech (which began its Oscar run in Toronto too, though Philomena has already picked up accolades in Venice). If you are a Judi Dench fan this movie is a must - see, if you are a Steve Coogan fan this is a must - see, and if you are a fan of truly great movies You won't find those jarring moments here - Philomena is expertly judged and balanced."
8056,"It's nuanced, extremely thoughtful and features some of the strongest performances of the year. Performances by the entire cast, no matter how small or large a role they play, are certainly deserving of praise. From the very opening scenes this film draws you in. It gleams like the sun, glistens like rays on the surface of water - for here is a dark tale that lights up the very soul. This is without a doubt one of the most riveting, thought - provoking, and utterly powerful movies for young people (or any people, for that matter)."
8057,"This, and the quite audacious camera angles, the ever so close close - ups that only half a face remains visible. Agata Kulesza (Wanda) and Agata Trzebuchowska (Anna / Ida), are immensely talented actors. With an unusually short film length of less than 90 minutes, Ida is an extremely well made film, sensitively directed by Pawel Pawlikowski. Even more effective is Agata Kulesza as Ida's bitter and alcoholic Aunt Wanda. Under the backdrop of 1960's Poland, the film's premise of presenting contrasting religions and lifestyles is its main attraction."
8070,"This is a balanced portrayal of multi-layered characters. A reviewer was right when he said Chadwick had done a by - the - numbers job on it. It looks good with attention to period clothing and artifacts and use of actual sites and some breathtaking countryside (it was shot entirely on location in South Africa). Great performances in a fantastic movie. Yet, allowing for all of this, by any standards "" Mandela "" is a success, telling a powerful story in a honest and immensely moving manner with some outstanding acting."
8060,"The set pieces are also vastly improved upon: bigger, more ambitious and work perfectly in sync with the action to make for some really unforgettable moments. The arena looks beautiful and foreboding, hiding it's dangers behind the shining green water. The Victors' Tour meeting scenes were definitely far from adequate to reflect the revolutionary atmosphere in the districts. Josh Hutcherson though, put in a better performance. Great acting and some strong scenes are burdened by poor dialogue and weak directing."
8061,"The story is full of illogicalities. The CGI in LOTR looked far more convincing and epic, the large establishing shots looked like grand paintings come alive. Both the story - telling and the story itself has a great number of intricate and humorous moments. The Hobbit has a completely different spirit than the LOTR trilogy. He only shines in his scene with Smaug."
8062,"Their reactions provide some of the most emotionally resonant moments in the entire film. Some genuinely emotional moments and serviceable action and effects make this a good but flawed film. Once you've accepted the sillier aspects of the film for what they are, it's easy to get swept along by its very earnest drama and spectacle. The sets have an epic feel that is grounded and doesn't feel to fantastic, but rather believable. Casting Reeves as the outsider allows him to do what he does best: play the role with stony - faced reserve, whether he's levelling up by battling demons in cage matches or pining moodily after Mika."
8063,"It is a major treat to see him interact with some of the youngsters who play his children. Yes, the premise that a person could actually donate sperm so many times and the number of kids to whom he now is the biological father is kinda funny. He is an endearing character chasing his 500 odd children and most bring flashes of hilarity whilst the rest bring a nice emotional warmth. Apart from his serious moments, Vaughn also has fun chemistry with Chris Pratt who plays his best friend. Against the advice of her lawyer best friend Brett (Chris Pratt), and while trying to mend the relationship he has with his girlfriend Emma (Cobie Smulders), David decides to set out and see how his children turned out."
8064,"The best of the supporting cast has to be given to Mads Mikkelsen who plays the dangerous and smooth crazy ex of Gabi, Nigel. Thats really what keeps you going right there. The acting from Shia Lebouf as a confused lost young man is topnotch. In a role that showcases a talent that is missing far too often in his other projects LaBeouf delivers here in what could be his best role outside of kids classic Holes. LaBeouf is well supported by the other cast members and in particular by a menacing Mads Mikkelsen who continues to impress in everything he does."
8065,"This is an amazing episode that will be cherished, revered, and most of all, REMEMBERED, in the many years to come. From the absolutely brilliant banter, to the amazing special effects, everything was perfect. Yeah, it was neat to see Tennant and Smith together, and Mr. Hurt brought his own palate to the show. The final scene with all the Doctors is wonderful, an awe - inspiring, loving homage to the series. How it is used for the "" time fissure (a tear in the fabric of time), which is able to open a gateway that brings three Doctors (Time Lords) together "" is ingenious."
8066,"Gorgeous visuals, stunning backdrops and intricacies like you have never seen before. It provides the one glimpse of true majesty, the sort of quality that would explain all of the extremely positive "" this is the greatest "" reviews that are being posted by others. The comedy hits right on the mark and the action packed adventure and thrilling journey make this a tale with a little bit of everything in the exact right amounts. Frozen is very pretty, very glitzy, full of beautiful landscapes, amazing snow shots and glamorous gowns. It is a daring movie that is laugh out loud at the some moments and stunning and provoking at others."
8068,"Inside Llewyn Davis is an intimate, well - executed, and honest slice of life. Having said all this, Inside Llewyn Davis is first and foremost a comedy in the Coenesque sense of the term. This is just brilliant filmmaking and the Coens prove once again that they are on top of their game. There are oddly poetic scenes in the film. Oscar Isaac is exceptional as Llewyn Davis."
8073,"So refreshingly real, and so much talent on all sides, actors included. Paul Giamatti asks, "" Because you do what you must . "" Paul Giamatti continues to elevate himself to one of the greatest working actors today. His performance, which naturally brings many of the film's biggest laughs, is one of the Rudd's most surprising portrayals to date. But with the talent of Rudd and Giamatti, then the audience are introduced to two very different characters, that are each individually very likable for better or worse."
8074,"In an era of resurgent wealth and dynamic lifestyles, success is achieved with compelling ambitions amidst increasing competitiveness, only through some hustle. Perhaps that is the year's biggest hustle from Hollywood that bends the audience into liking material that is portrayed to be far greater than it should be accorded for. She portrays wit, grace and spontaneity as they adapt to changing scenarios during the sting operation and remains ever focused on the plan. This movie is a classic case in amateurish, dialogue - heavy scenes. The believability comes from the characters and their relationships, set up by a story, or plot."
8075,"The pathos of the main character is well - captured in subtle ways, as are the feelings of triumph when he is able to go beyond his own self - imposed limitations. Kristen Wiig was outstanding--as usual. Fantastic views, simple yet wonderfully poignant story line and strong lead actor. It's funny, thought provoking, touching at times and startling at others. Accompanied by a truly beautiful soundtrack, Oscar - worthy camera work, and the surprisingly able acting of Ben Stiller, as well as an accompanying cast which includes Adam Scott, Kirsten Wiig and Sean Penn, among others, this is heart - warming and truly special."
8076,Everything about it was so beautiful. Joaquin Phoenix is utterly credible as are all the other leads. He delivers such a powerful and emotional performance and the close ups are there to capture it all. One of the best scripts ever written. Spike Jonze is a master story weaver at the top of his game.
8077,"And there is also quite generous footage of the some of the shows he was a part of either as lyricist or composer. These three actors have the charm and innocence and musical presence that was required of the original roles, and they recreate the period and excitement with thrilling results. Although he began as a lyricist, the genesis of "" Something's Coming, "" clearly show that it is HE who is the driving force behind the song. This is a wonderful documentary, composed chiefly of interviews Stephen Sondheim has given in the past, with the addition of the musical numbers, some specifically filmed for this HBO documentary."
8079,"It forces everything on the action, and the realistic portrayal of the unbelievable hardship and pain, and death, that comes along the way. The film opens with actual footage of the over the top training and stress imposed on elite fighting units such as the Navy Seals. Even as pure fiction the movie has enough kinetic and heroic acts to succeed on its own terms. Lone Survivor stands as an outstanding account of bravery and comradeship under fire, with acts of selflessness abounding. Incorporating real footage of the Navy Seals mixed with the actors lets viewers feel for the real life persons and their portrayed characters in the film."
8081,"An extra point for the nice portrayals by the young cast. The movie is nicely told and directed by director Gary Entin. It's appeal, whilst obviously aimed towards adolescents, is genuine. Probably geared towards young adults, it should be seen by anybody. Its a good watch and shows real problems that people face today."
8082,"He brings amazing range and emotion to a character that is simultaneously a loving, sweet father and a man caged in by life and personal demons. "" There's a lot of voice work, the way he walks, the body positions, the way he holds his hands, the way he touches his moustache. Demonstrating that her novel holds such personal significance, Travers continues to exercises a stubborn reluctance to hand the rights to her book over to what she considers to be a dollar - printing machine. "" She was a wonderful case study, requiring so many different shades. There are some outstanding performances here."
8083,"the subtlety and nuances of the original are just lacking. Olsen provides a surprisingly warm emotional centre to the movie, especially in portraying the love angle between her character and Joe - which happens to be one of the ancillary additions Protosevich has brought to this adaptation. The poetic overall tone from the original is absolutely lost and got replaced by pure clichÃ©s. The original film achieves a sublime blending of ultra-violence with extreme art, while the remake feels bogged down in its copycat status, and its overall lighter tone hampers its enigmatic, disconcerting story of revenge. Spike Lee's' reimagining' of the Park Chan - Wook cult classic' Oldboy' is a queer creature despite the notable absence of the original's iconic octopus - slurping scene."
8084,"The first one had tons of quotable lines. Ugh, his love interest was a mix of Brick and Kristen Wiig's character from Bridesmaids. To those who are fans of Ron Burgundy and his band of idiots and who have yet to see it, just remember that you will have to watch this again and again in order to really appreciate it. Over time and after re-watching these movies again and again, the jokes get rediscovered and the movie gets funnier. Happy Days coined the term "" jumping the shark, "" generally used for a television show that is declining in quality and attempts to use an outrageous plot device to keep viewer's interest."
8085,"The wagons themselves have amazing character. 7: People take loosing their limbs SHOCKINGLY well in this movie. Class struggle is naturally the topic of so many sci - fi films, from classics like "" Fahrenheit 451 "" and "" 1984 "" to contemporary derivatives such as "" District 9 "" and "" Elysium . "" Based on the French graphic novel, Le Transperceneige written by Jean - Marc Rochette, Snowpiercer is an ambitious dystopian sci - fi film that despite having a very absurd premise works really well thanks to Bong's direction. Bong has directed several successful Korean films like The Host and Memories of a Murder, and in his first English language film his style remains untouched."
8087,"Dupieux's films collectively are like a breath of fresh air in a stodgy and self - important film culture. A lot of the characters are unlikeable as people, but enjoyable to observe. Wrong Cops is a movie you should also be in the mood for the first time you see it. While its not old yet, people may still enjoy this 20 years from now. If you like David Lynch, Alejandro Jodorowsky, etc. - films that go over the top with their surrealism and absurdity, films that never feel quite comfortable and familiar yet which you can't look away from, you will love this film."
8094,"The music is great too and blends perfectly with the atmosphere. Beauty in many forms: you get a lot for your eyes. The sets are rich and perfectly put together, the performances are flawless from each and every member of the cast no matter how long their involvement. Tom Hiddleston is Adam, Tilda Swinton is Eve and Jim Jarmusch is a genius. The balance between emotive writing and gentle quiet spaces within the script are total perfection."
8096,"So if you're a fan of DBZ, chances are likely you'll have a pretty good time here. Four grown Saiyans and a fetus that carries Saiyan blood are good enough. Aside from the fantastical, frenetic action this series is known for, this most fun the Dragon Ball franchise has seen in a loooonnngg time. And at this point Bills is easily winning. Anyway, it's definitely a great addition for DBZ fans."
8097,"One is the sparkling, naturalistic performances from the children. The subtleties and nuances in his facial expressions were particularly impressive. Koreeda always works well with kids. This is indeed what Hirokazu Koreeda did, in his inimitable languid style. Ryota is a wonderful character made even better by the phenomenal performance by Masaharu Fukuyama."
8105,"She basically gives them her blessings with her touch. How did she go from being able to make things move, to being able to start fires, to being to control others? And move things she does: knives into adopted parents necks, credenzas into their legs, etc: you name, she'll move it right into you. The best horror cinema uses the supernatural to shine a light on the real life horrors of this world, Marina de Van's portrait of an abused child's psyche is disturbingly realistic and deeply unsettling. Throughout the film Neve has this odd whistle and her ears ring, causing her pain."
8106,"The story begins with flashback and there are some moments of excitement. Aditya n kalki perform well again n give a a strong supporting cast. Win win situation for Ranbir Kapur. Ayan is certainly one of the top young directors in the industry, and after Wake Up Sid, shows exactly why he holds his mantle piece. And hats off to the super excellent & brilliant performances of Ranbir Kapoor & Deepika Padukone in this film."
8110,"This is a small scale film, well aware of its limitations which on the whole punched nicely above its weight. The main characterisations within the film were well drawn. Filmed with great width, there are some gorgeous and hair - raising waves showcased here. Xavier Samuel, in one of his best performances, brings charisma and energy to his role. there are some good as well as bad choices in this film."
8114,"The first two minutes were interesting. ' Nyphomaniac' is a classic frame story. She happily screws anyone and anything that she lays eyes on. As unbelievable as it sounds to them, the purpose of both the film and the sex scenes go much deeper. The profound message is that sex must be presented strictly in terms of social isolation and as a manifestation of emotional disturbance."
8115,"The images are memorable, the performances are very well rounded and this is just a very very well done film. She seems hopeful that he's changed but the recent events where he hides his meeting with Adam have her wondering if he's returned to old habits. - mother), the cinematography by Nicolas Bolduc and the music score by Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans are stunning. There is a supporting cast as well, with MELANIE LAURENT and SARAH GADON both who are really great opposite the two Jakes. On the surface, ENEMY is about history teacher Adam Bell (Gyllenhaal)."
8119,"Not happy, however, is the over-the-top reactions of Jason Jones' Interpol agent, Bick. Overall, heist movie fans will love this. If you like Jay Baruchel's acting, you'll get some great scenes with him too. Most of this cast is Canadian, and top quality, it is a nice change really to not have just one, or two big name Canadians, then just a lot of fresh faces. While not action packed like Italian Job or movies of the sort, it was still a great watch."
8120,"Charlotte is wonderful, as are all the other actors. The viewers are supposed to believe that they are watching something arty and intelligent, and thus might feel less turned off."
8121,"This movie is actually pretty funny if you know LARPers. There are some great characters, and great "" in - story "" world - building by the LARPers, but it all degenerates into a big slug-fest with a rubber - suit monster. Some characters are great, others aren't. Peter Dinklage is wonderful as usual and Summer Glau's performance - she was was fantastic. The movie has a incredible cast with Peter Dinklage, Summer Glau, Ryan Kwanten, and Steve Zahn."
8122,"This movie is easily the best film he has made in the last 30 or so years. It's wonderful to see a film that knows exactly what it wants to be with no pretensions towards greatness. Amalric is a superb choice for this role with his mousy, intellectual temperament a perfect complement to Seigner's looks and physique. Amalric and Seigner worked so well together with an electric chemistry that transcends language barriers and subtitles. Although created for the New York stage, director Roman Polanski totally inserts himself into the action via actor Mathieu Amalric who once again delivers a wonderful screen performance to match Seigner's."
8124,"He blends very well into everything, but his power oozes out of everything. The special effects are mostly wonderful, and the neon - coloured world through which the black - clad Qohen stalks practically bursts at the seams with detail and imagination. Leth's success would mean the identification of the conditions that could lead to the collapse of Lord management's world. When the night of death comes, Leth is happy, for what he experiencing is real. But, within these archetypes, The Zero Theorem finds something fascinating to say."
8128,"Performances are real strong across the board and elevate this material greatly. CCTN overall really came across with the strong performances from the cast and sold what would otherwise be an average thriller. , and Cranston, Eve, and Parker's performances were stellar, which is the result of excellent directing as well as acting. Some clever filming enables the audience to experience things through the eyes of the protagonists. Some layers, twists, and reversals, but it's still very easy to follow and, therefore, may be a little too episodic and simple for some tastes."
8130,"More importantly, however, the film has some excellent things going for it. In terms of storyline, this is an interesting film, told in a linear, non-confusing fashion. Bruce LaBruce has a special fantasy. The performances are great, particularly Walter Borden, and the soundtrack is glorious. It is to LaBruce's great credit that he treats this controversial subject with just the right amount of restraint, avoiding the lurid, but not being afraid to call a spade a spade."
8135,"Although you may see the underlying basics, you are nevertheless entertained and laughing in your seat. It's for Van Damme completists only, and he is really good. The simplicity of the plot wouldn't have garnered a watch in most cases, but there are a few scenes with JCVD that are hilarious. All the acting is more than adequate for a screwball comedy and it has it's share of laughs and silliness. And while there is a journey, it's the isolation of the Jungle and the characters (used to work in offices), that make this movie funny."
8138,"For now, it's reassuring to know they've got a place to find the answers. Ultimately PARTICLE FEVER is an uplifting film that demonstrates the value of common research, and how it can be conducted across all platforms and all disciplines. Put another way, they admit that "" truth "" is a relative term, dependent on the context in which the term has been employed; this knowledge lies at the heart of all "" artistic "" endeavors as well. Much of the drama, at least for those unfamiliar with the data CERN has provided over the years, concerns this particle. When one operate a gigantic, costly collider, you need press coverage, in order to do that, CERN must provide insights."
8140,"It's exceptionally well acted with Healy, Embry and Koechner playing their respective roles famously. This is a disturbing, yet compelling watch and draws parallels in how quickly society would collapse without order and is extremely depressing in that this kind of' entertainment' is not something that would be discounted in a future society. Pat Healy and Sara Paxton made a terrifically witty duo in Ti West's limp, The Innkeepers and deserved to appear in a much better film. Though fairly simple and straightforward on the surface, "" Cheap Thrills, "" written by Trent Haaga and David Chichirillo and directed by E. L Katz, is really a modern - day parable about greed, desperation, exploitation and the dangers of unbridled macho bravado. In case you've never heard of it, Cheap Thrills is a black comedy thriller directed by horror journalist turned director E. L. Katz."
8142,"A film is the sum of its scenes and this one has some excellent, excellent scenes. It takes some effort to keep up and fill in the blanks (an easy film this is not), but the rewards are ample. The critics had made bold comparisons with Stanley Kubrick, which in itself is a massive compliment. Enjoy the wonderful soundtrack, sublime camera work, the eeriness and Scarlet's stunning performance (all actors were great) and all the nuances and themes. You can throw arguments of it was beautifully crafted or had symbolic serenity, but at the end of the day it is slow, uneventful and lacked culmination."
8153,"It is beautifully shot and well edited, the soundtrack is on point and best of all - the leading actress shows such a refreshing talent. Then she strikes you with all kind of emotions, acted out almost easily. Life is good in Germany, you can tell by movies like this. If you're one of the people who thought that tampon - sharing and anal fissures were underexplored topics in contemporary cinema, or cinema in general, here's a film that gives you a nod and a thumbs up. If you see it with your friend, relative or God forbid: a family member - it might lead to complications in your relationship and you don't need anymore of that."
8146,"The envelope is constantly being pushed in Bad Words. If you enjoyed Seth MacFarlane's Ted, you'll love Bad Words. Even the inherently creepy parts were more funny than creepy. Despite his crass approach to everyone and everything around him, Bateman's Trilby is someone you can't help but like; this is certainly in no small part due to Bateman's overall likability as a person and an actor. With some heartwarming moments, this movie is more than just a rude comedy."
8149,"It's a ferocious watch, and superbly realised by Jack O'Connell playing Eric, a star in the making for certain. It's no surprise because the best prison dramas that have come out over recent years come from Europe (think Bronson, Hunger, and A Prophet). Starred Up is hailed as O'Connoll's' break through' film, and there's no doubt he's running the show here, firmly commanding his presence as the explosive thug with raging personal issues blaring inside him, in a role that he's got form with and suits well. Aside from this, the film is well made and represents prisoners pretty well. All in all however, Starred Up is one of the best prison dramas in a long time, and probably the best British film this year."
8151,"But fans of the National will appreciate the depressive undertones which are beautifully and subtly brought to the foreground. A likable fellow that can to no awareness of his own, ruffle feathers and mess things up even though his heart is in the right place. One of the most real movies you may ever see. Seems like both brothers have found a way to channel their own frustration through their art, and the results are very enjoyable in both cases. This is the story of Matt Berninger, lead singer of the National's younger brother (by 9 years) Tom attempting (and succeeding) to make a documentary of the band on tour."
8156,"The dialogue is really believable; and the three lead performances are super natural. It is definitely a film that can be enjoyed by adults as well as teenagers. The actresses do a stellar job in making the conversations and interaction seem very believable. Very good description of the joy and energy of youth that are just beginning to form strong friendships, stand up for themselves (and each other) and explore their creativity and define themselves interacting with the world. It's a feel - good film, and serious issues are framed in the most palatable way--but the movie makes no pretensions and it it was it is, and that is a first - rate film, great for all ages, that has everyone leaving with a smile!"
8160,"Good performances from all including the kids. Tons of thrills, tons of fun. At some points the story is getting so intense and interesting and then BLAM! The entire cast gives strong performances, and you actually care about the well being of these characters. A better more polished film, Oculus was as eerie and involving as it was particularly complex in its non-linear storytelling."
8169,"The two child protagonists are extraordinary! There have been some outstanding child performances this year including that of Tye Sheridan, Liam James, Kacey Mottet Klein, and others, but none better than little Sitthiphon Disamoe's in Kim Mordaunt's The Rocket. Very interesting and a decent film for the family--even with its many references to urine, testicles and the like. Submitted as Australia's entry into this year's Academy Awards foreign film category and playing well to festivals the world over its clear many feel an affection for this unique and often heart - warming tale. The sensitive storyline includes many layers that give it texture, which makes it such a rich movie and exiting journey for the audience."
8170,"There are some incredibly memorable moments and lines and a crazy cast of characters that won't seen be forgotten. A success that has spread to a lot of other countries as well. A mixed audience, with surprisingly many pensioners, which have read the book, will probably guarantee the film to be an even bigger success than the novel. First of all the make up job they do on him as the 100 year old is amazing and he perfectly manages to play Allan across many, many decades and is believable. Robert Gustafsson, playing Allan, is just turning 50, but here he looks perfect both in the twenties, the thirties and as 100 years old."
8171,"It's so smooth and sleek, from the highway shots to the few overhead shots of the city at night. It's a wonderfully written movie, wonderfully directed, perfectly acted (seriously, this is the performance of Hardy's career), with a spot - on supporting cast of voices. It makes you imagine, stimulates your curiosity and plays with your nerves. Clocking in at just under 90 minutes, Locke is refreshingly short and never over stays its welcome. Everything flows so smoothly and Tom Hardy's performance completely captures everything you'd expect from this character as he's experiencing these dilemmas - you believe every word out of his mouth and every subtle nuance in his expressions."
8173,
8174,"Entering into Jodorowsky's world is like falling into a visionary dream where anything and everything is possible. With interviews with director Nicolas Winding Refn and basically everyone involved in the project, the world of Jodo is laid bare - and it's a breathtaking sight. Credit for that goes of course to director Frank Pavich, but let's be honest: he couldn't have had a more enjoyable subject than Alejandro Jodorowsky, who turns out to be a master story teller. Frank Pavich's fascinating documentary features an extended interview with Jodorowsky who talks about his epic vision for the project. Couple of comments: first and foremost, if you are a movie enthusiast, you are in for a finger - lickin' good time!"
8175,"The sets alone are worth the trip. all the while she is being still, you can see her mind and emotions running a mile a minute as her eyes are incredibly expressive. - Nick Kostopoulos - See more at: http: / / www. As she grows into a young woman, Dido's life at the palatial estate of Kenwood is full of mixed blessings. Gugu Mbatha - Raw as Dido is not only visually stunning but theatrically breathtaking."
8176,"This is one of her very best performances, and it should, in no way, be discounted. The plot is solid and the performances are impressive, particularly Marion Cotillard and Juaquin Phoenix. A true chef d'oeuvre and a feast for the senses. The performances are excellent, the characters are complex, and the cinematography captures the reality of the historical period with a raw beauty. Marion Cotillard perfectly transmits vulnerability and resistance at the same time."
8180,"The directing by Jeremy Saulnier was handled expertly and was feast for the eyes. A great film, well worthy of the 90 minutes it takes to get through, and a clear sign that this filmmaker has a very successful future ahead of him. The gamut of emotions that run through Dwight's (Macon Blair) eyes alone is worth the price of admission. One of the strongest achievements in recent years in independent cinema is "" Blue Ruin "". This is a well shot (some creative use of visual techniques and shot selections in this film), well written, engaging film that draws you in and keeps you watching right to the very end, despite the fact that it deliberately takes in time in various places."
8186,"The entire cast is great and Ruffalo certainly delivers one of his strongest performances. The characters are drawn in such a way that they are both like - able and relatable. It can be predictable and sappy at times, but it does it well. The way they bring the performances and the creative process to life - the pain, the joy, the failures and triumphs - is just thrilling. There is a nice dynamic between the characters which makes the movie enjoyable to watch."
8190,"Beautifully acted, great place to shoot, strong script, well defined characters with a very strong feeling. Hence the really delicate work in facial expression and body language throughout, especially as the leads increasingly open up and connect. The acting by all the players was first rate; the writing and dialog was crisp and real; filming and direction were beautifully done. It is pure entertainment that wins over an audience within minutes. This movie has a very strong touch of pure Love and emotions."
8197,"Rachel Nichols is a very talented actress, very good at portraying real heartfelt emotions, and relatable vulnerability, among other things. Whilst the teary eyed drama makes a precarious balance with the blood and guts of the fight scenes, perhaps the most impressive feature here is the sense of hopelessness which is created. That this idea is set up by a bunch of mad - eyed religious fanatics strains credibility, although the contrast between opulent upper class, and filthy stone - walled dungeons is nothing new, yet remains valid. She puts up a good fight for a bit, she even gets her on the ground and almost has her choked out, but Sabrina' taps out' asking for mercy. Acting is generally nothing special, but then, the real drama of this situation comes not from the script, or the over-embellishment of certain of the actresses, but in the heat of the fight sequences, in the minute reactions, in the bursting of the welled up emotions and fears, and in sharing that feeling."
8199,"The sense of place and aesthetic is intelligently realised, and for all its oppressive qualities, this film is a beautiful thing to look at. She certainly deserves to be called one of the best actresses of all - time and this just confirms it further. When Juliette does open her mouth to deliver her monologues, they are absolutely riveting, emotional and affecting. It premiered In competition at the 63rd Berlin International Film Festival in 2013, was shot on location in real asylums in France and is a French production which was produced by producers Jean BrÃ©hat, Rachid Bouchareb and Muriel Merlin. As you can gather it's not exactly a barrel of laffs but for students of great acting it is richly rewarding and, in its own way, as fine a movie as the previous telling of the Claudel story, featuring Isabelle Adjani and Gerard Depardieu which could, of course, by virtue of its coverage of her early life, be retitled Camille Claudel: Part One."
8210,"For a first time effort from John Maloof, this one is very well done. Yet, what comes through most vividly in her work is its humanity, her ability to capture the essence of people from all ages and walks of life in a single moment in time. They are particularly effective because they're based on reality, and when they're well made, one appreciate the art behind the camera, and the full impact of the qualities of the subject matter. Her personality was too strong and her emotions so powerful, they were hard to ignore. Finding Vivian Maier is easily of the best documentaries of the year."
8249,"The result is that' Coherence' becomes an instant scifi crowd pleaser. Scenes propel themselves to other scenes with fast and snappy dialogue. If material objects are preserved, so may be are people as well. Not much twists, but last few twists are really good. If you have a bit of intelligence and 20 minutes patience - you will be rewarded."
8221,"The film is well crafted, actors are brilliant, cinematography is interesting, but it explores what Festen has done better in the past. And under the skillful direction of Alexandros Avranas, who also co-wrote the script, as the secrets are revealed, so the tension increases. The females have learned to accept their degradation as something normal. What matters is his own face to society, to keep up appearances. The woman is rendered to an object for pleasure, for cooking, for cleaning, anything to satisfy the primary male in the family."
8222,"The dance scenes with the children are uplifting and lovely. The drama is laced with genuinely funny moments and the film is never dull despite the languid pace of many scenes. The film is beautifully shot, and the scenes and sounds of Australia are magical. His portrayal of Charlie gives important insight to the issues facing the indigenous people who have lived on the land for centuries. It is great to see some fine supporting talent in the likes of Luke Ford, Gary Sweet, Peter Djigirr, Bojana Novakovic and Dan Wyllie."
8228,"Binoche is new - teacher - in - town Dina Delsanto, an acclaimed artist battling rheumatoid arthritis, while Owen's Jack Marcus is the popular (with the students at least) English teacher with a drinking problem and a passion for language. In the battle of the sexes, the latest independent film, Words and Pictures, takes on this dispute in telling its love story about an English professor and an artist, both of whom have conflicting viewpoints on the subject and their budding courtship. She values imagery and art; he treasures words and literature - their clash fires up their students' imaginations, even as they bicker and spar their way into an evident mutual attraction. Owen and Binoche are pitch perfect in their roles while the supporting cast of Bruce Davison, Amy Brenneman, and well - selected teenage actors are charming, too. The chemistry between Owen and Binoche is terrific and, despite the somewhat cantankerous personalities of their characters, these are two teachers that any school would be lucky to have."
8267,"Such a beautiful and artful film, everything about the way this movie looks is delivered perfectly. It's gorgeously shot in widescreen, with director Alexandre Aja filling the frame with lots of detail. There are some truly hilarious and insane scenes. It's not without flaws but it is pretty original and not pretentious, which is a rarity these days. There is some good gore and makeup effects by the prolific Gregory Nicotero and Howard Berger, as well as a plethora of snake imagery and a genuinely memorable finale."
8235,"You may not have too many turns and twists in this, so you'll be able to fairly see the direction this is going. The central scenario that Edgerton and Saville create is an intriguing one and a ripe potential idea and it's clear that the idea was developed first and the strands that follow afterwards and the film just can't keep up its beginning pace that sees some smart scripting and direction take place. Starting out in a hugely promising fashion, Felony looks likely to be one of those searing Australian dramas in the vein of Animal Kingdom or even Saville's own under - seen gem Noise, yet quickly descends into a procession of seen before events that culminate in a fairly unimpressive ending. It's pretty much a morality play, one that is very well mounted by the makers. A tightly wound crime drama that oozes class, this Sydney - set motion picture follows on from These Final Hours and Predestination to continue the stellar run for Australian movies in 2014."
8237,"Even if they're embellishing in lies, the situations themselves and especially the delivery are still amusing. For the first hour, it's brilliantly entertaining, earning belly laughs for the absurdity of the anecdotes. John Wojtowicz is an even more interesting person than his character in Dog Day Afternoon. Wojtowicz is affable and funny, completely un self - conscious about his rather insane life, his voracious, intense and sometimes confusing sexual and romantic appetites, his love of the spotlight. While Dog Day Afternoon is a microcosm of these types of farcical events that happen in America, this documentary emphasises the man against the system aspect, and for a fan of Sidney Lumet's films, there's great real life footage of the fateful event that puts it into perspective."
8245,"It had all the qualities to do so and be good. AJ Bowen is a good actor when he's doing homages to eighties horror or even playing an asshole; he doesn't have the weight needed to pull his role off. One second everything is cool, the next it's shot to hell. In telling the story of Jonestown, nothing would have been needed other than to have just told the story as it unfolded without the addition of this added layer of "" reality ""--and it would have been a much more superior film."
8298,"The characters are genuine and believable. The cast is uniformly superb, with the three lead actors truly shining in a very believable way. This film shows Riemelt with his best look yet. The Sexual scenes are very well shot and far from seedy. In many ways is like a 40's melodrama."
8321,"Everything is captured and the images are pristine. The sounds, staging, understated effects, locations and direction are superb. The character interactions are believable and well developed. The production team really planned these aspects very well. If you have a good pair of headphones, all the better."
8401,"And one of them was, and it has a lot of very sexy, erotic scenes, but it's also a pretty good story underneath. Maybe he is so similar to and comfortable in his characters skin. He was very obsessed to' Go' as he obsessed with online cam and blog. It's nothing incredibly original, but the two leads have an undeniable chemistry and the writing and dialogue is mostly on point. It seemed so spontaneous and natural that either those two boys are extraordinary actors or the writing is excellent or all of the above."
8424,""" The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby: Her "" is great because Jessica Chastain is brilliant in portraying a woman tormented by loss. + Chastain's range + Tackling different and difficult concepts + Beautiful to look at - Very dark 7. Sprinkled with introspective insights and anchored by terrific performances, it's truly bolstered through its enigma. Continuing on from the frustration experienced in the saga's Him component, Her struggles to engage the audience in a meaningful way despite it featuring an assured Jessica Chastain performance and a few genuine moments of emotional power centred around loss and regret. With some nice turns by McAvoy and Chastain, these films remain watchable but never reach the heights they so easily could've had the hard slog journey been worth it in the final payoff."
7131,"The implacable fathering voice of Vittorio Matteucci certainly brings the needed authority in Virgil as Dante's guide, protector and teacher about life. This animation is really enjoyable as an adult or teenager who either have never read the book or has already."
7936,"It had so many wonderful qualities. The scenes are a visual feast. All these things are delivered so well by DiCaprio. It was deliciously excessive and exaggerated, as expected from a Baz Luhrmann production. DeCaprio's Gatsby is forceful, decisive; he is a determined man of significant accomplishment and great ability."
8243,"The fact that this is true really gives everything more of an edge and sucks you in deeper to the movie. The only good thing about this movie is that luckily it is only 90 minutes long. The action scenes look nice with the touch of hand - carried camera angle emphasizing the panic in them. Revenge of the Green Dragons marks the English language debut of Hong Kong's most highly respected director, Wai - keung Lau. 5/5 stars Andrew Lau's "" Infernal Affairs "" trilogy became the best - known import in the early 2000s from the storied Hong Kong film industry, supplying Martin Scorsese with material for his Academy Award - winning film "" The Departed ""."
8244,"Some parts were taken too far but it had a good amount of clean humor and a little crude humor as well. First of all, the jokes feel like timeless jokes, as to say that they didn't rely on modern day or pop culture things that could be dated in a few years. Funny and a good story, Let's be Cops is a peek inside the police world. When they intercept real police uniforms, they act like real cops, then get involved in a high - profile drug case. There's actually a good buddy cop theme here, it's hilarious to see them test the limits of their new cop powers, the antagonists are really threatening."
8419,"1) - 40 somethings getting older reaching an inflection point in their lives. To be honest the film is enjoyable on its own terms. It has laughs and is occasionally strangely moving. It plays very well at first, as Jamie reveals himself to be - just like Josh - a documentarian, and one who - unlike Josh - seems to have everything work out perfectly at every step of the filmmaking process. When you are above 35 you kinda look forward to seeing something that might challenge the way everything has already been presented to you repeatedly."
8184,"Mark Ruffalo's passion jumps right out of the screen at you, and in both its most angry and its most devastating, you're right there with him. Bomer was good as Felix, Julia Roberts was GREAT as a doctor who is handicapped and very frank and Taylor Kitsch was good as Bruce Niles. The film is well - acted particularly by Mark Ruffalo, Matt Bomer, Alfred Molina and Julia Roberts. Performances from Ruffalo, Julia Roberts, Alfred Molina, Matt Bomer, Jim Parsons and the entire cast are superlative. The film contains some nudity and some suggestive innuendos, but they all seem important to the story and are not just placed in the film for effect."
8246,"Some of the segments are entertaining. Like the first Sin City 9 years ago, this new Sin City is B - movie bliss. Everything is a CGI-fest these days, and this story, with a fantastic setting and extraordinary physics pulls it off nicely. it is bloody, violent, beautifully made, with cool deep voices, nudity and clearly fitting into the film noir genre. Both Joseph Gordon - Levitt and Powers Boothe have amazing screen presence and as they're pitted against one another throughout the night the stakes keep getting higher and higher, with satisfying results."
8102,"For the rest, the production values are pretty high, the special effects are competent and the cast is composed in a big part by attractive multi-cultural young people who seem taken from a catalogue of Urban Outfitters (what a luck for the post - apocalyptic world). She is well accompanied by a good support cast to be with her in the three entries, such as: Ray Stevenson, Ansel Elgort, Miles Teller, Zoe Kravitz, Jay Courtney, Mekhi Phifer, Maggie Q, Ben Lloyd Hughes, and Kate Winslet. However, Shailene gave an excellent portrayal of how she developed from a shy dependent girl to a confident fearless warrior. Thrilling first installment of a successful trilogy, dealing with a stirring dystopian Sci - Fi in which a beautiful and intelligent adolescent becomes involved into lots of dangers, risks, emotion and violence. If the story had been ingenious enough to justify so many conditions and unearthly circumstances, there wouldn't have been any problem."
8300,"This immersive, unflinching approach allows you to become invested in the performances. This is also partly thanks to Academy Award winning DP Robert Elswit, who can frame a scene to tension and success. Even those scenes though, may have subverted your expectations. However, with Inherent Vice, Anderson applies some of his hallmarks in new and interesting ways. He crafts provocative and engaging players that fully mesmerize you for its duration."
8425,"There are so many good things and moments in this film. The guy who plays Seiger is unbelievably good. Young actors Gijs Blom and Ko Zandvliet are brilliant. The acting in "" Jongens "" is amazingly natural and believable. Huge compliments to the makers for such a fantastically realistic portrayal of gay teenagers."
8247,"But as others have noted rushes towards the finish line (which is a good thing). There are few good scares along the way and the mentioned ending is really good The visual aspects of this movie are very memorable, as is the performance from its lead, Rupert Evans and, combined with a simple but compelling story, the film as a whole is very effective. The characters and smart and savvy in trying discern reality from imagination, or worse, supernatural occurrences. In contrast to majority of horror flicks that have grainy filter, The Canal looks very quaint."
8427,"Backcountry is a good example how one simple premise can still be thrilling with clever production and a few grisly scenes. This is a really atmospheric movie, with likeable characters and a fair amount of suspense. The acting is all really good as are the production values. The main characters were believable and the acting was very good. Backcountry provides a survival tale in its natural form."
8248,"Like the rest of the Dardenne's body of work, it is powered by a resolute faith in humanity. "" and the timely understated and noteworthy acting performance by French actress and singer Marion Cotillard. By the time Sandra returns to work and knows what happened, majority of her co-workers had opted for the bonus. Two Days, One Night is set against the backdrop of an industrial town in LiÃ¨ge, Belgium. Jean - Pierre and Luc Dardenne's latest working - class odyssey, Two Days, One Night, takes place over the course of a weekend."
8155,"Some of the backdrop scenes of various cities and stadiums just takes your breath away, very much suited for the big screen, a must see in the theater. Overall, if you liked Moneyball you will love this one. Costner is a perfect choice and there is just something about him and sports movies that is perfect. Overall, Draft Day takes full advantage of telling an engaging behind - the - scenes tale using the world's most popular league as a vehicle. His calls to and from potential and existing players had an authentic feel and the chaos of draft day is captured with tense complexity and legacy importance."
8150,"This works to a point and it is a pretty good looking film with some particularly memorable scenes. There are some good performances, the best of which coming from Russell Crowe, who plays with real steel and a powerful charisma. Clint Mansell's music score swells thrillingly and has an epic sweep, enhancing crucial scenes and not drowning stuff out. Still, he acts on his best suspicions--or intends to act. Without giving anything away, there were some parts of this film that called for a more dramatic narrative."
8148,"The acting as expected from Scarlett Johansson, Chris Evans and Samuel L. Jackson was excellent. BTW stay for the end credits for an extra bonus! They do infuse their own style of comedy with fun references and a cameo other than Stan Lee, functioning properly within the confines of the tone and story. There is plenty of plot, intelligence and sweet characters moments to keep anyone satisfying. The characters all had their own amazing moments and the acting is decent as well."
8250,"Audiences have gotten good at predicting when these moments happen. All the usual plot devices and tropes that come along with the genre are here - it's just executed with finesse. That being said, lower your expectations and you might like it. It has the chills, it has the thrills, and the added bonuses of good acting and an excellent premise. The found - footage genre has been on life support for a while now but this one had a cool premise in a great setting - the catacombs."
8433,"Christian Petzold's glorious war drama, "" Phoenix "", falls firmly into the first category. He's an interesting actor, a mix between Benicio del Toro and the young Orson Welles. In this respect the film portrays two opposing views very powerfully. Their scenes together have a realistic, tangible suspense. It's a good movie with a very strong performance by Hoss, a decent effort from Zehrfeld and good work by the talented supporting players who you may only know if you're really interested in German cinema, although they have won several awards already here."
8251,"If Duplass is great, Moss adds that extra dimension that makes her work here nothing short of outstanding. Pros: - Two incredible central performances from Mark Duplass and Elisabeth Moss. Rich writing and solid delivery can satisfy you on several levels. There was no convolution, there were no red herrings, the story progressed at a good pace and there were no over the top acting moments. Endlessly intriguing with some superb writing and directing, and two absolutely fantastic leading performances."
8252,"It's dramatic, it's funny, it's intense, and it gets pretty frightening at times. The Guest is the perfect advert for his abilities. If you remember him from Downtown Abbey, his performance here is amazing! The first two acts are impeccable as well, building up the tension and suspense to a level of tangibility that you can cut with a knife. Action sequences are well choreographed, it has both devastating and ridiculous impact."
8253,"The dialogues are really good, well though - out, and delivered convincingly by a stellar cast, who are always believable in their roles. Jessie Cave, Ben Schnetzer, Sophie Evans, George Mackay and Freddie Fox all perform keenly and will have done their rising stars no harm here. Whilst levels of both expectation and acceptance are higher today, it is still a hard conversation to have The actors' performances were all amazing and flawless, from tears to dance sequences. Anyway, worth the price of admission (unlike, unfortunately, so many movies these days . )"
8254,"Both put in very strong performances in roles that require a fair bit of range. They seem so perfect for each other, so it becomes that much more suspenseful as things start to go wrong. It underplays the horror side of things and slowly builds thing up layer by layer. Music is superb, the atmosphere from the moment they reach the cabin is brilliant - all in all, a tremendous surprise, great performances and a first - time director with a distinctive voice and real vision. The acting is by far this movies strong point."
8438,"Omar Sy exploded on the scene in The Intouchables and again proves what a tremendous screen presence he has. The scenes between Sy and Rahim showcase a fun pairing, particularly during a sequence on a rooftop. And also like in "" Les intouchables "" the music makes a perfect match with the story and the images. Some of the film's episodes are light and occasionally funny. At the same time Samba is so entertaining and comical with lots of great scenes, but also educative and touching."
8255,"The actors are stellar all around the board, made up of Wigg, Hader, Luke Wilson and Ty Burrel, this cast is utterly fantastic. The chemistry between Wiig and Hader is incredible, and Wilson is a joy to behold. The story, while dark and dreary, still manages to score some great laughs. The laughs are quick, but they are consistently overtaken by the somber sequences that follow them. The script, co-written by director Craig Johnson and Mark Heyman, really does capture some poignant and dramatic moments, and certainly benefits from the extremely talented cast."
8440,"How Ellis turned himself around, gave back, and positively affected so many people's lives is also quite touching. He was a great ballplayer, and once he sobered up he became a greater human being. Steve Blass and Bruce Kison provide a contrast to the words of Dave Cash, Mudcat Grant and Al Oliver, but the most insight comes from Ellis' friends and family. He was charismatic and outspoken to the point of being proclaimed by some as "" baseball's Muhammed Ali "", and got a touching letter from Jackie Robinson encouraging him despite a torrent of racist threats. Great interviews, a great '70s soundtrack and some good inspiration make this doc."
8145,"Basic plot round - up : 9 years after the events of the series, Veronica has moved to New York City and is finished law school, having run from Neptune after her first year of college. Even after nine years, one phone call from Logan Echolls is all it took; after all, their love is epic. The movie is definitely just for those that really missed the characters and just needed a fresh 107 minutes of Veronica. How to tie two threads together, over such a huge jump in time, how to craft a plot that accounted for things like the season four trailer, and how to make it all feel seamless. The dialogue of Veronica Mars was always one of its highlights, and it was a happy homecoming."
8257,"The wall is still reachable, they have plenty of trees, knifes, axe, rope etc. . Indeed, The Maze Runner is such a cool, confident and thrilling blend of action beats and character work that it's hard to believe Ball has never before commandeered a full - length feature film. They've been there between 3 years and present day and must make it through a hefty and unexplainably moving maze to get back to where they don't remember they've come from. But it's easy to see why Wes Ball got the job - with this one film, he graduates from short films to blockbuster movies with flair to spare. PM: In the middle of desert sir, where the working temperatures are infernal, roads and rails are blocked, and transportation costs are high."
8258,"These activists--who became known as the Camden 28--fought the case in court and won! Funny thing though, nothing has changed in 50 years. The raid on the FBI office was successful, and the activists took thousands of documents. The film blends archival footage with reenactment seamlessly, and delivers the blow - by - blow story of the break - in very well, although as an IMDb goof notes the dramatic device of the apartment manager watching television is anachronistic. Shortly after the Media break - in, a larger group of antiwar activists broke into a draft board office in Camden, New Jersey, and began to destroy files."
8259,"With characters that are fun to watch and briefly partake in their lives. There are some interesting directing choices by Lynn Shelton, including having the film start out with a flashback and then cutting to ten years later. Megan Birch (Keira Knightley) is a woman in her late 20s who suddenly has an epiphany that catalyzes a string of events that help her contextualize her life journey. Chloe Grace Moretz is a standout as always. There's actually quite a lot to enjoy in Laggies, even if its ending is a foregone conclusion."
8260,"Things change when a few years pass and Kat returns home from college. As far as the thriller goes, well even less there going on honestly, there's not many scenes of suspense here to be found. There are some great looking scenes during Kat's dream sequences, but there isn't much more going on story wise. Essentially, a lot of Araki's films are about getting out of the comfort zone. Overall, a great movie that is hurt a little by the amazingness of Gone Girl being released the week before."
8262,"Everything kids and many adults who accompany them or with others in the age group will enjoy. For those that have seen creator Laika's other works - Coraline and Paranorman - you will enjoy this very much. They are also industrious and like all kinds of gadgets. But at the same time the good guys aren't wearing the white hats. It isn't that' The Boxtrolls' is underwhelming though; against a surfeit of clean - cut CG animation, its stop - motion aesthetics make it a refreshing change of look."
8263,"It's particularly intriguing that Quinn isn't written off simply as a degenerate whore, but someone whose mistakes - though inexcusable - are rooted in as much heartbreak and sadness as she's causing Judd with her infidelity. What keeps the film's servings of tragedy and comedy from tipping into farce are its endearingly real characters. The seemingly talented cast seem to go through the motions, speaking contrived lines and relying on set piece comedic elements that are not funny to begin with, a rabbi called "" boner "" and Jane Fonda's fake breasts are as good as they get. Amazing performances, sharply written and wildly funny, this film will pull tears, smiles and laughs. Fonda is luminous, carrying off the comedy - and her prosthetic breasts - with remarkable grace, while creating a picture of a tough, sexually progressive woman with plenty of depth and love for her children."
8264,"It truly is unbelievable that the Indonesian government and paramilitary are still alive and well today, and are still in power, where these murderers walk free with no remorse. This film is immensely important and the whole world needs to know and make the governments involved take action and own up to the truth. These murderers are still alive today and are considered heroes by the government, but are still feared by the common folk. They were spun lies about the communists and many took joy in killing them. With just two films to his name, both about the Indonesian mass - murders of the mid-1960's Oppenheimer has become the most important documentarian of his generation."
8448,"Normally anything with Samuel Jackson, is an immediate thumbs up. The ending even holds some surprises, and there are a number of memorable scenes. Even the presence of powerhouse Samuel L. couldn't elevate this atrocity from theatrical hell. 20 - 30 years ago this would have been a great film, bordering on academy award winning material. There is a twist that many viewers will probably spot in advance but thankfully it is neither too obvious nor is it too unlikely."
8265,"When it comes to true story films, there are times where film - makers try to add more or less into what really happened in the event being told. When a movie comes to an end and the credits start rolling, everyone typically gets up and leaves right? American Sniper (2014) **** (out of 4) Thrilling, tense and dramatic telling of Chris Kyle's (Bradley Cooper) rise from a cowboy without much direction in his life to becoming the deadliest sniper in U. S. history. This film here could have been clichÃ©d in so many ways but thankfully a director with such masterful direction can take a familiar story like war and its impact on someone and make it feel fresh, tight and original. If you had liked The Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty and Machine Gun Preacher (not a war film but somewhat similar to Kyle's story) you will enjoy this."
8450,"For example, borderlines are often very good at feigning normalcy. Some underlying dynamics and truths about BPD were spot - on, however, and Kristin Wiig was awesome as always. The movie may not make a coherent whole, but the pieces are pretty good in themselves. Meanwhile, the intriguing premise never quite gels. The whole cast is brilliant really, with the obvious highlight being Kristen Wiig absolutely embodying this character to a tee."
8266,"This film is filled with these fascinating changes of tones. It's got good (some great) performances, awesomely disturbing makeup FX, and Smith's unique style of writing running through it. He's a typical product of the modern age â€“ a podcaster with ideas way above his station. Thirty minutes later, the main character has some intellectual dialogues and proves that he is not as dumb as one might have thought. This movie has more memorable scenes than ten others together."
8268,"Some funny moments, and an (expected and expectable) heart - warming ending. Analeigh Tipton is just delicious to look at and Miles Miller comes across as a thoroughly nice chap. However, the recommendation in this case is for you to see two talents, who will soon find themselves in roles with more potential and possible accolades to affirm that, tackle material, as of now, rarely committed to film. Megan (Analeigh Tipton) is a beautiful young woman troubled by her own singularity. Sex is not an uncommon thing to see in films anymore; the discussion of sex, romance, love, and marriage from the perspective of the people who most often engage in it - teenagers and young adults - are a bit harder to find."
8270,"They've went on to use actual names for people and places, that some may think some things are actually true. The movie does show this in a few scenes but in a interesting if somewhat brief way. A good fantasy action movie with great visual effects, good acting and a decent story. This movie has a dramatic and full of action story, disclosed through great screenplay, special effects and music score. Of course, this is not the best actioneer of the year, but it's very well done one."
8271,"Stunts, Effects, Makeup & Camera - Work: Top - shelf. It gives extra layers to this character and makes him all the more enjoyable as the lead. Probably one of the directors best movies, if not the best. The cast were all first class & the cameo performances were a great part of the film. There are a couple of truly amazing cameos in the film which are both perfect and hilarious."
8458,"The humanity of everyone involved was awesome. Keep up the great work SWC. As others have said, surprisingly good movie. Excellent character creation, simple but thought provoking concepts. Sean William Scott is perfectly cast, and other casting choices were also spot - on."
8272,"Nothing award worthy or anything, but the cast did "" good "". Sorry all you haters but it deserves better than a 5/10 score. It is not the first time a low rated movie turns out to be great, but it is certainly the greatest contrast between reviews and the actual movie. It's Egoyan at his best. Because it doesn't fit normal expectations of narrative, and because the characters are not typical characters, first level viewers may find it a challenge - or, may find it informing their appreciation of film."
8273,"The direction was clean and solid, the cinematography was immaculate, and the special and visual effects were outstanding. Everything about the look of the film was perfect. But it delivers so many genres on any level you care to enjoy it. The cast performances are what really make this movie' shine'. Rising actress Sarah Snook with a stellar performance is backed by solid performances of both Hawke and Taylor."
8274,"But of course, the biggest strength of the movie is, that it delivers laughs on a very consistent level. It is laugh - out - loud (LOL, young people) funny for extended periods. The jokes where brilliant and more importantly, they were frequent and consistently brilliant. The comedy is great, the deadpan nature of it is hilarious, the jokes are brilliant. If you like mockumentaries, dark comedy, vampires, or are just generally into humor, definitely go see this one."
8276,"As well as confront the ghosts of their past from their youth. , abusive, sickos really deserving of the title "" white trash "" - brings this film to life. Good romantic films are almost as rare as good comedies. Like most Nicholas Sparks movies, it will only appeal to certain crowds. While it did feature some major differences in the last act, it worked well."
8277,"Non stop action, all scenes look very realistic. To this contributes some stunning, fast - and - furious level action scenes that benefit amazingly by the practicality involved. Adrianne Palicki, Willem Dafoe, Ian McShane and Dean Winters round out a strong supporting cast. And he was perfect in here and the fight scenes with Keanu Reeves were well done by him. He is surrounded by a great cast too that has very fun moments on their own."
8278,"Camera direction is competent, there are very beautiful shots, and the few action scenes are not bad. Alfie Allen who plays Yatesey is a bright spot. Tried to ends like with a climax a FastFive6, by giving someone a handsome amount. Well the movie will win no Oscars; but it was entertaining cute! Fordy is the co-founder of the enterprise and is a genius when it comes to computers and hacking someones mailbox."
8279,"Vincent D'Onofrio, Jeremy Strong, Dax Shepherd, and Billy Bob Thorton are all really great. Another excellent performance by Robert Downey Jr.! The film is beautifully directed by David Dobkin. Their scenes are strong and emotional. The story works and you're invested from the get go."
8280,"Molina and Lithgow give sterling performances as the leads and they do start to create some moments of genuine emotion. The director does a perfect job in balancing the emotions. Sach's direction is sensitive and subtle, but it is the strong performances of Lithgow and Molina that give the film its sense of heart. They have decent chemistry together and they don't seem uncomfortable in scenes that call for them to show affection. The scenes with Lithgow together with Molina work best, when separated everything feels contrived redundant and boring."
8281,"Fury is a gritty film, with great productions values, really period vehicles, settings and costume. This film has pretensions of being a serious movie and the cinematography / soundtrack etc. are very well done, but the whole thing just lacks any reality or validity. Watch LaBoeuf's nervous leg, and a list of other endearing nuanced details; He plays a very convincing religious proselytizer. Besides doing it the right way destroys the tank in fifteen minutes and turns a heroic stand into the suicidal idiotic idea it is in the last month of the war."
8282,"The story is straightforward and although it moves along slowly at times (fast paced at others), it's quite intense and is generally beautifully shot. Mads Mikkelsen has proved himself worthy of leading roles even in (his not native tongue) English. 22 years after "" The Unforgiven "", a new classic has arrived on screens. The visual style is superb, and director Levring uses every trick in the book. And just when you think you've seen it all, Levring surprises with a beautiful and, in a way, revealing end shot."
8283,"In truth, St. Vincent owes so much of its success to a small blessing known as Mr. Murray. St. Vincent is an entertaining film with a well - worn message, but Bill Murray, in his finest role since Lost in Translation, transforms it into holiness. Instead, she excels in a scene with an emotional dump on Oliver's principal and teacher (a standout Chris O'Dowd). A real good feel movie that shows how saints are everywhere, everyday, check out St. Vincent. Vincent's the man - child, a boy who never grew up, a loner who survives from day to day and Murray nails his character."
8284,"Certainly all the Hollywood - related scenes have a truly authentic feel to them. But The Rewrite subverts expectations by being, well, really rather good. but please stick till the credits, you'll enjoy it. He gets exceptional support here from such screen notables as Marisa Tomei, J. K. Simmons, Allison Janney, and Chris Elliott. Clearly the stars here read the script and thought it delightful."
8285,"If you want to see a horror movie about an Ouija Board, watch Witchboard 1 - 3. "" Ouija "" has a pretty cool and creepy story to work with, an old spirit board discovered in the attack, suicides and haunting, a creepy legend that connects the board to the house of the suicide girl, it is all perfect horror subject matter. It's a modern horror movie based on a board game - was anyone optimistic about this? The cast give well enough performances of these haunted characters. The 2016 prequel is leaps and bounds better than this movie."
8471,"Sure, against the great films of the last century this doesn't need to be mentioned, but against light, comedic summer flicks, it is absolutely palatable. It's a lighthearted movie with lots of laughs that will leave you feeling good. time to try out for the CIA - you really have a wonderful way with accents, just as an alternative ;) It was a really nice light hearted movie. Austin Pendleton & George Morfogen are in fine form, as well. The series of events she witnesses in this eccentric comedy, is often hilarious."
8286,"Nightcrawler works on so many levels. See it if you enjoy thrillers. Jake Gyllenhaal is utterly fantastic in this film. The writing and direction is fantastic, which is especially impressive as it's the directorial debut by Dan Gilroy who takes on both duties. Suspense is the main key to this film's success, it build and builds to the point where the last twenty minutes of the film are completely unpredictable."
8287,"but they all become great as serious characters. Visual effects are stunning, so u will experience another Disney master piece. Fun for all ages, and friendly as well. and you have to love how honey lemon says "" hiro "" obviously, there are some issues. The Villain by far is one of the best villains in recent Disney history, he doesn't sing, dance or monologue, he simply gets the job done."
8166,"It's just effortless - the hand gestures, the facial expression. It was perfect: no violence, no horror, no big special effects, and nothing upsetting. It has a genuine plot line which is followed through - a comedy with substance - it's not just one funny scenario after another and this emphasises the hilarity of the funny moments that do come up. Its a total chick flick with comedy through out the whole thing it is such a fun movie to watch with anyone. The Other Woman is a 2014 American romantic comedy film directed by Nick Cassavetes and written by Melissa Stack."
8289,"Settings are simple but effective and the atmosphere is well held together by the staging and the clean production. Time Lapse is 104 minutes of suspenseful and thrilling entertainment. What makes the film good, far out weighs any minor short comings. As the film is set in one location it really requires strong performances from the cast and thankfully all three leads excellent as are all the supporting cast. The windup is complete and clean, revelations during the body of the film become evidence that tickle with satisfaction as it ends."
8475,"The film also features superbly recreated' old footage' (cinematography by Robert D. Yeoman) showing Beach Boy TV slots and video productions. It's these moments that show the film was made by fans with an attention for detail. com and enter your email address to receive future reviews. His slide into near insanity is brilliantly reflected in an audio soundscape that merges snatched Beach Boy fragments and natural sounds into a cacophony. Director Bill Pohlad does a marvelous job of illustrating the parallels between each on screen version of Brian Wilson, and both actors give brilliant, emotional performances."
8200,"With no short of brilliance, the entire cast ignites some of their finest and most compelling works of their careers. Everything seemed to finally click for actress Mia Wasikowska in her most daring performance to date. While Mia Wasikowska plays one of the more memorable characters of the year. Lots of industry - talk (yes, they really do talk that way) and all the stress, the pushing for success, the attention needed at all cost and the eagerness to do anything it takes to get there are greatly told. But the Weiss family in Maps To The Stars are a really outstanding collection of freaks and weirdos."
8163,"The story hangs together well, with strong central performances which keep you engaged. However, for its audacity to advertise brilliance and be anything but, it gets a 1. So let's start with the film itself, as a scifi thriller, it's beautifully executed with some stunning visuals, to the extent that sometimes it has the feel of a travel advertisement. An airtight script that rises up to the challenge was all that was needed to make Transcendence truly, um, transcendent. Pfister's direction is expedient, and he avoids the jumpy camera syndrome that typically plagues these kinds of movies."
8293,"Ann Dowd as the Kitteridge's friend Bonnie Newton shines as what one might think a genuine Downeasterner. Richard Jenkins as Olive's husband Henry Kitteridge is spot on. It's so wonderfully crafted, in all aspects. Some of the bit parts are charming. If you liked McDormand's performance in Fargo, Olive Kitteridge will surely not disappoint."
8294,"Seated firmly in the center are a trio of dazzling performances from Channing Tatum, Steve Carell, and Mark Ruffalo, all of which make a compelling case for their career best works. Like all great films with great performances, its element of truth is plainly apparent. All three performances are a study in the art of subtly. It gives Tatum and Carell some of the best artistic environments of their careers for them to play around in. He built scenes at a gradual pace, but each scene has a path and reach a distinctive point of impact."
8144,"Evan Rachael was flawless in her portrayal with some great support by Scott. The direction was top notch and it looked like the director knew what he wanted from his actors. But it also means you feel things on a different level, you probably enjoy things more than others, since you are more connected to things and letting them in. Its very different than your average Rom - com but does fall prey at some areas to the regular formula film making. The colors are warm and the tempo is upbeat but slows down for some nicely done heart - to - heart scenes."
8111,"Two hundred years later, Adam returns and finds a modern society. Many decent action and' dramatic' scenes are squeezed into the brief runtime of 1 hour 32 minutes. Miranda Otto, she who was Eowyn, is suitably regal as Gargoyle queen Leonore and brings the necessary gravitas required. With so many great things in theatres right now, don't waste your time on this. As for Otto and Strahovski, both actresses are competent but largely colourless in their roles."
8295,"If you love unique films with plot twists, you'll like "" Stonehearst Asylum! "" Ben Kingsley imparticular brings so much to his character. "" Stonehearst Asylum "" is an insane, Gothic thriller with a lot of chills, thrills, and fun to be had along the way. Anderson clearly takes delight in all the proceedings, which is one of the reasons the film feels fresh. In general an entertaining film about lunatics and an asylum, set in a Gothic era, the cast really do bring a lot to this film."
8296,"It will work well on DVD. Both Meester and Jacobs have endearing qualities. All six stars go to the performances of the leads. It's a feel - good movie that does not pretend anything else and that's the reason why it works. The chemistry between the actors works, and both of the leads make their characters fascinating enough."
8297,"The acting is actually pretty good, and there are even some very interesting characters that you can tell are having good fun with their parts. His portrayal of King and the many emotions he goes through is believable. The special effects are superb and the pentagram carving is disturbing. Shane Johnson did a solid job as the titular character, whoever played the wife did a great job although her scenes were obviously limited, the little girl was very good. But quite the contrary, the main character acting is believable, visual effects though scarce are well made and add to the scariness of some scenes, and it's overall a refreshing horror flick that makes good use (but doesn't abuse) of the "" found footage "" format that is so popular in horror movies these days."
8113,"Two, the performances by both Sam and Olivia were convincing and enjoyable, especially Sam. Consider Rockwell in Moon, or Monaghan in True Detective, two very strong performances. The illicit affair instills a newfound confidence in Doug, and much like Kevin Spacey in American Beauty, he begins to rebel against everything and everyone that has been holding him back all these years. It takes a while to build some steam, but there are bright spots. Ray Liotta is a plus and Ron Heneghan is excellent as the police officer."
8117,"In bringing together elements from Inglourious Basterds, Ocean's Eleven and Museum Hours, George Clooney certainly had plenty of opportunity for a rich and interesting story. It's an "" Oceans 11 "" team of art curators, historians and architects sent into France and Germany. It's amazingly obvious that in neither of these capacities does Clooney know what he is doing. The truth is, The Monuments Men could be, and really should be much more entertaining than it is. There are seemingly continuous laughs coming from quick one liners and witty character interactions, which keeps the audience somewhat engaged, although with such bleak subject matter, it's debatable that a movie dealing with the eradication of an entire culture's achievements should be as lighthearted as it is."
8603,"The first few scenes were quite good, obviously imitating the cool atmosphere of films by Tarantino and Rodriguez. There is a lot going on and a lot of layers to the plot. Seeing JCVD do his "" actual acting "" thing is also fairly enjoyable. JCVD plays an interesting role in this film and he brilliantly mixes in with the rest of the cast giving his contribution to the story. The cast is great but a special mention goes to Alfred Molina, Grant Bowler and Academy - Award - nominee Catalina Sandino Moreno who deliver amazing performances."
8181,"Papa and iDubbbz really did a good job with this one. Jon Favreau's pet project, after a decade of big budget, heavy - on - special - effects, blockbusters and fantasy fair, is as charming as they come. While the film is certainly a feast for the senses, at its core it's about restoration: restoring the father - son relationship, and restoring passion. CHEF, directed by and starring Jon Favreau, was a delightful little indie "" dish "" and an immensely satisfying treat. Special mention must be made of Emjay Anthony, who plays Favreau's son Percy with the perfect blend of maturity and innocence, and is really the emotional centre of the film."
8301,"It's a fitting continuation of Katniss' journey, but - and that is the one serious downside to this film - it doesn't lead that journey to its logical conclusion. Title (Brazil): "" Jogos Vorazes: A EsperanÃ§a - Parte 1 "" ("" Hunger Games: The Hope - Part 1 "" ) Jennifer Lawrence still shines as Katniss Everdeen. Likewise, the final chapter in the series (Mockingjay: Part 2) will likely suffer from having to do without all the dramatic build - up that Part 1 offers. This felt very much like they were stretching it out so they could make two movies - which is the new thing to do in Hollywood with these franchises."
8302,"( Try It) Best Part: Haley Joel Osment shines. The best aspect of the film is Haley Joel Osment's character. The rest of the cast is fine as well, even in the small parts. Lorenza gives a solid performance which is only here for her looks. The kids were great, Hayley Joel Osmant was great, the supporting adults were great, just a great movie."
8303,"Christian's Moses blazes with self confidence. Other than spectacular visuals and 3 - D, they don't seem to care enough about anything else. While the performances were good, the casting was way off. Every moment of "" The Ten Commandments "" is so captivating with top quality story, scripts, acting, directing, sets, costumes, visual effects, and music that time really flies by when watching it. But there is everything missing in Exodus that made Gladiator a hit."
8143,"This adds an extra layer of tension that's sorely missing from the Fast and Furious series (to which Need for Speed is destined to be compared), and the film's best moments come courtesy of E-brake drifts, squealing tires, and near collisions. The entire movie flip flops between emotional scenes (which are anything but) and action scenes. Despite its paper - thin plot and many, many failed attempts at humor, Need for Speed still works thanks to the generous amount of high - octane action sequences, and the undeniable charisma of Aaron Paul. The racing movies have definitely been overused as of late, but Need for Speed is still an enjoyable experience even though it does not really add much to the racing film genre. Need for Speed is one of the better attempts at translating a popular video game into a big screen experience, with the practical stunts and real - world action serving as a nice counterbalance to Fast and Furious's ever - increasing ridiculousness."
8305,"But on the other hand everyone really did their best to make this feel like a Dumb and Dumber film. Unlike the god - awful prequel this film really feels like Dumb and Dumber and it's actually fun to see some scenes re-created, but with a new little twist, or characters from the original film returning. But one or two laughs in a 100 - minute movie just isn't enough. The trouble with comedy sequels (and comedy series too) is that once a certain kind of laugh is achieved, they feel the need to push the envelope to get another laugh. Then in the edit room, everyone figured, "" Well they shot it how they want it . """
8306,"It is better than it will score on places like 1Mbd. Throughout the plot are moments of blissful dialogue intertwined with pauses, telling looks, and, it has to be said, the incongruous, but it does hang together if you stick with it. Watch it only without prejudice, and you will enjoy Katie Holmes acting, and Miss Meadows' clothing and hairstyles. Katie Holmes stars as Miss Meadows, who seems to bring the 1950's back with saddle shoes, tap dancing, classic cars, classic dress, & classic values. Miss Meadows' clothes, combined with her hairstyles and maybe the makeup, are the things that make this movie so enjoyable."
8500,"Creep is a disturbing nightmare of a film that takes twists that may feel familiar, but remains creative and is a refreshing take on the found footage genre. Thankfully, for a film that always feels like it's building up to something, the resolution is well - judged and perfectly executed. "" Creep "" excels by shifting gears from hilarious, to sad, to scary, to sometimes all of that at the same time. Another thing this movie does very well, it manages to maintain its mysterious and surreal feel, but at the same time actually delivers laughs. Brice and Duplass are able to funnel the mumblecore's priority of character development and use of a more natural dialogue, or in this case, a very naturally unnerving dialogue, into the staples of a Jason Blum (Paranormal Activity) produced horror film."
8307,"The filmmakers must have said ,' let's bring in comments on' the weave'. One critic even wrote, "" A smart, hilarious satire of the Obama age . "" Well funded and full of passion, it simply shows whites as the worst people, ever. Instead of putting up a highly - specialized / strawman definition, only to pretend that it's THE definition. Seriously, people need to check themselves and get backbones for calling this funny, smart, or witty."
8501,"It's so embarrassing to watch something like this. It's definitely has its laugh out loud moments. Seriously it has chops in the writing, performances, wit, And. It's better than any Sandler or Farrell movie recently released. The movie was well acted all the way around, with plenty of people you'll recognize from some of your favorite shows."
8502,"That said, Robot Overlords has enough on offer to prove enjoyable for anyone. "" Robot Overlords "" is a watchable sci - fi that is sort of Terminator and Transformers franchises entwined in a silly story for teens. Writers Jon Wright and Mark Stay borrow elements from classic film and TV science fiction shows, Matrix and Terminator - like flying machines, giant century robots, Borg space cubes and Stars Wars droid restraints to name a few. Quite happy with the world domination theme set somewhere in the future with mind control and Techno robots but also the great use of Tec, mixed in with Northern Ireland & Isle of Man. an intelligent and powerful bunch of robots made a transmitter than can get deactivated just by electricity."
8308,"BenoÃ®t Delhomme shoots to utter perfection. These scenes are, by far, the most heart wrenching scenes to watch. As the years pass, their lives are changed tremendously in very profound and heart - wrenching ways. Her performance is an emotional one and is beautifully and brilliantly portrayed as well and is also one of the year's best performances. She's not faking anything, she's really feeling and becoming Jane."
8118,"Moreover, another The Lego Movie's quality is that it has quite an impressive cast (Pratt, Ferrell, Banks, Day, Brie, Freeman, Hill, Neeson, Offerman, O'Neil, etc.), that portrays a bunch of very colorful and memorable characters. The implementation of real - world objects into the otherwise plastic world is certain to get huge laughs out of anyone, especially the revelation about the ominous superweapon "" Kragle "". Charming from beginning to end, with a few surprises you won't expect. And in this age of spin - offs, remakes, prequels, etc. originality is more valuable than ever. "" The Lego Movie "" was an awesome, super creative, and extremely satisfying film for all ages - that is, if you have ever played with Legos."
8309,"A great story with rich acting and camera work, the transition of scenes was flawless. Starry Eyes is a surprisingly successful and effective film and horror. The mood borrows from elements of Rosemary's Baby and Eyes Wide Shut but the setting is in a much more realistic environment, which works to great effect as the story progresses. Everyone's great and Louis Dezseran, in the relatively small part that he has, is very unsettling. It gets genuinely disturbing and hard to watch at times, but what draws you into it in the first place and what really makes you * believe * is the performances."
8141,"The animation is fantastic and the 3D adorns it. Burrell gives Peabody a suitably intellectual and clear sounding voice, giving an extra jolt of likability to the character. Other than that, it's an absolute treat both for children and adults. Together they go through multiple adventures and troubles but able to stay together. Despite this, "" Mr. Peabody & Sherman "" certainly does bring another high - quality piece of family entertainment to the big screen."
8310,"It's a beautiful and enchanting film, and one of the strongest of the nominees of what was mostly a solid line - up (one where even the weakest of the nominees, The Boxtrolls, had a lot of fine things about it). The atmosphere is enchanting, but it was the emotional impact that was even more resonant, it is a subject very easy to identify with and the most emotional parts were just heart - breaking. The voice work is fine, with an admirably nimble Brendan Gleeson and a charming and emotive Lucy O'Connell being particularly strong while David Rawle portrays Ben's development and emotions very believably as well. However, this is no ordinary animation: It swirls with pastels that morph into imaginative lines capturing humans and faeries as if the world supported both in their glory and despair--a phantasmagoric hot mess if you will. Selkies, magical beings that change from seals to humans, have the power to reverse such changes."
8588,"Caglar Corumlu is very funny as always and Ozan Guven acts so naturally. You may be idealistic filmmaker, but then again, KaÅŸar Ekmek. Cem YÄ±lmaz' and Ozan GÃ¼ven's splendid acting performances make these characters natural and convincing, and create them with an engaging self - irony, far from any showy pathetic effects. Although Cem Yilmaz works with the same faces again, he did a great job. The music in the film belongs to the group, MFO and perfectly fits the subject, the rhythm is great."
8557,"Well developed plot and some thought - provoking issue resolutions. Marc Strano at the helm of a film he costars in has done good work with Tiger Orange. The other lead character, Chet, played by writer Mark Strano, was well written. Strano and Valenti give life to two brothers who really seem to be real. "" Johnny Hazzard, "" the former porn star, turned in an exceptionally good performance."
8311,"The subtleties are impressive and worth revisiting. The addition of realistic award show backdrops added to the current condition of the music industry psyche. This is a character driven film and despite the familiar premise the movie is carried by the wonderful performances from the cast and their well written characters. Bythewood made an impact in 2000 with her feature film debut, Love & Basketball and she followed the success of that movie with The Secret Life of Bees. Gugu and Nate Parker gives an exceptional performance in their roles."
8201,"So yeah, friends of the director! That has more memorable characters, more charm and, more importantly, much more humour. Plenty of good laughs to be found in this film. It's a great movie that you can watch with your friends. Great soundtrack with plenty of 80's nostalgia."
8313,"Less smiling, more dark patches under the eyes, more bewildered looks. "" Citizenfour "" hits all the marks of a good documentary: it is topical, relevant, well organized and thought provoking. Through all of the discussion of his methods and the nature of the material he revealed, Snowden presents his case in an eloquent manner, remaining calm and centered, saying that he anticipated the consequences and is prepared for them. Ms. Poitras structures the film as a thriller, and it will certainly cause tension in every viewer. Poitras smartly includes President Obama condemning Snowden as unpatriotic and a danger to the American people, an argument going on even as you read this review."
8512,"Not quite a feel - good movie, not quite a rom - com and not quite a, er, well, anything else, really. Nothing to remember for the ages, but, fine. Next best thing is Debra Jo Rupp who is vastly under - used, under - represented and plays a superb, far too short part. But Mena Suvari is absolutely gorgeous (if that's not a too non-PC thing to say) and is one of the best things about this movie! How can a man be the best divorce lawyer and in his personal life to be a complete idiot?"
8314,"If you are looking at the line - up for the weekend and just want something everyone will enjoy, check out Horrible Bosses 2. There were so many funny moments from the best characters in Horrible Bosses plus the welcome addition of Chris Pine and Christopher Waltz. Hollywood's strategy of wringing every last ounce of life out of a successful idea via sequels, prequels, spin - offs and the "" partification "" of films has been discussed to death. Best Performance: Jason Sudekis Worst Performance: Lindsay Sloane Jennifer Aniston also returns as her sex - addicted dentist from the first film and gets to appear in the funniest scene of Horrible Bosses 2."
8139,"Fast - forward a few weeks and it turns out that their encounter has had more lasting consequences. In a classic case of opposites attracting, the free spirit and a button - down preppy take a shine to each other. Comedically it's on par with a lot of straight up comedies, but it separates itself by having true moments of drama. Obvious Child delivered 84 minutes of witty dialogue, excellent performance (Jenny Slate) and humor mixed with light drama. So, once Max (Jake Lacy) has been vetted by Donna's gay friend Joey (Gabe Liedman), he and Donna repair to his apartment for what all concerned assume will be a one - night stand."
8123,"It is about friendship more than anything else and that is why it works. Matty (hunter Cope) and Michael (Nicholas Braun) are best friends and have grown up together. Humor, Drama and every flavors in the movie are well balance so it is really an interesting movie to watch. Really great little movie full of honest feeling, and open dialog. For everyone else this will be a nice treat."
8315,It has plenty of surprises and it is after all a comedy wrapped into an animation movie that totally deserves the time spend watching it. There are a lot of very clever jokes and a second viewing is probably required to catch everything. There are big laughs and funny throughout. It is extremely entertaining to watch the action scenes unfold and the humor is top - notch. It has a lot of great references.
8316,"Don't wait for this to come to DVD, it is best appreciated on the big screen. Sensitive as well as thrilling musical score by David Hirschfelder, helped by Lisa Gerard. If you wish to be entertained at the movies this year then this is one of the best films to see. The two Turkish leads are brillian and bring a lot to the film as a whole. At the start of the 100th anniversary year of the Gallipoli landings, this is a story that was well worth telling."
8202,"The best scenes take place after the weary college story peters out Loaded with potential , 22 JUMP STREET is the sequel to the comedic buddy teamup (based on the 1980's Johnny Depp TV show) where Christopher Tatum and Jonah Hill posed as high schoolers to bust a drug dealer First act; they enter college, second act; their relationship is tested, third act; everything works out, happy ending. they have each other's backs and are best buds but going back to college shows each of them a new direction and their friendship is severely tested in this world of frat parties, pledging and that oh so American Institution. Something sequels actually have to do to win over audiences, a second time."
8318,"It is entertaining throughout and offers some twists. ==================================================================== ==================================================================== As a rewatch 08/09/17' The Voices is a highly entertaining dark comedy. This was very entertaining once everything began to unfold. Across the board, all of the performances were excellent. The voices is another lower independent film starring Reynolds."
8521,"This is anything but a cheery, feel - good romantic - comedy. This is a zany, screwball comedy at its core, the kind that has gone by the wayside in favor of more romantic, if incredulous, displays of romance and over-the-top comedy, despite lacking half the comedic talent and screen writing craziness. So much story potential and so many talented actors completely wasted by Hollywood accountants. It is a fun, beautiful places, good acting. A large part of the film's success is attributable to Brosnan, who does a smooth job at playing both unlikable, but undeniably suave."
8319,Longer than the standard TPB special it is a spectacular every seconds. The sharper new Netflix TPB looks slick and plays homage to both the series and Christmas Special. Everyone deserves a couple drinks at Christmas. But after Kev sends Bubbles a letter to go to Minneapolis the boys arrive with Ricky under the impression Minneapolis is at the North Pole thanks to Bubbles wanting to keep the Christmas Spirit.
8320,"After twenty years the cut is still there and looks very awkward. When the trail of an old enemy, presumed dead for decades, surfaces and coincides with Lake being diagnosed with a terminal form of dementia, the choice is easy. The most elevating moments are the motivational speeches he is asked to do for the new CIA agents in training. Anton Yelchin can be a good actor, too, with the right direction. Both Schrader and Cage have disowned this as released, yet Nicholas Cage gives one of his finest performances and that should be imperatively noted."
8179,"For fans of monster movies, "" Godzilla "" was surely one of the most anticipated releases of the year. Scenario 1: If you are going to see this film because you really enjoy classic Godzilla movies and you hope the music and campy theme of those films are represented in this one, you absolutely should go see it. Every character, from the wise but ignored token Japanese bloke, to the soldier's wife whose sole purpose is to wait at home to comfort him, is a dull Hollywood clichÃ©. Unlike in' Jaws', there are no interesting human characters here who could help create the kind of tension - heavy atmosphere or sense of impending doom the way Chief Brody, Hooper and Quint could 40 years ago. The atmosphere of mystery and dread is tangible; the human element is there, the acting and the dialogues are solid, and the production design is breathtaking (especially the apocalyptic images of an evacuated city in Japan which was left to decay for 15 years, overgrown with plants and with packs of wild dogs running in the streets)."
8322,"Not a great film, nor does it pretend to be, but for a small Indie look at the autopsy of the Boston Mafia it fares well. Downbeat locations and realistic dialogue seem to add a feeling of doom for the Mafia lifestyle that is portrayed as dying out. Harvey Keitel does his best, but he must have known this was going to be a Krimbo turkey from day one. It had all the right ingredients for a excellent film. The locations appear realistic enough, and the budget seems more than adequate."
8324,"Stylized heavily with its colors and the other external footage it uses, the film gives off an aged and exciting feel, similar to other movies from past decades. Renner's (THE HURT LOCK, THE BOURNE LEGACY) performance is captivating in its subtlety; allowing momentary characters including Norwin Meneses (Andy Garcia), Fred Weil (Michael Sheen) and Jerry Ceppos (Oliver Platt) to drive the story's factual elements in a similar manner experienced by Webb. It needs to be seen by a wider audience just as it would be wise to make "" Dr. Strangelove "" part of a core curriculum in the formal education of American adolescents. While nothing is surprising given the fame of the incident, director Michael Cuesta approaches this "" inspired - by "" biopic also as a thriller with dramatic underpinnings. Their smuggled cocaine was distributed as crack cocaine in Los Angeles, with the profits funneled back to the Contras."
8162,"With good performances that help not making a stupid waste time. Round - Up: This movie really does have some top names used as the voices of the characters. 4/10 Animation: It's beautiful, gorgeous, colorful, and worth watching on Blu - ray or Blu - ray 3D. The music has that Brazilian flavour and the songs are incredibly catchy. Roberto is superior in looks, physicality and singing."
8326,"- The incredible length of the scenes. Case in point two close scenes with a rider approaching and leaving were clearly CG. For all The Lord of the Rings' mythic grandeur and complex world - building, there's a warm geniality and brisk impetus to these lovingly crafted films. Granted, some of the battle scenes were innovative. Turn 310 pages of children's literature into an epic Hollywood trilogy."
8327,"David Oyelowo played a spectacular MLK. For DuVernay's second or third effort, it's quite an achievement what she manages to do with this film. DuVernay is more successful when she sticks to straightforward historical events. While there are major pacing issues with the film, DuVernay directs this with a determined efficiency that oozes out of every second of the film. The film's best moments come from Henry G. Sanders as Cager Lee, and between David Oyelowo and Tom Wilkinson as MLK and LBJ."
8328,"It's very easy to watch with its amazing array of beautiful colors and shots. It was nominated for three Academy Awards and won several others. It is a biography of the exciting life of Louis Silvie Zamperini of Torrance, California. The performances throughout the cast was good, Angelina Jolie got the what she needed from the cast to tell this story in this particular way. Perhaps the feature could have been extended by, say, thirty minutes; Angelina Jolie directed."
8329,"There are a couple of scenes really good. There are some really nice little moments sprinkled throughout. One lovely and immersing cinematic experience, bravo, Miss Amirpour! Without it this would be an intolerable bore featuring a few really strong cinematic moments. If done right, silences within scenes could be a powerful tool to assert things that no word can."
8137,"Take care of this moment because this is probably the only scene that will live up to your expectations. On a positive note, the extras in this film are HILARIOUS. Worth a DVD rental for some fun, but even in 3D it gets old. Every scene was just taking your expectations away bit for bit and makes you realise the inevitable truth that this Movie will take Place on the goddamn ships the whole time. This Great War that united the Greeks was barely touched on."
8136,"The camera work is outstanding considering such narrow space and the performances are magnificent. As the movie progresses, the stakes get higher and things just keep getting worse for Liam Neeson's character. Along the way, there are some sweet action scenes and plenty of moments to keep you guessing. There are a few camp and corny moments here and there, but the acting was realistic and believable enough to keep the movie dramatic and engaging. Overall, it's a great action film that is full of twists and turns that will make you glued to the screen and have you guessing the unpredictable outcomes."
8567,"The music, humor and love rise above the undeniable pain of Mr. Campbell's suffering. What a sweet and touching story about Glen Campbell's struggles with Alzheimer's disease. Standing tall not only as an incredibly moving and inspirational portrait of Campbell's admirable grace, humor, and above all courage in the face of a dreadful disease, but also as an equally touching and uplifting depiction of a wonderfully tight and compassionate family--doting fourth wife Kim, sons Cal and Shannon, and simply extraordinary daughter Ashley, whose song "" Remembering "" is positively devastating in its sweet emotional candor about her father's unfortunate plight--coming through for their husband and father like gangbusters in his time of greatest need. One important aspect of the documentary is that Campbell's doctors fully support his tour as they demonstrate how doing what he loves to do can strengthen certain parts of his brain and slow the progression of the disease. A clearly ecstatic Glen performed it before an energized and fully supportive crowd, in a performance that might even bring tears to your eyes; he even makes Paul McCarthy complete swoon over him backstage."
8299,"hopefully it will inspire viewers to learn more about this great man and the contribution he and the others at Bletchley Park made during the war. Masterfully told and encompassing an emotional complexity, Tyldum's film is both engrossing and disturbing. Mark Strong and Allen Leech also deliver memorable, fascinating scenes, both getting an opportunity to shine. She has all the things that make up an Oscar nominee; a scene that will likely bring you to tears, plenty of scenes that play as the comic relief in a dark tale, and being simply charming in every part of the film. All the cast are on top form, in orbit around a stellar performance by Benedict Cumberbatch that layers humour, complexity, sexuality and the palpable frustration of a brilliant mind not quite able to communicate with his fellow humans."
8134,"Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. These two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning atmosphere. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. The visuals in this film is majestic, everything is shot to a meticulously calculated level, Nolan - style. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way."
8133,"And Micheal B. Jordan, wow he was awesome. Well, there were a couple of awkward scenes but it added to the hilarity. Zac Efron, Miles Teller, and Michael B. Jordan are very capable actors. It was actually quite well - written, though treading on very familiar ground of male - female relationships and commitment phobia. He is the funniest and the most relaxed of the three main actors."
8177,"This film has greatly polarized critics for its use of controversial concepts. , but' Lucy' is still packed with enough creative ideas and great action scenes to get your money's worth. Starts off well, everything makes sense, everything is clever, logical and interesting. The main concept in this film is equally flexible because it has been proved a myth years ago. Fortunately, this film counts with solid performances from the whole cast, starting by Scarlett Johansson, who brings charisma and credibility."
8132,"This fast succession of little scenes is done so perfectly, it's a great joy to watch. And there are the great camera angles and the wonderful detailed sets to pay attention to. The set design and costumes are perfect, and there's so much attention to detail within the sets. This all is brought to perfection in Grandhotel Budapest. Newcomer Tony Revolori is excellent as well."
8131,"probably gave one of his best performances. About Last Night lands somewhere in the middle, but nonetheless is an entertaining movie with good performances and good chemistry. It wasn't just the honesty that gives About Last Night its edge above its usual contemporaries. The first 20 - 30 minutes of the movie are the funniest, and the strongest. There are some heartfelt moments in there, and the witty writing helps a lot."
8129,"But Barry and Mel play characters so who are so annoying and unnecessarily crude that it just becomes hard to watch. Just a fact, the wit, and charm of this movie; even in it's most childishly gross moments, is just simply enduring. When you push aside all of the inappropriateness and lewd behavior, Barry and Mel are very cute together and that comes out in their strong performances. Damon Wayans Jr., Hayes MacArthur, Brett Gelman and Thomas Middleditch, they all also did a great job. It was raunchy but so funny, comic timing by Labine and cast was perfect!"
8331,"Both Isaacs (Inside Llewyn Davis) and Chastain (Interstellar) deliver powerful performances that manage to be both relatable and fascinating. It's hard to take it all in while it's happening right before your eyes, but once you digest it and see it through, it becomes something you can't take your eyes off and, in turn, appreciate on many different levels. The performances are top - notch, beginning with relative newcomer Oscar Isaac in the lead role. High praise indeed for director J. C. Chandor (All Is Lost) and his talented cast. It's a fantastic period piece that creates an authentic, distinct look at 1980s New York, while tonally replicating films from that era."
8332,"That ends up perfectly predicting the audience reaction you see here via the reviews. Even the supporting characters have fascinating personalities and dialogues. Miss Dawson, with her looks and her personality, is incredible in her role. Gabrielle Union, J. B. Smoove, and Leslie Jones also added well to the mix here. It's observational, mature, witty, good - hearted, mostly a rom - com but also about the battle between external expectations and inner desire, young adulthood and maturity."
8562,"It is one of most intense movies of recent times. From the beginning, your eyes remain glued to the screen. Characters are made up, time is shortened, incidents are moved around, elements are put in for dramatic emphasis. Great supporting performances from Sarsgaard, Stuhlbarg and Schreiber. The suspense builds up as if you are watching the match happen live in front of your eyes."
8125,"Heaven is depicted as a place among the stars. Russell Crowe was great as Demi - Demon Pearly Soames. The Characters were immediately likable and the two child actresses were captivating. Swimming somewhere in the reams of quite lovely footage assembled by Goldsman and his cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, there's a great movie with great ideas. To his credit, Goldsman does try his best to make the fantasy enchanting."
8333,"Still, Big Eyes was mostly enjoyable enough the way it was told. The light and dark colors also contribute to the period atmosphere to pretty compelling effect. Tim Burton has crafted quite a reputation as a director of the surreal and the macabre. Big Eyes as the title shows is about the Big Eyes paintings. It's a "" light "" and easy movie, with some great performances by both leads, tight pacing, very nice writing and directing."
8334,"If you don't like musicals, fine! Just stick with televisions, "" Once Upon a Time "", for interesting twists on your favorite fairy tales. Where is the millions of dollars in production values? The story as a whole has some really good messages, but people seem to be stuck up on the fact that it defied their expectations. The singing is good (in some cases great), the acting is good, the costumes and "" sets "" are also often good."
8335,"Ansel Elgort is amazing, Jennifer Garner is also great. Wow, is there a lot of Serious Acting being Acted here. Since Men, Women & Children is an ensemble piece, the film was able to be stacked with notable actors and promising young actors: Adam Sandler, Rosemarie Dewitt, Jennifer Garner, Dean Norris, Judy Greer, Ansel Elgort, Kaitlyn Dever, Olivia Crocicchia, and Elena Kampouris. A marriage is on the rocks (Adam Sandler and Rosemarie Dewitt). The well conceived plot and dynamic characters are thanks in part to author of synonymously titled novel in which the film is based, Chad Kultgen."
8336,"Well you can rent it on YouTube, to it is worth that! Obviously it's a comedy, and in the category of comedy movies it will rank as one of the higher ones. It's honestly just another ridiculous Seth Rogen comedy. The movie is in no way perfect by all means, but it does have it's surprisingly funny and shocking moments. It's different comical aspects then what has been common in movie cinema in the past year."
8337,"All of Matthew Vaughn's movies have been good, and he was able to push it further with this one. People will have interesting reactions to this film. The action has its true Shakespearian / GoTh moments and all supported by cool tech - stuff. The well known stars all play against type, which makes this even more unreal. It is nice to see Samuel L. in the role of a bad guy."
8338,"Perhaps this comedy was the reason why the characters were also a shell of their former glory, and why they were pretty much background characters with the new exhibits. This movie is not an all - time great movie, but it is a cute, funny movie that will take your mind of the real world for 90 mins. You sit there watching the credits roll by and looking for a new journey to start. At the heart of the franchise is Ben Stiller, a comic actor with deceptively understated style, and this time he gets to plays two very contrasting roles, particularly funny when his characters interact. Also helping add to the fun in the film are cameos from an assortment of known Hollywood personalities."
8339,"It's okay, just use music from Game of Thrones, Clash of the Titans, Wrath of the Titans, and Robin Hood! Stathom's "" Wild Card "", "" In Cold Blood "". He takes on a new, young apprentice who is destined for greatness and blah blah blah prophecy, blah blah blah training, blah blah blah evil threat, blah blah blah fulfil his destiny type of thing. The originality the film offered in the villains was not terrible either. And there you go, an action - packed adventure with perilous monsters and witches lurking."
8340,"Kudos to the director and of course, to the palpable chemistry of Justin Long and Emmy Rossum which has played a major contribution in making this film a masterpiece indeed. Rossum keeps up with the banter well enough. "" Justin Long and Emmy Rossum have excellent chemistry together. The cast Justin Long and Emmy Rossum did a fine job and the chemistry between them truly works its way to the audience. But instead of a continuous straightforward narrative, "" Comet "" breaks up the scenes into seemingly random order."
8350,"It's a life full of tests and courage - Polsky shares an absolutely phenomenally detailed truth. A sometimes breathtaking documentary and the system succeeded in creating some of the best athletes ever. This is a fascinating look at human nature and how the culture of one's youth can directly impact the beliefs as an adult, so many years later. Their movements and intricate teamwork clashed mightily with the individualistic style of westerners So buckle in for 80 minutes of a riveting story, often with a lot of unexpected, wild humor."
8203,"The excellent performances by the cast are also what raise this movie well above your ordinary action movie. This scene takes place in a diner they frequent in Boston, and it's the first of two powerful moments in the film. Washington does well playing someone with a dark past who is still good at his game, the action scenes are brutal and fairly exciting, and the movie as a whole looks very nice. Though there are great choreographed fights, special effects and fantastic explosions, The Equalizer is more Bourne than Bond. This movie gives you everything you would want from an action film: guns, explosions and great effects."
8342,"Produced by French - based EuropaCorp, the Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen - scripted' Taken' was one of the most notable action films in recent memory when it was released back in 2008. Aside from the part of Stuart (husband to Famke Janssen's Lenore), the casting is consistent. This movie might be an entertaining movie to watch on DVD or video on demand. Key to its success was Neeson, whose viciously efficient qualities as the former CIA badass were excellent complement to the actor's natural gravitas and air of gentleman nobility. None of the clever stuff from the other 2 movies is here."
8204,"HTTYD is an amazing series and lets support it. The four years of work on it show, as it is a polished film. This film truly lives up to its expectations and builds upon its predecessor's achievements like any good sequel should, and from this, the outcome is stunning. With swooping and stunning visuals and epic animated set pieces, this is a sequel to remember, a modern masterpiece. DeBlois once again concocts some terrifyingly exhilarating sequences here, which make ample use of 3D for maximum elation."
8344,"The performances are OK, nothing special or worth mentioning. This isn't trying to be a groundbreaking heist film and yet it is groundbreaking for Australia, it is so well made, performances are stellar and the score is epic. Brendan's complete trust in JR, as well as his defense of him as the rest of the crew don't take such a shining to him, further entrenches these fatherly feelings. Luckily, Son of a Gun does with the latter, and skillful direction, several twists and versatile ending make this an okay film, where one cannot always guess how the things go or what happens next, and all this is carried out without ridiculous shifts. It's worth having in your movie collection, along with classics of the genre."
8205,"The mothers (characters) seem to be doing the best job from anyone else. Sound effects throughout are very clear and nicely put (for those scary moments you are waiting for to jump off your seat). Speaking of which, Haunt makes a good use of practical effects in order to bring the ghosts and appearances to shape, obtaining some good shocks and moments of a delicious suspense. Maybe this is all coincidental, but the house full of ghosts, the strange neighbor, it all seemed very familiar. For a ghost story that's complete with a haunted house, box that allows the living to communicate with the dead, and a pretty decent looking spirit, this is a complete snoozer."
8161,"It's a story thats believable with twists and unexpected turns. What makes this one work so well is a combination of a great trio of performances and the 80's retro styling. The minute details of 80's Texas are just impeccable. The performances are brilliant, Hall is stellar as a protective family man and the transformation his character is immaculate. Coming to the performances, the film boasts a badass cast in Michael C. Hall, Sam Shepard & Don Johnson and the trio are fabulous in their given roles."
8351,"She is seeing a guy, Hugh, who acts a little odd sometimes but otherwise seems nice and trustworthy so one night she consents to his advances and they share an awkward but intimate moment in the back of his car. It Follows takes a good deal from the greats in the horror genre, namely Halloween. This is how the really scary movies were made. It Follows is easily one of the most terrifying horror movies of the decade. It Follows is a throwback to classic late '70s - '80s horror films and draws many comparisons to John Carpenter's style, from the music to the cinematography, and rather than appearing like a carbon copy or rehash of Halloween, director David Robert Mitchell executes this odd premise with such flair and finesse that you can't help but be refreshed by its cleverness."
8352,"And that's thanks to Abigail Breslin who manages to give shape to the character Hannah in a natural and wonderful way. Breslin does a great job in this and smoothly handles the transition to a more adult role very well. It was bold, poignant, in some ways ground - breaking and in some heart - breaking. Despite the fact that the whole story is a bit exaggerated, improbable at times and thinking about it after wards sometimes pretty laughable, the acting of Abigail Breslin was very convincing and plausible. The movie itself isn't anything that original but it is tense at the right times and keeps you guessing just enough to make it entertaining and watchable."
8206,"It celebrates its own non-existence and drowns in its nihilism. None of the characters has done anything worth mentioning in all their lives. Transitions from age to age were beautiful. Boyhood is in fact an anti-film in the sense that it stands against everything film should be - be it an artistic masterpiece or just an entertaining, fun movie. What's so unique about' Boyhood' is that these individuals (including Ethan Hawke, Patricia Arquette, and Linklater's own daughter, Lorelei Linklater) evolve and age within a scripted narrative that is not' like' a time capsule, this is a completely authentic period piece that retraces an era from the cultural response to September 11th, through the election of Barrack Obama, and into the age of social media saturation."
8207,"A lot of the scenes were contrived and predictable. Here was a chance to make a slick, sexy, glossy movie using the guidance Mr. Harvey provides in his books. Most two year olds are far more thoughtful and mature. Dennis Haysbert, Jennifer Lewis, Tarji Henson, Jim Piddock and Michael Ealy are good actors whose talents were wasted in this movie. Sure it was fun to see everyone on screen playing off one another and enjoying themselves, and everyone turns in fun and great performances, but when Story tries to create dramatic tension, it goes nowhere and rushes by to fast as to get to the next scene with Hart making a fool of himself."
8178,"This is a terrific time at the movies. & This movie delivers a surprising top notch entertaining with a potent story and some good twists that help to live up expectations mixed with terrific special effects and cinematography. Great camera work â€” at some point, you will be rather amazed by the use of slow mo and 3D. But over all, it was an excellent, entertaining and relevant Xmen movie. Bryan Singer could handle the dramatic and epic scenes very well."
8093,"So, is it a good film for the scares? The very best aspect of the movie is the highly touted surprise ending, which ties up all of the loose ends of the franchise. The original movie follows Katie's terrorization and eventual possession. - The "" found footage "" modus operandi works just fine throughout a movie, and - acting is believable enough to root for the characters. But if you're into some good chills, give it a shot."
8226,"The scenery is perfect well chosen locations. It has some touching moments occasionally, its worth watching if you're bored. Are you rolling your eyes yet? There's still some very nice feel - good moments that are pulled off successfully, but there's so much bad to overlook it's not really worth it. The cast is wonderfully chosen and you keep having goosebumps all through the movie."
8208,"His family, his friends, dreams and aspirations are all present. Whether you sympathize with Swartz or not, the film does a solid job of showing how blind justice in the U. S. can be when it wants to be. From his earliest days, he was a prodigy, not only developing the skills of reading and processing information at an early age, but acquiring a unique ability to write programs and offer innovative solutions to many problems presented in the early years of the Internet. Swartz's story is told in a deeply moving and very disturbing documentary The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz, directed by Brian Knappenberger. She accused Swartz of violating Title 18 of the U. S. Code, which carries a maximum penalty of 50 years in jail and one million dollars in fines."
8209,"Gelvatron has a really nice plottwist and some scenes are decently funny. The only redeeming aspects of this movie are the exceptional CGI with some stunning 3D and the incredible sound. When sh*t does start hitting the fan later, it's just a bloody mess, with so much happening at once that you don't care about anything and none of it is particularly cool or memorable. Yes most of the action scenes were great, but come on, don't make it lame by adding something that doesn't belong there, like another horrific comment, phrase or something that isn't funny. But if you watch this film with no expectations, or at least want some action and good fighting for an evening with friends, you will be pleasently surprised."
8172,"Saying "" F*ck "" in every sentence does not give you street cred, nor is it particularly humorous after about 5 seconds. Quit having your writers put in sex scenes with you and the obviously unattainable women you are cast with. It's well made as in it looks good, some interesting direction especially in the party scenes but there is just nothing else. Shame on the producers, Evan Goldberg Seth Rogen, and James Weaver who backed and promoted this film. Why did it get such good reviews from critics and such a high score on IMDb?"
8168,"Brick Mansions is unimpressive, but crazy to say, also enjoyable. It may sound politically correct, but he really is the best thing about Brick Mansions. The greatest attractions are the performances of David Belle and Cyril Raffaelli. The French film is so much better on so many levels. There really are some well done set pieces from time to time."
8100,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating : 3/5 stars Lighthearted, easily pleasing, simplistic, formulaic, yet sufficiently entertaining buddy - cop action comedy. , "" Lethal Weapon 1 & 2 "", "" Midnight Run "", "" Beverly Hills Cop 1 & 2 "", "" Hot Fuzz "", "" Rush Hour 1 & 2 "", City Heat "", "" Red Heat "", "" Dhoom 1 & 2 "", and "" Last Action Hero "" to certified classics. He's in a loving relationship with Angela Payton (Tika Sumpter), who's very proud of Ben when he's accepted into the police academy. What it lacks in memorable action, it makes up for in it's funny scenes and dialogues. Unlike films like "" Identity Thief "" and "" A Madea Christmas, "" the tone of the film never strays from a comedic romp and always keeps the laughs coming."
8363,"They are superb to - gether and exhibit a special "" something "" that goes beyond their formidable individual acting talents. To watch these great stars on the screen, in parts befitting their, well. The scene in Rome is remarkably beautiful - as are many other moments in this wonderful movie. Fred (Christopher Plummer) has always been a good man who did everything he was supposed to do. This is a very nice movie, character studies of two people in the twilight time of their lives."
8366,"But it should be said, Aniston has done a brilliant job on this one. but Ms Aniston makes a brilliant job of it. Jennifer Aniston, though, is the standout. It's a beautiful, heartrending scene, and the decision to rest Cake on Jennifer Aniston's shoulders was absolutely the right one. The film lives and breathes, succeeds and soars, and stands tall by the work of Jennifer Aniston."
8367,"Walhbergs character is pretty unique, and borders on unbelievable, but it very consistent and represents very real emotions. Life is a high stakes game. Yes the film has several excellent co-stars like George Kennedy, Andre Braugher, and Richard Schiff. Wahlberg is surrounded by other performers, who work equally well at matching his level of conviction, specifically Goodman, whose few scenes in the film amount to greatness in a predictable yet pleasant manner. The Gambler features great performances from Mark Wahlberg and Jessica Lange along with flashy and stylish direction from Rupert Wyatt."
8195,"The bedroom scenes with Richard and Kai are ethereal and touching. Breathtaking cinematography creates a halcyon beauty to their connection with one another. The performances were that good and very moving. Echoes of Wong Kar Wai resonate beautifully throughout this very moving and understated, and yet very funny film. Ben Whishaw and Cheng Pei Pei gave stellar performances."
8371,"Adrien Brody gave a decent performance as a man who got broken in his decade in prison, but this performance goes over weakly in this mediocre film that did not develop his character enough for Brody's attempts at heart breaking scene stealing. No big deal at all, just a bunch of amateurs going in a bank and hope they don't get caught. Just putting known actors in a film does not a good film make, an intelligent well - written script helps and this was just thrown together without much thought. Jordana Brewster looks great and was probably the only redeeming quality of the film for that reason alone. Hayden Christensen can definitely deliver better performance, in fact he did in Takers, which is exactly the same genre."
8159,"Excellent performances by Pat Short and Dylan Moran. If your a fan of the McDonaghs stuff you'll love this. and the rest of the cast turn in believable performances. All in all a great movie of its time with strong performances and a great story. Calvary is a powerful film with great performances and some sharp writing, and that is why this is one of the must see films of 2014."
8211,"Fassbender delivers an extremely physical performance. Fassbender is great and the head thing really works for him. One of the largest payoffs for Ronson and Straughan's script is forwarding the narrative a year while the group is in the cabin. The first half of "" Frank "" focuses more on the creative process and the mental headspace necessary to operate at peak creativity. Fortunately they have two major, definitely not mediocre, talents on hand to maintain the required balance: Michael Fassbender and Maggie Gyllenhaal, who are both amazing."
8212,"David Wain and his well - established troupe of actor - comedians--along with a few new brilliant featured players--have done it again. If you love to laugh at the expense of cheesy romcoms, then you're in for a real treat. It's a spoof movie at its core, standing head - and - shoulders above other spoofs due to great writing and a brilliant cast. Paul Rudd and Amy Poehler (who worked with Wain on "" Wet Hot American Summer "") have very good chemistry and the rest of the cast laughs along with them. Paul Rudd and Amy Poehler are ace in their roles as lead caricatures, and even during the dumber moments they still give believable performances."
8213,"Also, there are a lot of great messages and a lot of references to things in real life. The first "" Planes "" was a pleasant surprise. 78/100 B P. S: THE MUSIC STILL ROCKS! The fire fighting scenes are quite exciting and a vast improvement over the first movie. As such there are nods, often irreverently funny, to some of the recognizable entities in their other films."
8214,"She's actually quite excellent, and has some complexities (she's a major alcoholic, for one). Tammy boasts a pretty good cast from Susan Surrandon to Kathy Bates and Toni Collette, it has all the ingredients to make a pretty good film. Oh, and then there's the love interest, Mark Duplass. Comedian Aisha Tyler once stated that comedians should take the first punch during their stand - up / hosting / entertaining performances. McCarthy owns her figure and the expected judgment, but what makes "" Tammy "" funny is the facial expressions and enunciation McCarthy uses when reciting witless lines of dialogue."
8215,"The two performances of the actors quite simply magnificent. You believe everything these characters are doing, and that's what makes this movie work so well. The performances of the two leads are outstanding for bringing the real heart of the picture. Which in this day and age of horror retreads, sequel frenzies and blood for blood's sake, is most refreshing. The Babadook is written and directed by Jennifer Kent."
8194,"It's got some great performances along with a great script. They were really good, did key performances alongside John Hamm's JB character. The reason is that this movie is how a movie should be, a funny, smart, family drama with good performances and leaves you with a feel good mood after exiting the theater. John Hamm's one of the best performances. Suraj Sharma has a bright acting future and Amit looked very cute."
8216,"Simmons's performance is flawless and breathless, a truly resonant achievement, and one of the most Oscar - deserving performances of recent years. Great job to all involved and congrats on winning the award at Sundance, you certainly earned it. Only one of the best damn dramas of this century to date. Chazelle has done a masterful job in casting the two leads in Teller and Simmons. Each turn of the story shapes his expectations and ambitions and then escalates it to the right point."
8217,"Fincher exercises upon his trademarks with the swift and stunning cinematography, the chilling score and tight editing, all of which makes' Gone Girl' a movie full of great visual storytelling. The acting is decent to middling, with Affleck probably giving one of the better performances overall, and Tyler Perry actually being an enjoyable aside. For starters, it is portrayed as this suspenseful thriller where there are constant twists and turns and you never really know what is truly happening. By far one of the best acting performances to have come from Ben Affleck ,' Gone Girl' boasts some strong yet disturbing portrayals from Rosamund Pike, Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry and Affleck. Also, apparently even though she plotted all along to have her husband executed, she somehow had the presence of mind to save the sperm sample, keep it, then AFTER he is exonerated and she has to alter her plans to return to him last minute after murdering someone else, has the means to get it successfully implanted in herself."
8219,"In Life Itself, Ebert is captured in some of his most vulnerable moments but ironically, at his strongest point in his life. There are as many reviews as there are persons and, paradoxically, the more personal the review, the more interesting it gets. The film takes their most electric moments and it fills you with the fiery passion for cinema, something that's too easily diluted over time. The film chronicles Ebert's rise to fame in the sixties as an ambitious reporter to becoming a syndicated film personality (along with his fellow critic, Gene Siskel) on his highly popular programs, Sneak Previews, At the Movies, and finally Siskel & Ebert which brought him fame and fortune in the next decades. LIFE ITSELF, based on the book of the same name, covers the life and career of film critic Roger Ebert who is of course best known for his television show with Gene Siskel."
8383,"As the story progresses, he is faced with various moral dilemmas. The story is captivating, and it's helped by the intensity of the marvellous performances of Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield. But with an actor like Shannon, one of the most confident and reliable actors working today, Bahrani needs not have this fear of relinquishing control of character development. Kudos to those involved with casting as every actor / actress, from the leading Andrew Garfield and Michael Shannon, right down to those who were only in one or two scenes, did a really good job. Nash's choices and inner struggle is a sharp and dangerous double - edged sword."
8220,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes will surely entertain. Andy Serkis delivers one of his most satisfying performances to date. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes transcends the Hollywood blockbuster. At the same time the apes evolve and become intelligent. Good vs. Bad meet in the middle and spirals out to both sides.
8192,"Liman and McQuarrie carry this movie with smart pacing, transitions and that certain magic good filmmakers seem to be able to harness at will. McQuarrie is a wonderful screenwriter, and these two seemed like a perfect pair. There on, it's a thrilling ride of finding out what's causing these repetitions and finding a means to put an end to it. No setting up sequels, no ambiguous crap, just a solid, fitting ending. The CGI and the special effects are seamless and bring the great set pieces and the relentless aliens to life."
8191,"Charlize and Liam and Sarah Silverman etc are terrific. The photography of the Utah locations is gorgeous. It's not a timeless piece of comedy, but it's got spunk, wonderful production values, inspired comedic acting (even the' bit' roles), and it has well - turned moments of stunningly genuine romance. Joel McNeely's western score is sumptuous (gotta love a western soundtrack) and the songs (including the moustache song and the title song) are both catchy and suitably ridiculous. Liam Neeson's casting as the villain was indeed a good choice and he pulls off the role very well, especially alongside the stunning Charlize Theron in all her glory."
8223,"Frances Sternhagen is a very welcome presence. It is engaging and poignant, and has lines (particularly those from Frances Sternhagen) that are hilarious. The opening credits come with background of endearing "" Both sides now "", which is a brilliant choice so aptly setting the mood of the entire movie. otherwise, this film works, just as many other older rom - coms do. Her songs are soulful and wonderful."
8224,"All in all, it had it's good moments and its bad but it was a fun enough watch for a Saturday night. The acting in "" Premature "" was good, and lead actor John Karna carried the movie quite nicely. And it was a treat to see Alan Tudyk in the movie as well. However there are some genuinely funny laugh out loud moments. Premature is an average film with a few funny scenes, but nothing extraordinary or particularly interesting."
8225,"All the funny parts are already there in that short clip. And, if you check out the online reviews, you'll see that most people pretty much agreed with its nominations. and hokey previews, then it's probably going to expel respect out of the reputation of the once acclaimed Diaz and the always - promising Segal. For the sake of the film, these characters are needed but the actors in the roles are surprisingly typecast at this point. The adjective "" atrocious "" was used in numerous film reviews in describing "" Sex Tape ""."
8390,"The 5 lead actors were all pretty solid and gave credible performances. Performances are good - most actors seemed to be a bit out of their typical roles. Each character was evenly distributed and explored, creating fairly interesting protagonists and slight emotional attachment. In spite of the hammy performances, the disjointed narrative, and the overall sensibility of utter lifelessness that the film has, it is still by and large an entertaining flick. They are mostly silly, suffering from a few red herrings that hurt the story's credibility, but it's still entertaining to watch them unfold."
8101,"Movie reviews, news, chat, even the occasional free ticket giveaway. There are a couple of scenes that deliver good suspense. All in all, the story line, chronology, acting etc in this movie are okay, but too clichÃ© as most scenes are predictable. A super intelligent former marine, war hero, who recovered from a wound he acquired saving his fellow marines, becomes an analyst for the CIA. Where previous Ryan films had large political stakes that brought real tension, the stakes here seem to be more economic than fear for great loss and limb, although the third act implies some mayhem."
8227,"The Purge: Anarchy rights the wrongs of its predecessor and delivers on the high concept. Once again James DeMonaco took the helm as writer and director of The Purge's sequel Anarchy. "" James DeMonaco returns as the director and writer of the sequel to his 2013 film, The Purge. The action scenes are done well, and the tension is enough to keep interest even in the low parts of the film. Every moment you think is safe leads directly into the next moment of pressure for the main characters, and you can't help but sympathize for the characters who (all but one) don't even want to be stuck out here on this horrid night."
8189,"As this kind of cheesy, self - spoofing entertainment goes, it's actually pretty funny, enough of the time to make it a pleasant viewing. In the end of the credits, there is a hilarious scene with the "" zombees "". The characters are pretty standard issue - they're young, attractive, and horny. The script rarely wastes any time; once the zombeavers are introduced, the pace is effective. What is nice is seeing old school makeup effects and puppeteering where one would ordinarily see CGI nowadays."
8229,"All in all, Guardians of the Galaxy was an awesome watch. but the good guys have some sexy vessels indeed. The answer is a resounding "" yes, "" as Guardians of the Galaxy is not only an exceptionally well - made comic - book film, but an exceptionally well - made film, period. Guardians of the Galaxy is nothing short of an amazing movie. Star wars), only in Star Wars, the process was more real and more fun."
8230,"It is filled with quips, familiar faces, memories of the 80's and just good fun. For his brief time on screen Ford brings style to the proceedings and simply radiates presence. A few amusing scenes with Snipes and prison. Jason Statham has less to do in this movie than the other movies, but he gives his usual fine performance as Christmas. The movie follows The Expendables on a mission to stop a weapon's trade, they discover an old foe once thought dead (Gibson), takes out one of their own."
8231,"You know, of Hercules and his amazing feats of heroism? Everything from beginning the film with the ever popular "" you think you know the story of Hercules? However, as an artistic representation of not only the myths, but a possible truth behind the myths, this was an entertaining watch. If the trailer was done properly this would not be a problem, because if you can put the trailer and the marketing out of your mind, what you actually have is a decent popcorn flick that is by far the most compelling telling of Hercules on - screen since the animated Disney tale, and in many respects it surpasses that tale in a much more satisfying manner. The supporting cast are all quite good - it was interesting to see Rufus Sewell playing a goodie for once (kind of like a young Ian McShane even though McShane was also in the film, with all the best moments of humour), and John Hurt gets to play both ends of the spectrum, meek and scenery - chewing."
8232,"She also follows in her footsteps to Italy, and later makes a moving and eye opening visit to the home of her biological father to meet her other family. Sophia also draws upon extensive archival material and actual footage of the camps to give audiences some understanding of the historical context of her mother's journey. Extraordinarily poignant and a powerful documentary providing an incredible insight into one woman's epic struggle to survive WWII, Stalin's gulags and how she triumphs over impossible odds. In the end it's a love story of a daughter telling her mothers will to live and make a new life for herself and her daughter in a new land. This is a poignant, bittersweet, intimate and deeply personal film that is also an insightful and moving exploration of the immigrant experience, displacement, reconciliation, forgiveness and the powerful bond between a mother and her daughter."
8233,"But the real appeal here is a) LeCarre's dark, dark, dark worldview and b) Hoffman's superb acting. She relaxes herself into the role, working well off some of the screen's most gifted performers. With a gritty yet polished aesthetic, Corbijn knows exactly how he wants his film to look and feel. There are many supporting actors like Rachel Mcadams, Willem Dafoe, etc who are good. A Most Wanted Man is pure CarrÃ©, and pure Hoffman, and that's why you should see it."
8152,"Here is a battle of the egos that will have you roaring with laughter. And while the Muppets are known for their songs, turning each movie into an adventurous musical, the tunes here seem more like distractions from lack of plot than singing - dialogue to carry the story, which worked especially good in THE MUPPET MOVIE Considering the hilarious, genre - bashing songs he made famous with Flight Of The Conchords, it feels as if he didn't even try. Ty Furrell is a talented funny man, showing timing to rival The Three Stooges and mimicking some of the great funny men of the past. And there's one of the greatest romances in history, a relationship full of friction and angst, with a man who won't commit and a very pushy girl, with an amazing and feisty personality."
8234,"The new setting is one of the stars because this feature looks stunning. They bounce off each other perfectly, & in terms of great on screen pairings, they are right up there with some of the best. The locations are gorgeous, and the soundtrack adds to the grandeur of place. The beauty of Italy, including Liguria, Tuscany, Rome, Amalfi and Caprio, are sumptuously captured by cinematographer James Clarke. This new version is much of the same, and as the title suggests, yes you've guessed it, sees this clever duo wining & dining in some great Italian locations."
8404,"Dupieux lines up again into a circular, nearly closed form of movie - making, that allows him to break out into freedom. The storyline edits weave jaggedly into each other in a provocative manner and the art house ingredient, psychedelic in its simplicity, works its magic once it has taken hold of you. This is an incredibly odd film that basically occupies itself with contradicting everything you might expect. the award is presented by Oscar winning director Michel Hazanavicius (The Artist) and Roxane Mesquida (who was in Rubber). Quentin Dupeiux, who has dictated other strange and surreal dark comedies such as Rubber and Wrong, knows his films are unique, and he knows what he's doing and he proves no differently with this film."
8188,"Woolverton and Jolie have crafted a masterpiece. Not to mention a good composition that captures significant moments without boredom. A comprehensive movie, there's a little something for audiences of all ages, truly a masterpiece. The plot naturally goes along with coherent and succinct narrations that add an in - depth storytelling. It was amusing to see Angelina play a role that requires a lot of nuances to pull of this character with a lot of depth as opposed to the one - dimensional character from the movie."
8187,"In comes the hilarious, handicapped teenager living next door who serves as the antidote to all her problems. This movie is so smartly written by Amy Lowe Starbin. The three leads are superb as well, esp. Their relationship starts to evolve into something more as events happen, and wow! Josh Hopkins ("" CougarTown "") plays her hubbie who is stuck at the office all day, leaving her to start hanging out with the next door high school wheelchair - bound teen, played excellently by newcomer Jonny Weston."
8236,"Despite the order of the scenes though, Get On Up has some impressive production behind the movie. Two viewings in three days, to fully appreciate the magnificent achievement that's on screen. Boseman steals the show, managing to bring a lot of energy and fun into the enigmatic Brown. Watching the movie one finds that his influence was immense on many of the musicians that followed him in all the many forms American music has evolved over the time, from rhythm and blues to rock and roll. But Boseman is equally true portraying Brown at any age, any stage, from any distance."
8158,"Fascinating visuals, wonderful eye opening colors. He's humble and soft - spoken at the right times and confident in others. Her dynamic with Garfield is surprisingly one of the strongest portions of the film. The action is fun, fast and so Spider - Man if that means anything. Initial Review: The Amazing Spider Man 2 is definitely one of the best movies of the year!"
8185,"By the looks of Blended, he is moving back in that serious direction. Guys and girls and even kids will enjoy it. There's still a solid place for his films and many people will continue to watch and enjoy them. The Africa setting was beautiful and the scenes in the hotel were gorgeous. Deep within Adam Sandler is a gifted actor that can light up the screen, if given a good script and a good director."
8238,"but it's a fun summery concoction of scenery, whimsy and costumes. Clues are deftly scattered, parallels emerge, the expected happens in unexpected ways, it's delightful. The usual Wody Allen themes are quite prominent but still wrapped in this pleasant summer fare. MITM is a totally pleasant whimsical delight. Next, the scenery is the kind to put your eyes out while the costumes, cinematography, and lively direction make for a most enjoyable film."
8239,"The performances are fantastic all round. They can bring as much surprises as the events do. The dialog, facial expression and spot on timing of the action keep this mash up of genres amusing every step of the way. Although two very different movies, it's the fresh and entertaining take on the genre that really stands out. The movie is full of surprises and comical elements that keeps the somewhat darker story light at heart."
8196,"In his depression he stops talking to girl (because romantic movies need a moment of sad separation which can always be easily resolved after some days by talking). The acting perhaps was one of the best aspects of this movie. This movie, simply put, is worth each and every one of its 125 minutes. The chemistry between Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elsort is astounding and the performances were astonishing. The pacing was perfect, the acting was phenomenal, the direction, editing and cinematography was exceptional and overall, this movie is one of the best romantic comedies that have ever touched the face of the earth."
8241,"That "" honor "" would go to William Fichtner's character, Eric sounds - like - sex Sacks. The best actor of the bunch, William Fichtner. Grew up with the comics and cartoon show, loved the 1990 movie. In 1990, April O'Neil was the hot shot news reporter that made the amazing discovery of the Turtles and she developed an amazing bond with them. The solution: a marathon of the late 80's cartoon followed by a viewing of the 1990 movie."
8242,"The overall themes and concepts (such as sameness, colors, emotion, and love), were portrayed ingeniously throughout the movie. To wrap this review up, The Giver is a thoroughly enjoyable movie by how fantastic the emotions are presented. The contrast of the sensory - rich memories of the past with the colorless and boring Utopian community is what brought real depth to the film. Jonas learns emotions such as love and fear and the concept of family. Each memory brings about it a new set of feelings each further developing Jonas to make the choices he makes."
8415,"It definitely is different than movies that you would typically see Adam Sandler in, but none the less still a really good movie. Cinematography is slightly somber, certainly a change of pace from Sandler's usual overly colorful tone. having his own life, problems, having fun. Sandler, played out of his comfort zone and he won. Adam Sandler take a different role than his usual silly middle age men role."
8157,"This is honestly, by far, one of the best sequels in existence today. Needless to say, the performances are top notch. It has everything a perfect martial arts movie has to have, and it deserves to be regarded as one of the best in its genre. It's such a superb performance to take those kinds of angles. It's superior to its predecessor in terms of story telling, considering the running time, and the choreography was also quite a bit improved from the already unforgettable moves in the first one."
8546,"Lawrence and David O. Russell take you on an emotional journey with "" Joy . "" This process is refreshingly unique in that she constantly thinks on her feet and resolves situations with surprising results. It is a wonderful story that should have received better reviews. Joy is the story of a strong woman that fights against all odds and wins. Also the grandmother role (Diane Ladd) which also was the narrator of the whole film was very powerful to the whole film, because she was the the person who encouraged joy to become a important person in this world."
8240,"Amazing visuals, great SciFi story line. Purely as escapist entertainment, "" Jupiter Ascending "" is awesome. Jupiter Ascending is a great movie. Good on Mr. Redmayne because he succeeded. For a start, like all sci - fi films, Jupiter Ascending is ambitious in its storytelling."
8290,"Equally, the craft behind Ex_Machina is exceptional. Bates lives in the middle of the American wilderness (in reality, a very picturesque Norway) and in a property that actually exists (BlueBook the Juvet Hotel). Not only do ideas shine, but the acting out of the three leads is incredible to say the least! Performances from all three leads are flawless and every other aspect of the production, from the cinematography to the soundtrack, is perfectly suited for the story. The performances are excellent, most notably Alicia Vikander as the beguiling Ava, who absolutely passes for being' almost human'."
8312,"The action is staged well, and the special effects and production designs are incredibly polished. Light, wholesome, and heavy on adventure, JW harkens back to the big Hollywood "" event "" blockbusters of the 80s and 90s. There are more than a few nice moments where you get to enjoy the park as it was "" intended "". Jurassic World successfully mines from the franchise name a good B - caliber FX spectacular. With them, there are a lot of great moments, in particular their communication with Owen."
8317,"And in general the scope, set pieces, and CGI are top notch. The first Mazerunner kept the mystery, pace, energy, and most importantly action, all at such a great length and mood of importance, that it was hard not to like. Both great movies, but NOTHING similar about them. The Scorch Trials got some great and intense, action packed scenes, good acting and cool environments but that's it. If you're a teenager looking for some adventure that isn't all "" dark "" and "" gritty "" - the buzz words of films nowadays - then you may enjoy this."
8341,"This is a great movie definitely in the style of Niell Blomkamp. The technical bits: the story craft, the plotting, pacing, editing, art directing, effects, all superb and SEAMLESSLY EXECUTED. Dev Pattel is well cast, did the role total justice. It will prove that you have a heart, and more sentient than the average Borgs who's tied into "" networked group mind "" opinions. If you like Neill Blomkamp's directing and style you will love this movie."
8343,"In reality, if computers are depicted in realistic terms in film, most people just wont get it. Working off a screenplay from Morgan Davis Foehl, Mann seems to focus more on having the shakiest hand - held cinematography not in a Paranormal Activity film than actually telling a coherent story with good characters. Once again, it feels like a film from a different time period that hearkens back to the classic noir movies of yesteryear, something like Three Days of the Condor. Further, the types of attacks are entirely plausible given real world research conducted by the NSA, Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and others. Given his skillset, he could have just hacked into MI6, gotten a fancy watch and car full of gadgets and lived out the rest of his days as 007."
8345,"TG jumps into the bandwagon of using time travel as a rebooting device, which currently is the go - to template for many franchises (XMEN, Star Trek). The story is convincing enough and can be the prelude of new additions to this series. Everything that happened in Terminator 1 - 5 will just be one of those timelines and anything can be changed at any time, including a win against Skynet if it ever happens. The number of inconsistencies and paradoxes in the "" butterfly effect "" of the story is amazing. The whys and hows of the T - 1000 were cleverly hidden away and never discussed."
8353,"This movie is so incredibly filmed and the stunts are performed marvelously. You have the high - powered Warrior Rig driven by Furiosa. George Miller has put together some of the greatest, most memorable action set - pieces ever. Tom Hardy breaths life into Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron is excellent and emotionally perfect as Furiosa. One of the allures of this series is seeing the outlandish road vehicles that are used, and in this the movie mostly delivers."
8354,"All the beautiful and smart people are elsewhere (non-sequeled movies). On the one hand, the 1977 film Star Wars was a masterpiece on the other Episode VII is a naked cash grab that could have been making fun of the Star Wars phenomenon. He works hard for the money, sooo hard for the money, he works hard for the moneeey and still can't get it right!"
8357,"James Spader did a terrific excellent job playing Ultron. Camera angles that were purposefully shot for the intentional thrill of 3D is like any other angles used in any other 3D - movie - going - experience. But good moments don't make a good movie. Marvel Studios has a history of roping in "" irreverent "" and "" edgy "" directors. The constituents of a factory assembly line whose sole goal is the procurement of money."
8358,"It turns out they used the opportunity to make one of their best movies yet. This is the highlight of the picture, where from a daily routine, such as the running water in the bathroom, the movement of insects, there is a really exciting show that does not get bored, at least because of its novelty and uniqueness. The are two post credit scenes which are fantastic and really tie into the larger universe. A couple of brilliant lip sync scenes, one featuring the requisite Stan Lee cameo, are grin - inducing pleasures. Love between the parent and the child, family ties are not just superficial, or for the species, they occupy an important place in the picture, which also gives an impression of a small share of its dramatic and soulfulness."
8359,"These three movies weren't memorable. Fantastic Four is a film very much out of time and place in today's market of superhero movies. ' Chronicle' may have been a perfect calling card for Trank, but' Fantastic Four' shows a young, inexperienced director completely out of his depth, absolutely justifying the advance bad buzz it had spent months battling. They have each impressed in their own way prior to Fantastic Four but every single one of them has the range of the cast in Tim Story's Fantastic Four films and waste their talents in Trank's reboot. The energy that gives them their abilities appears as some slimy green goo that belongs entirely in a C - grade Syfy TV movie, while their powers â€“ whether Reed's rubber limbs or Sue's telekinesis or Johnny's pyrotechnics or Ben's rock - covered body â€“ look equally cheesy."
8368,"Sometimes imagination is more powerful than just about anything and can give you an erotic experience. Complete and total thumbs down to the movie, the book, the series, and to the author. This film doesn't fulfill the most inane imagination, let alone someone who really has a wild and creative one. The man in the relationship, Chris, in a career - ending performance portrayed by Jamie Doormat, is a control - freak who must be in control in everything he does, including the life of his BDSM buddy, Ana."
8373,"The facial expressions are priceless and memorable. It's a fresh idea, , new definitions and it's kinda purposeful which makes it a bit exciting. A fan of Mae Whitman, Robbie Amell is the clear star of this film. The performances by Mae Whitman, Robbie Amell, Allison Janney and Ken Jeong are especially hilarious and very entertaining. Mae Whitman provides a lovely, funny and intelligent character, Robbie Amell was interesting and fun too."
8375,"They can go back and win more lotteries any time they wanted to. Teenager David Raskin (A very good Jonny Weston, an actor clearly with a good career ahead of him) is a bit of a brain box at school. Each time that the teenagers interfere with the past for personal profit, the future changes and the responsible David tries to fix it. The teenager David Raskin (Jonny Weston) is a genius that dreams on joining the MIT. They do it anyway, and use time travel to get better answers on their tests, and to get girls, win the lottery, humiliate the school bully, and get back stage passes to an Imagine Dragons gig."
8376,"Well worth an hour of anyones time. Presented in a very high resolution file, the image was incredibly sharp â€“ whether seeing individual beads of sweat on Louis' head is your thing or not, the quality is very good. Humor works in profound ways so much akin to illogical jazz. The subjects are your standard ones of getting older, sexual material, parenting, flying, and other such things; although familiar he does bring to these well. It's all about surprise, dismantling, abrupt leaps in narrative, rearranging walls so you can find unexpected openings to views."
8377,"The film is helmed with a strong and undeniable confidence from Saoirse Ronan. Performance-Wise: Saoirse Ronan is in great form. Saoirse Ronan is spectacular in her performance as Eilis. Combine that with the vision of John Crowley and the Oscar worthy performance by the breathtaking Saoirse Ronan, and you just have this brilliant and amazing heart warming movie. Returning to Ireland for what she hopes is a brief stay, Eilis both sees through and is seen in a luminous and different light."
8378,"No, Ponsoldt is subtle and reserves his ego. But screenwriter Donald Marguiles makes it work, and the result is an insightful, often hilarious film. And James Ponsoldt (Director of Spectacular Now and Smashed) presented the two main characters' relationship perfectly. And what's great about this is how his films point out that you don't need intricate sets or perfectly symmetrical shots to create beauty. Still Mr Segel is most effective in breathing life into the man such that you would love to have known him."
8379,"It was a psychologically riveting experience that provided a lot to think about long after the end credits rolled. The edits, at times, seem to happen because they can rather than for any good reason. The most compelling aspect of the film is Finkel coming to grips with the fact that he has to determining what is the truth and what is a lie. After turning in excellent (and, to some, surprising) dramatic performances in Oscar - nominated supporting roles in Moneyball and the Wolf of Wall St., Hill, or someone in his camp, decided it was time to take a crack at a dramatic leading man role. There are times True Story comes off as little more than a made for TV movie, but the best moments more than make up for it, and Franco's portrayal will stick with you long after Finkel finally understands who and what he is dealing with."
8380,"net) website years and years ago. But overall, it's well written and the interviewees do a great job of narrating their experiences. Scientology had a lot more members then, so there were dozens of these people wandering around, trying to look important and accomplished. The film plays an important role in documenting the eyewitness testimony of the many inhumane abuses that occur in this organization. There is very much important data from earlier documentaries missing here, many key persons are left out of the picture, which nevertheless is completed by the new ones appearing, corroborating all previous testimonies."
8381,"is a great introduction to her sense of humour and expert delivery. Nevertheless, Tig is still a very funny and poignant portrait of a great modern comedienne. It may repeat its best moments later, but they still get laughs. Netflix's documentary Tig is good catchup for anyone with a passing interest, and a brisk way to get the full story. The doc is typically held back by its short ambitions, besides attractively composed interviews, you wish they had better footage in the verite scenes."
8382,"Through skillful use of archival audio and film, interviews and other contextual materials, and clearly with a genuine appreciation and love for the subject, Liz Garbus has found the thread that strings all of this material together; the genius and passion of a driven artist. The character in this film is, in many ways, much like Simone--with lots of brilliance as well as lots of personal demons. This led to a lot of financial success in the 1950s and into the 60s and life was looking grand for this lady. These are combined with insightful interviews from her ex-husband and manager Andrew Stroud, collaborators like Al Shackman (her guitarist) and George Wein (founder of Newport Jazz Festival), and her daughter Lisa Simone Kelly. Ms. Garbus' tribute to one of the greatest jazz vocalists is worthy of your attention."
8384,"But here, he's really sank to a new low, and his career is now sitting comfortably with Cuba Gooding JRs as having the biggest career nose - dive in history. This subject matter of a bromance gone to an awkward level is a welcome addition in a time where fluid sexuality is a pervasive theme within todays hot topics. Jack Black has had one of the strangest careers in Hollywood for a once A-list star. Black is ideal for Dan, a complex character, as his wild, larger - than - life personality and rapidly changing moods are handled with expert realism and genuine talent. Both actors shine there with controlled performances rarely seen in a comedy (like this one been marketed as)."
8385,"Every technical aspect, direction, soundtrack, performances gets a gold star. He handled the serious intense scenes well, he delivered so great on the comedy and has definitely opened the door on his movie career. Dope is easily one of the most interesting and by far unique films of the last few years. The few definitions of the word are addressed at the beginning of the film, most notably as a slang term referring to something that is "" very good "". The writing is sharp and humorous, with the acting from the main trio - Shameik Moore, Tony Revolori, and Kiersey Clemons - complimenting it excellently."
8386,"The director, Alfonso Gomez - Rejon, did an amazing job here. Thomas Mann, Olivia Cooke, and RJ Cyler were also brilliant in every way. John Bernthal is good in everything. The performances in this film are all magnetic. The adults are all superbly cast as well."
8387,"The movie is quirky, and hilariously funny, in places. The humor is in the right places at the right times. Thriving on awkward humour at the expense of new age lifestyles and anxieties, it treads a fine line of endearingly goofy, unexpectedly incisive and plain weird. Short and sweet, Patrick Brice's foursome mumblecore The Overnight is disguised as a more accessible comedy, headlined by Adam Scott and Jason Schwartzman along with Taylor Schilling. Scott is great at playing the slightly neurotic everyman, and he explores his character's insecurities about his masculinity (or in Alex's words, his abnormally small dick) with his usual brand of self - deprecating charm."
8388,"Yet, much of the charm of People, Places, Things may be found in its ordinariness. People Places Things suffers from being obvious and stilted in a lot of places but it has a genuine heart at its core and a great sense of humor that makes it worth watching. What this film lacks in profundity, it makes up for in relatability and spirit raising adorableness that has the potential to appeal to a wide audience. A pleasantly accessible film with ample charisma and comedic talent, People, Places, Things is nothing more (or less! ) than an effortlessly funny, easy to watch and easy to like crowdpleaser."
8389,"Now the film feels and looks like the era with great costumes and set work. Hopefully all to soon be familiar faces; Johnny Simmons, Tye Sheridan, Brett Davern, and a guard with the most inventive choice of wording, Michael Angarano, all stick out among other strong performances. The Stanford Prison Experiment's wealth of strong material and performances are matched by its technical ambitions. It dwells too long on some of the most cruel moments and it's gonna make it hard to watch. On the experimenters end, Billy Crudup is perfect casting as Dr. Zimbardo."
8393,"Besides the set of Minnie's Haberdashery to recommend it, Quentin Tarrantino selected a truly fine ensemble cast who play beautifully off each other. This is the first real piece of cinema that has come to the theaters this year; with all the audacity, the balls, and the fearless will to show anything on screen that real filmmakers are brave enough to commit themselves to. Hateful Eight is another Tarantino masterpiece. The period is meaningful for the political currents that flow in nearly all the characters. There are a few nice shots showing snowy mountains, but 95% (perhaps more) of the story unfolds indoors (in one single room) - which isn't to say that the cinematography isn't absolutely fantastic."
8394,"The latter of which, yields a more tangible and heartwarming result, capable of conjuring a lasting tug at the heartstrings. Cara Delevigne the it girl from London pulls off a good accent. The credit for this goes to its equally - charming yet capable actors, both of whom teeming with fresh and enigmatic likability. This doesn't mean it's able to satisfy its own queries, but the resolution delivered are nonetheless, reliable and honest. Nat Wolff as Quentin (who does a neat "" Jimmy Stewart "" impression along the way) may one day fill the shoes of the iconic actor."
8395,"Not a masterpiece or anything but it works. Ms. Thirlby is very pretty and smart, making a mark despite her limited screen time. Sure, there are some scenes that were a bit predictable, but they still manage to be entertaining. A very positive and fun movie that will leave you with a big smile on your lips. They may have defining traits, but not one of them feels like a fleshed out character."
8396,"It is a fast - pace thriller with steamy love scenes and quick action sequences. One weekend, while Garrett and Kevin are away on a fishing trip, Claire accompanies her best friend and colleague, High School Vice Principal Vicky Lansing (Kristin Chenoweth of "" Strange Magic ""), on a blind date from Hell. Quite honestly, the only thing that was thrilling in this film were the end credits. It's funny though, the movie "" The Girl Next Door "" is about a beautiful and innocent closet porn star that maybe wants to get out of the business. This film bills itself as an erotic thriller."
8397,"Both performers do an excellent job. It's both beautiful and harrowing, aided by incredible performances. The best way to describe the flow of "" 45 Years "" is to liken it to a thawing. There are wide shots and close - ups alike, along with methodical zooms, giving the actors â€” especially Rampling â€” incredible space to work. Overall, "" 45 Years "" is an extremely simple film."
8398,"As moving and well - done "" Halt auf freier Strecke "" was, as forgettable is this one here."
8399,"The technical achievement of "" Victoria "" cannot be completely appreciated until the final credits roll. Other than of course the masterful camera work and direction, there's nothing absolutely spectacular to tell you to look out for--It's just a solid movie experience that provides a full spectrum of good acting, mystery, action, emotionally driven scenes backed by a great soundtrack. It happily unfolds itself as a genre transcending piece of cinema that often has unexpected moments of dark beauty hiding up its sleeve. Only really few risks were taken and some of them were pretty good E. g. "" Zeit der Kannibalen "", but for the most part they sucked. Other such films that have utilised similar techniques include "" Timecode "" (consisting of four separate but simultaneously continuous shots), "" Birdman: or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance "" (A. G. Inarritu's Oscar winning black comedy, edited to flow as one continuous take) and PVC - 1 (a Columbian film consisting of one 84 minute take)."
8403,"Pitch perfect , 4G networks, climate controlled cars, etc. . They even sometimes perfectly mirror moments from the first, fourth, and fifth movies nearly perfectly. There are a couple of amusing bits, especially when it has lowered your standard after a few scenes. Normally these spoof movies are really funny. It makes the little kids laugh, kind of like making noises with your armpit."
8405,"The most exciting scenes weren't all that exciting. The first thirty minutes is entertaining. Nothing is clear and the explanations are given vaguely and lamely. While it is impressive to watch, it doesn't contribute anything to the plot. HOWEVER, if you go in just expecting to be entertained and if you have a particular fondness for hustle movies, this is one enjoyable movie."
8406,"This is a simple and straightforward story, no major twists, not too much happening in terms of plot. The photography, both in winter and all seasons, is by BenoÃ®t Debie and the luminous musical score is by Alexandre Desplat. There are a lot of individual vignettes that are shown separately, without any real transition between some of them but those are intended to be seen as parallel to one another. Written by Bjorn Olaf Johannessen and enhanced by the strong original score by Alexandre Desplatt, Every Thing Will Be Fine, though very slow and ponderous at times, is a humane, poetic and physically beautiful film. 3 - D is used sparingly but scenes such as children riding on a Ferris wheel at an amusement park and dust particles dancing in the sun create a lovely tone."
8407,"It's beautifully filmed and the big set - pieces are a delight. Fabulous casting with every character a joy to watch and all of whom seem to be enjoying themselves immensely. The first film was a heart - warming experience, which reacquainted viewers with what good cinema should be about. In terms of the acting, there is nothing like a Dame and both Dench and Smith are once again excellent, displaying nuanced and â€“ particularly in Smith's case â€“ very moving performances. There are real, proper laughs, some fantastic one - liners and some very well done moments of pathos."
8409,"It's a pretty by - the - numbers movie of its type. The character relationships were, for the most part, believable. The movie shows really nice parkour action. If you are looking for a good parkour film, you're in luck and you should be pleased overall. The script brings entirely new dimensions to the concept of "" lame . """
8410,"Special recognition to the set designers who created a beautiful location for all the running sequences. What's surprising is the plethora of fabulous performances by the kids and townspeople in this terrific little TRUE story. The film is extremely pleasant and the story's roots in the real world lend credence to the inspirational message and underdog - overcoming - obstacles story. It was a rich assortment of landscapes that mesmerized the visual senses on BluRay. While the town is rather plain, the director did a great job of capturing the beautiful mountains and landscapes of the surrounding area."
8411,"In fact, it provoked some deep emotions. gosh his face expression is priceless: D Tom Wilkinson was fine same goes for most of the characters. This comedy is funny in parts and the cast is well chosen. Some good laughs, the naked people are pretty attractive, and Tom Wilkinson (who ISN'T naked in this film, thank goodness) is refreshingly funny in a rare comedic turn. Anyone can highbrow this film and put it down, but it has tangible qualities that do not make it and idiotic "" dumb & dumber "" type film."
8412,"There was great suspense with solid characters that you start to care about. Neeson is obviously charismatic, he isn't phoning it in, he is giving a heartfelt performance that definitely delivered. Honestly the acting by all characters was wonderful. The best part of "" Run All Night "" are the steely performances by Ed Harris and Joel Kinnaman. The action was Top Notch and continuous for about a good hour and twenty minutes out of a two hour movie."
8413,"Any later versions are remakes either good or just okay. It takes a better use of one's mind to create a movie (and remakes) like Cinderella and have it be successful and as well done as this film. The retelling of "" Cinderella "" (apparently known, in the 19th century, as "" Cinderslut "") with the benefits of modern techniques and processes is impeccable. It's pretty, has a good cast and has some nice tid - bits of humor here and there. True to Walt's original intentions, here is a film for all the family (well, some teenagers may want to wait a little)."
8414,"Nice scenes in Amsterdam and Paris. The scenes were definitely the saving moments for this film. At the high end, Jules Dassin's RIFIFI remains the unbeatable greatest caper movie of all time, and the various big - budget, in - joke titles like the original and update series of OCEAN'S ELEVEN are watchable. Most of the positives surround Hopkins, he gives a masterclass in acting, his performance is understated and yet believable. To top it off, the end text credits detailing the outcomes of the various characters (which can be found on wikipedia) were more interesting than most of the movie."
8417,"and also some edge - of - your seat moments. They had some really good jump scares! The living tree, the clowns (yes, multiple), the subterranean graveyard, etc. . particularly in the fact that they remade the movie at all, without adding anything clever to it. Although you should watch it if you're a true horror fan and you're looking for some good scares."
8418,"Its soundtracks are splendid, it simply doesn't let go. Graphical prowess plays important role, almost too much, and on its better parts Pan definitely has the stylish charm of fantasy vista. Its a bit darker then its predecessors, but is clearly shown that way through the trailer. Setting is filled with colorful designs and details, although CGI takes the helm on most cases. From subtle chimes, loud symphony and even shanty version of popular songs, the audio is brilliant."
8420,"People (and armies) showing up just at the perfect time (forgivable once, not around the 5th time). There are some decent scifi elements and even a couple of mildly intriguing moments. On the film's key moments, she undoubtedly shines, only her efforts aren't enough to place the movie's charm to the same level as hers. To conclude, lots of movies, even good ones, have clichÃ©s and information that you are just supposed to assume. Apparently, a lot of girls like overbearing assholes who think they know what is better for you."
8421,The lovely surprise is that the great singer Rihanna acts in it. It is a feel - good movie for all ages. Some movies entertain both the children and the adults. Home started feeling like a commercial for some Rihanna album or a very long music video. Home is exactly what the less - than - 7 reviews say it is.
8426,"This movies has perfectly shot, exciting, over the top - action. This should be watched for the stunts and CGI as both are terrific. The real winners in here are, of course, the stunts and CGI because they were terrific. The song choices were really good and they went along with the movie really well. And that Nathalie Emmanuel, holy gasoline fumes is she gorgeous."
8428,Muck is a lot of things. The marketing for the movie was really exciting and this is for sure one of those cases where something is hyped up and made to look watchable and when it comes out it's unbearable. It is one of these senseless films where there is poor dialogue and the acting could be so much better.
8432,"Etan Cohen's Direction is decent. Performance-Wise: Its good to see both, Will Ferrell & Kevin Hart, at their comedic best. Among others, the ever - dependable Craig T. Nelson, leaves a mark. But the characters did fit very well into the plot. Will Ferrell's character, James, has it all--beautiful fiancÃ©e, tons of money, lovely house."
8434,"Yes, both sorts are well - filmed. Rya Kihlstedt who plays Judith gives a brilliant and totally believable performance. "" You like to watch documentaries about the supernatural, alien sightings or other unexplained phenomena on "" National Geographic "", then you should see "" The Atticus institute "" since this is a documentary - style film about a scientific study in an institute led by Dr. Henry West."
8435,"It's a quaint atmosphere and presents a few lavish set pieces. The sets are decent and reminiscent of the time period. Thanks to producers by these 2h unforgettable. Good camera work and OK action scenes. Clive Owen was fantastic as he usually is in these type of roles, Morgan Freeman, again one of his better movies, and the supporting cast all very well acted."
8436,"Because despite everything: He can be pretty funny. The last two episodes are just breathtaking. Jarecki and his team did a wonderful job. Going from episode to episode one does not know what to expect; the surprises keep coming. Robert Durst is part of the Durst family, a prominent property investment force in New York."
8437,"Director Curtis and writer Alexi Kaye Campbell round off some of the rough edges and inject enough humor to prevent this from being the gut - wrenching process it probably was in real life. She was subtle and drove many of the scenes that required raw emotion. But the best movies also inform, educate, enlighten and uplift. Helen Mirren delivers yet another exceptional performance and manages to pull off the snappy lines without an ounce of schmaltz, while also capturing the emotional turmoil Ms. Altmann endures. The audience obviously did also, as there was laughter and applause at various spots."
8439,"The action scenes are neat and intense. The script, actors and directors captured the feeling of endless possibilities perfectly. The FX were fantastic, there were no lulls in the plot, George Clooney did his thing perfectly, the child actors were incredible, and there were just enough twists and turns to maintain the pace. It was bright and colourful with its showing of various technologies, from robots, jetpacks, lasers and a steampunk rocket. They managed to take that book and bring it up to date while making it accessible to all ages."
8442,"A word that embodies a person of strength, high moral value, extreme fortitude when it's comes to times of adversity, and the willingness to put oneself above others. With much excitement the Blarts are whisked away to Vegas to start their vacation. To his surprise Paul is welcomed to an all expenses paid Security Officers honors convention in none other than Sin City. 1 out of 10 edited by Samantha Locke twitter: @FatMikeTPK facebook page: https: / / www. A wiggling bowl of gelatin, Blart is a comic masterpiece."
8443,"This is the latest of the DisneyNature films and it retains the finest qualities of the previous features: amazing photography, stirring music, and enjoyable narration. If you are familiar with DisneyNature films, you know that the credits at the end are an integral part of enjoying the film. It is amazing that even though they are monkeys, they still have a social hierarchy. There are crises as well as tender moments but the food hunting scenes were especially wonderful. But the real treat here is seeing how the life and system of monkeys isn't so different from the way that human beings are governed - by a strict ruling class that leads on fear and the enforcement of conformity costs."
8444,"Excellent performances, a truly poignant story. The costumes, sets and everything that goes into bringing the past eras to life is done with precise detail. Each age is well designed, makeup, costumes, and scenery all well combined to bring the world to life. The costumes are so fun to watch. Through a series of fantastic phenomena, she has remained as a 29 year old for eight decades."
8445,"He sinks his teeth into the part & brings it out with flying colors. Bobby Cannavale is in fine form, as well. Englebert Humperdinck sprung to mind a few times whilst watching this. Among the best films from 2015 yet! If that's the case, this is fine film to see, especially if you're only planning on seeing one, maybe two, films this year."
8455,"There are rich visual metaphors throughout which support a fully animated subtext. Kleiman also shows enough to suggest his future endeavors could be quite the treat and the films soundtrack by Daniel Lopatin (aka Oneohtrix Point Never) is easily one of the year's best. All elements of this film are superb, including the acting and the directors gradual unravelling of the pervasive ambivalence in relationships is masterful. A unique Australian backed effort with moments of genuine greatness, Partisan has wins but far far too many losses to compensate for. The actors all seem to be unknowns but all do brilliant jobs of what was a very physical film in terms of what is expected."
8446,"Combine that with friends loyal because of their mutual possessions and heavy bank accounts, and you have a girl who is mean and nasty because she simply doesn't have any true people in her life she can connect to - and the one she had has now become her worst enemy. If people actually pay attention, bullies are mean - hearted people that love taking advantage of people. Now to just watch it all play out for an hour and ten minutes. Lexi Ainsworth was very believable as the bullied Jessica. The much - anticipated, highly - publicized documentary Bully in 2011, while effective on some levels, left audience with little insight into the bulliers."
8447,"Wow, what a breath of fresh air in the cesspool of recent films (okay, a few other exceptions . ) An enlightening and moving film that garners big laughs and big tears; Paul Weitz has created the crowning work of his career. In another enriched turn, Oscar - winner Marcia Gay Harden delivers her best work since "" Mystic River . "" With a career that's been as impressive as his, with a turn as memorable as he delivers, Elliott should be among the conversation for Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars. As with many relationship break - ups, the tone shifts quickly with an increase in' let's talk about it'."
8449,"The story line and plot wasn't anything spectacular. It's all spectacle and no substance, and the spectacle's nothing to write home about because the special effects are nothing you haven't seen before in other superior disaster movies. Ray is solid as a rock, he's something sturdy, like a real man, someone you can cling to or hold on to no matter what. Forget the millions of Californians who died or were dying along the way. This is a perfect example of Hollywood, being Hollywood and should be avoided by anyone who's been hollywooded before, which is anyone watching this kind of crap over the last several decades."
8452,"Nothing else ""), class division, complicated loves, Far offers a heroine, Bathsheba (well - cast, crooked smiling Mulligan) far ahead of her time (See the above quote). This is a love affair long in the making, beginning ten years ago with her startling presence in Bleak House at the age of 20 (looking much, much younger); her stunning minx - like Dr Who performance as Sally Sparrow in "" Blink ""; and on through her breakout movie performance in "" An Education "" in 2009. The Belgian - born Schoenaerts speaks flawless English with no hint of a foreign inflection, although it is noticeable that, unlike Bates, he does not attempt a West Country accent. Carey Mulligan plays Ms. Everdene, and she is exceedingly independent and ambitious for the time period, while simultaneously being attractive in a more timeless manner. The obvious right guy for her is farmer Gabriel Oak (Matthias Schoenaerts), whose steadfast love for the heroine could only be compared to Job's suffering."
8453,"Bach choreographs and executes the action with gory flair, and fans of the IO Interactive game will be glad to know that he makes the effort to retain its aesthetics. Anyone who's ever harboured the dream of seeing Singapore feature prominently in a Hollywood movie will certainly be pleased with' Hitman: Agent 47 "", which features iconic landmarks such as Gardens by the Bay and Marina South in their full glory. If you want to see a decent movie about Agent 47, watch "" Hitman "", starring Timothy Olyphant. Given he's contrasted, directly, against John Smith (Zachary Quinto) who does the exact same thing, it leaves the viewer with an interesting conundrum as to whether anything they're seeing from them is true. The action scenes are, of course, the only reason anyone should go see this movie and they don't disappoint."
8454,"Ricky and the Flash could have been a good movie, all the bits were there - a variety of personas, all with flaws, back stories, conflicts and interests. A few gems have successfully combining music and drama without being a musical, especially "" Once . "" It also helps that Cody knows her strong suits, which are complex characters with a lot of emotions yet no really clear - cut idea of how to express such emotions. Easy to see the genes working well together. The story felt more like a Disney Channel Movie than anything else."
8457,"Pitch Perfect was hilarious, charming, original, and had great performances. Indeed they are a nice balance to the melodramatic aspect of the movie, grounded to the real stakes of this world. MOVIE, The funny scenes and everything was great. Pitch Perfect 2 is just as much fun as the first one. Moreover, new girls fit right into the dynamic of the group."
8459,"They are always perfect of course, but here there's something one of a kind about their performances. Beautifully photographed, designed, edited, scored and acted, there's no reason to give it anything less than full marks. Lots of lingering, carefully framed shots and closeups. Both undoubtedly gave two of the best performances of the year. Its charming, important, powerful, resonant, and features two one of kind performances."
8460,"The style is pleasant and interesting, despite some nasty moments. Camera movements are fluid, colour hues wonderfully compliment its overcast ambiance and lighting seems natural for the most part. There are constant references and reminders to how even numbers are perfect, a couple. So, the performances, the directing, the writing, and pretty much everything is stunning, apart from one big issue that prevents this from being a truly incredible film. Rachel Weisz is also spot - on as the short - sighted woman."
8461,"The technical traits of "" Maggie "" are spot on for the most part thanks to director Hobson. In spite of it's strangeness, it's better than anything he's done lately, and shows a more mature and emotional side developing after so many years. Echoing the moods of hard - hitting films but with the charisma of any entertaining blockbuster you would see this summer. Movie is 90 minutes long and destined to be a cult classic. Maggie is an interesting and unique approach to a subject that is often glossed over in other zombie - related stories, and the quieter moments are the ones that resonate the most."
8462,"Plenty of gags, good laughs and even some girl on girl action which was hilarious. Also there are some really good plot twists that will catch you by surprise. Concerning the stunning Reese Witherspoon, she is indeed a great actress. Overall its a really fun movie that will put you in a good mood and give you some good laughs. Reese Witherspoon and Sofia Vergara are talented and funny when given the opportunity."
8463,"As for the gore there are two decent scenes. Fans of this series loved the first two movies because they were very dark and twisted. Under threats of termination by the Governor, his loyal right hand man Dwight comes up with a brilliant idea. Yes chaps you read that right - Eric Roberts probably gives the most calm, rational and realistic acting performance in the entire movie. A revolutionary idea which could change the American prison system for good and save billions of dollars."
8517,"Director Antoine Fuqua effectively wrung all the right emotions out of this story. This was truly an acting tour de force by Gyllenhaal which simply cannot be ignored. And yet, through Antoine Fuqua's sensitive direction, Kurt Sutter's punchy dialogue and some excellent performances, Southpaw somehow transcends its own generic limitations. The fight scenes were well - choreographed and executed on screen--very brutal, bloody, all with high tension. The acting was great throughout the film especially by Gyllenhaal and, surprisingly, Oona Laurence was fantastic."
8464,"Since the first act establishes that Damon is so well set up he doesn't actually need rescuing, Ridley Scott fabricates a second act 'em ergency' in a vain attempt to raise tension (it doesn't). Damon is consistently likable, which is just as well since he is alone in the vast majority of his scenes. As a result everything seems to be explained with everyday objects, and even the most complex principles are presented in simple terms (references to Iron Man for instance). He still has potatoes to eat, and he still, presumably, shits occasionally, so he has all the ingredients he used the first time. As a result the film gets to have its cake and eat it â€“ although the film is helped by the knowledge of a lot of this being possible (eg hitting a point near Pluto recently with very tight tolerances on a journey of years)."
8465,"Return to Sender is reasonably well - filmed too and fits the atmosphere well with some nice shots. It started out at a good pace; interesting, good acting, liked the characters, it seemed to be going good. Overall, messy (with the biggest offender being the story) and a missed opportunity, with its moments (the performances of Pike, Nolte and Fernandez, some nice shots and a decent first act). Powerfully rich in dramatic pain and torment, rape and its aftermath had been the topic of thousands of films and TV shows. "" Johnny Belinda "" (1948) and "" The Accused "" (1988) have won Best Actress Oscars for Jane Wyman and Jodie Foster respectively."
8466,"It has everything as a reference : 1. Awesome in everything and just simply a great ride! It was a Kickstarter project from a filmmaker who had a vision of greatness. The characters are very different, they are both interesting well maybe more strange at times, but also fun and has their own characteristics and special powers. The pacing works brilliantly, the soundtrack fits perfect with the action and theme, and the special effects is really high class."
8467,"GMT and UTC are the same thing for practical purposes. Had a lot of expectations due to Pierce coming in as a villain and that too with a deadly look. Milla Jovovich is a decent actress but much of her role involves reacting to situations with close ups of shock / surprise. Pacing is an even bigger issue coming from James McTeigue, the same director responsible for the fantastic V For Vendetta. Pierce Brosnan did an admirable job with the material that he was given, evoking the same ice cold villain persona that he had perfected in such films as "" The Fourth Protocol "" and "" Don't Talk to Strangers ""."
8468,"Melissa McCarthy can be a funny, talented actor but she seems to have to resort in playing parts where she uses extremely vulgar language making her look untalented, seamy and stupid. As far as lead performances go, this is the funniest Melissa McCarthy has ever been. Miranda Hart and Jude Law do good with there performances though Jude feels like more of a plot device. His rants are comedy gold simply because it's Statham doing them. Melissa McCarthy's rants are hysterically funny as is her unbelievable' spy mode'!"
8469,"Having said that; these kinds of movies can and have been saved by good performances. Much has been said about the talented lead performers, and they have done decent work in previous endeavors. Lebron James is a big surprise. It's stunning how endlessly stupid movies can be. Hader was good, as were most of the actors, apart from the product placement sports stars."
8470,"And, the cast is stellar: Bradley Cooper, Emma Stone, John Krasinski, Alec Baldwin, Bill Murray, and so many other top performances. First, Rachel McAdams plays her character perfectly, and it's a well - drawn character. Rachael McAdams is adorable as always. There was one neat foreshadowing scene that led up to an interaction between Brian Gilcrest, played by Bradley Cooper, and Woody Woodside, played by John Krasinski. Set in the magnificent and mystical landscapes of Hawaii, with the soothing backdrop of lilting Hawaiian music, it's simply unforgettable!"
8489,"The whole thing is so bland that the leery voice of Young Gru (Steve Carrell) right at movie's end was such a welcomed relief - at last (and alas it was the end) a little promise of inventive fun With a comedic edge the film will probably keep you laughing for ages. Perhaps it served as a confidence booster for the gump - like, slack jawed, troglodytes that were the target audience. Also some of the human characters had some great line and some great physical comedy but otherwise a generic kids flick. Some of the negatives are that throughout this film the Minion Bob is their to act like a 6 year old being dragged on this adventure with some of the most kid friendly humor since Matter from Cars 2."
8472,"What Thornton and Osment really bring to the movie is a reality check. It's an hour and a half of the gang up to their usual antics, and it's a boatload of fun. A kind of celebration of Entourage, with cameos all over the place - fun to watch. It was these moments where Entourage felt more like a movie. The best aspects of the series fall by the wayside while the worst aspects get retread and amplified (like the Eric and Sloan on / off thing again, really? )"
8473,"Riley is brilliantly sympathetic throughout, even with her difficult mood swings, and the supporting characters are perfectly entertaining. The 1 star reviews are almost laughable about how inaccurate they are. The movie had lots of promotion on TV and Disney Channel where kids mainly go to see the exciting movies coming to a theatre near them. Like in Snow White the emotions have names matching that of their personality. Pixar did not please its intended audience, nor did it please the grown ups."
8474,"It's at once extremely funny, with their cardboard guns and baggy suits, yet haunting in the same sense. Their movie scenes are fun to watch, especially given their Tarantino leanings with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Well, they watched a ton of movies and would re-enact them on camera verbatim with incredible and complex homemade props and costumes. The story of their lives is incredibly gripping, and absolutely worthy of this skillfully - made film. Their saving grace has been their movie addiction, wherein they re-enact scenes from famous films such as Reservoir Dogs and The Dark Knight."
8476,"She is perfect as Katniss and really understands her character well. The twist at the end is so well signposted that it doesn't take much inferring leaving the happy ever after. This is definitely the case with Mockingjay Part 2, the thrilling and emotional conclusion of the franchise. Jennifer Lawrence returns, for one last time, as Katniss Everdeen, the main protagonist. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 is a film without any artistic integrity."
8477,"He shared the screen well with the other actors. The cartoony animation was absolutely great and made the characters fit in well with the real world. The CGI for all the animated game characters was awesome. It's a kids movie which has a lot of appeal for adults. This movie was very well made, graphics were great, and the story line and characters were fun to watch and kept you involved throughout the movie."
8456,"Real science fiction for real science fiction fans. This film borrows a lot from classic sci fi horror movies, you get some of the tech from alien, a little bit of Event Horizon, and has the claustrophobia of The Thing. The sets created for the bleak space station were very impressive. You don't really know at the start, but the movie takes its own twist which will be fun for sci fi fans. The movie pulls you into its world, the storyline was plausible as far as futuristic sci fi's goes, the characters kept you engaged and you felt for them as they struggled."
8490,"2: The characters are heartwarming, and the plot is simple. It's the core of the emotional artistry that movies are meant to be. The characters' texture and form have been reduced and that of the environment increased. The scene near the end where Arlo lets Spot go and join his new family was really really touching. All in all it is better than Planes and a little bit less than Wreck it Ralph."
8482,"Robert (Ferrell) and Sarah (Wiig) are happily married and expecting a new baby. That's why Wiig and Ferrell were keen on doing this. To give Wiig and Ferrell a bit of fun. There are lines and scenarios that are very funny, such as referring to the main couple's daughter's condition: "" You know the dangers of diabetic ketoacidosis! "" She has a wild mix of credits, from Asylum movies (Sherlock Holmes, to tie in with the 2009 movie) to actual TV movies of this ilk (Escape from Polygamy) and more recent comedy work."
8483,"Lots of action scenes, really well directed, the effects were great too. A welcome treat among so many scripts that tend to walk the line of "" the ridiculously over the top . "" It does have some good action scenes, and great sci - fi element. It's a thoughtful cerebral thriller with the fat trimmed away, it doesn't linger in too many places. There were enough surprises and plenty of intrigue to keep you wondering."
8484,"Considering all that, TLWH, is doing it's job very nicely. One of the neatest places was that bar with the subtle light magic. The effects and scenes are beautifully created and shot. Further, he finds that Dolan 36th is still alive under a powerful spell. They seem to be well - choreographed with the exemplary sound effects bringing the fight scenes to life."
8488,"Amanda Seyfried fits in with these two so well and as a trio they really mesh well together. And there were a lot of good laughs in this movie. Enter Sam L. Jackson (Amanda Seyfried) and yes as you would expect there are many references to the Hollywood star. Good one - liners, and good recurring gags. First off, the negative reviews are absolutely LAUGHABLE!"
8491,"Interestingly, all of these good scenes are just spice to the meat of the film. Not that a counterfeit of something great can't still have its positives: the score is beautiful and the performances from the top - notch cast around Depp are nearly as superb as his, all of whom nail the oft - parodied Bostonian accent with aplomb. ' Black Mass' has the look of a 70s television show, and that works in its favor. This is the type of the film that makes you want more and more after each scene is done all the way towards the end, and the supporting characters really help Black Mass reach its full potential of hitting the right spots for a moviegoer. As an adaptation of the best - selling book of the same name by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill, the film portrays the key years of Bulger's ascent to power in the Boston crime world, during which he acted as an FBI - informant through slick FBI agent (and Southie homeboy) John Connolly (Joel Edgerton)."
8492,"Nicely played by Daniel Craig, this is his fourth entry, first was Casino Royale, following Quantum of solace and Skyfall. The man gets little to work with, as did Javier Bardem in the last one - criminally underused, awesome actors. Nice entry stars Daniel Craig as the tough, two - fisted James Bond who takes on nasty organization nicknamed Spectra with a octopus - like symbol. All the interesting plot developments from Casino Royale and (and even Quantum of Solace to some extent), such as Bond's emotional state after losing Vesper and the Quantum organization, are chucked out the window. Sam Mendes and John Logan apparently came to the conclusion that it was time to bring back one of the most crucial ingredients for Bond's success with audiences over the years: the fun."
8493,"Ziering and Reid offers decent performances and of course there's some wink cameos throughout. The c. g. is bad, the story is ridiculous, the acting is cheesy but the movie is fun. Ryan Newman was brought in as a recast, and she absolutely nails her part. Add in smaller cameos from Chris Jericho, Jerry Springer, Lou Ferigno (who has a great Hulk - referencing line) and even have Mark Cuban come on to play the president and this film is chalk full of amazing casting. Frankie Muniz, Ryan Newman, David Hasselhoff, Mark Cuban and Bo Derek join the cast; which also has returning cameos from Matt Lauer and Al Roker, plus many new ones (including notorious conservatives like Ann Coulter and Michele Bachmann)."
8497,"The film has a great cast who give solid performances. Fortunately, the whole cast makes an exceptional work, transcending those tricks and bringing fluid and absolutely credible performances. She brought the character alive in full force and truly demonstrated she is one of the best actresses working. ' Steve Jobs' is another fine example of his talents. Truth be told this movie has everything needed to build a classic and uses it remarkably."
8499,"If you love raunchy and dirty humor and you loved the original Vacation movies, then you will love and enjoy this comedy film. There are several scenes which pay homage to the original Vacation movie which was great to see. If you need escapism from the daily grind and are not in the mood to over-think anything, this is a good movie for you. "" Vacation "" strikes a great balance between honoring its iconic origins and paving its own holiday road. The new fictional Griswolds are brought closer together by their trip and the cinematic portrayal of their misadventures is both fun & funny"
8556,"A great new spin on the usual offerings within this genre and well worth an evenings viewing. This film enhances things on a larger, more corporate scale, citing sources for all the ugliness and increasing the stakes which, for horror films in particular, is ripe for implausibility and complete exaggeration of something that once worked so well because it was so simple. Contracted was a very methodical horror film; conservatively paced, but always interesting from a situational standpoint, England always found a way to connect you with the character at hand and knew how to make the audience wince at the grotesque moments on - screen. They actually followed the story, quite nicely too, linked some pieces together, showed a better and more complex plot that leads to a good ending. And there are some really good scenes with zombies and police officers and you can see how the disease spreads so easily."
8503,"Delineation of conflicts: The reception in Baton Rouge was lovely. Rosaria had moved to a new job in Florida. Danny Trejo carried the movie quite well, and he did make the movie bearable to watch. Yes this film is predictable and the C. G. is very cheesy but it's a low beget and it adds to the charm. Well depending on how you liked the first two movies, you can expect to feel the same here."
8505,"The contrast between the Amy of the early years to the one latterly seen is pretty pronounced. The very first moments of the film are almost worth the ticket price. "" Amy "" The Amy Winehouse Documentary is brilliant. It certainly makes a nice change from the numerous camera interviews, mixed with footage of the documentary's subject. On the one hand, it does a fantastic job of showing her fun - loving and upbeat personality in the years before the health problems started, and it really gives you a lasting image of a completely different Amy Winehouse to the one that almost lived in infamy towards the end of the 2000s."
8507,"well, it was a grueling hour and 55 minutes sitting through it. But the film does treat both sexes with equal disdain: men are sexual objects and women are sex crazed nymphs. They all agree that rehearsing and performing in thongs was a true bro boding experience and make fun of their junk and blah blah blah. The sordidness of male strippers is on the back burner as this film version celebrates the legitimacy of male dancers as a serious art form. Their moves well choreographed and fluid."
8509,"Guy Ritchie's direction is assured and far more clever and entertaining than his current rivals. Grant adds a bit of star recognition to the film but comes across as rather likable with well timed appearances. Sherlock movies then you will thoroughly enjoy this. Guy Ritchie's trademark is everywhere on this film, from the stylish sets, to the retro fashion. The jabs at fictional representations of espionage are delivered with near perfect timing."
8510,"Kit Harington does a great job, not acknowledging (with his acting) that he is playing in a comedy. So many things about this movie are incredible. How unexpected some of the things are in this movie is what makes it so funny. The unexpected cameos in this movie are incredible. There are a ton of LOL moments."
8511,"Two examples from recent cinematic history come to mind. The Walk is a 2015 American 3D biographical drama film directed by Robert Zemeckis and written by Christopher Browne and Zemeckis. Creating movies like that take a tremendous amount of skill. This was truly an amazing cinematic experience that was made for IMAX 3D. The Walk is a stylish and entertaining look at one of the biggest artistic feats of the last century, and you need to watch it in IMAX 3D."
8513,"Spend your time and money on other films, like' It Follows' which came out this year a way better psychological horror or even Insidious 3 where they have much better intense moments."
8516,"It is true that it solved all problems at once, though no one will live happily ever after. For three, the three leads are brilliantly cast and played. For two, Khondji's cinematography is an absolute afternoon delight. All this would have been better to digest when there was some humor intertwined within the proceedings. But it's far from his best, although his work - ethic is remarkable, along with the fact that he isn't guilty of missing the mark or making poor movies, even when he's coasting."
8518,"it's very understated with a lot of it consisting of looks. All three performances are absolutely fantastic and among the best of the year. Benicio Del Toro is downright magnificent. It is so in you face, so tight, it really contributes in making you feel a part of this even in the more intimate scenes. Emily Blunt, as seen in nearly everything she touches, shows herself as one of the most interesting and endearing actresses working today."
8519,"' Best of Enemies' is more than nostalgia, it is a palimpsest for the soul of the American soul. "" BEst of Enemies "" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! "" Best of Enemies "" is incredibly effective at achieving multiple thematic ends without coming off as dense. There's little reference to the major events that surrounded the conventions nor is there any real explanation about the mechanics behind the conventions themselves and why they're so interesting by today's standards. These debates are chronicled in the powerful documentary Best of Enemies directed by Robert Gordon ("" Johnny Cash's America "") and Morgan Neville ("" Twenty Feet From Stardom "")."
8520,"But the overall script needed more risks into a wider range of bizarre and weird images that are capable within this animated genre. It's upsetting, certainly, but Anomalisa offers a real insight into the human soul and makes a lasting impression. But it isn't until he finally hears a different voice in the form of Lisa Hesselman (Jennifer Jason Leigh) that he finally awakens to life and all of its wondrous possibilities. The look of the movie and the puppets is fantastic, and Carter Burwell provides yet another spot - on score. In "" Anomalisa, "" his Academy - Award nominated animated film, David Thewlis and especially Jennifer Jason Leigh do tremendous voice work as an emotionally ill minor celebrity and the shy, awkward woman with whom he enjoys a one - night stand while at a conference at which he is the speaker."
8522,"It was lovely to see ageism front and center, blasted to smithereens! Subtle, believable performances that did not pander to the problems of aging, but acknowledged them. How a guy who played such ruthless characters in "" Goodfellas "" and "" Taxi Driver "" can pull off this avuncular gentlemen is a testament to his craft. His Ben Whittaker almost seems too perfect, but DeNiro brings a humanity that makes him eminently believable. It's hard to find a movie that is respectable and clean, with charm and wit, one that is suitable for thinking adults."
8523,"it is admirable that activists should attempt to offer them ways out, that much may be said for even the odious Catharine Mackinnon. She makes an interesting character: her style of speaking has its similarities to that of evangelical preachers, although she appears completely genuine in her message combining self - forgiveness and practical help. It is noteworthy that almost all the women who speak herein claim to have been raped or otherwise sexually abused, mostly as children, even a former pimp claims to have been sexually assaulted - he became lovers with his aunt! The women running the program - ex prostitutes - are doing the best they can to rescue some of the victims and to prevent children from descending into this hellish lifestyle."
8524,"His wide eyes and expressive thoughts are very believable, and when he sees the outside world for the first time, it's a thing of beauty. Of the supporting cast, Joan Allen & The Always Solid William H. Macy leave a solid mark. The entire film is seen through the eyes of this child, and it's genius. Jack Trembley gave one of the most, if not the most, impressive performances of the year. Performance-Wise: Brie Larson & Jacob Tremblay deliver incredible performances."
8525,"The plot is decent, all actors did a good job and you can immediately relate to the main characters. Also, it's a pretty precise sketch of not only how how the politics work, but also how a lot of relationships work. So if you are looking for something with a lot of digital effects, this is not a good film for you, look for something else. People love to bash Nic Cage films, and clearly a lot of people will bash this one simply because of that. It's an interesting look on how politics work and the necessaries of certain evils and how that works."
8526,"The three leads are also so fantastic. Like the best thrillers, The Gift evolves naturally and realistically. His delivery and conviction here is very strong, as he deadlocks his eyes into Hall and digs into her, himself, and everything that occurred in the past in one great scene. The performances here are unanimously strong, particularly from Bateman, who gives one of his only very serious roles to date here. The Gift is a surprisingly well - crafted and intense thriller film that feels like a throwback to the best 90's stalker flicks."
8528,"While Game of Thrones alumni Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie offer brilliantly raw performances as the family's mother and father, it's the film's younger actors â€” Harvey Scrimshaw and Anya Taylor - Joy â€” who really shine. The story is mediated through phenomenal performances that are the real emotional center of the film, while rare but fantastical occurrences with the supernatural jar the audience as much they do the family. "" The Witch "" lives in that territory as a horror movie for cinephiles, not for audiences who love the thrill of a good scare. The family's dealings with the supernatural terror in the woods push their spiritual and physical endurance to the breaking point. The performances are explosive, the tension is gut - wrenching, and the settings are nightmarish."
8529,"The idea that the' grandparents' were mental patients who had escaped seemed pretty self explanatory from the start. It has echoes of Signs, The Village and The Sixth Sense. Part of this is self - inflicted, because he has refused to veer from the "" M. Night Shyamalan "" formula: modern fairy tale crafted to take an unexpected turn approximately two - thirds into the fun. Shyamalan is really back and this screenplay is the best thing he's ever written since the sixth sense and unbreakable. The young boy, "" Tyler "" (played by Ed Oxenbould), will quickly become a favorite in this film with his various remarks, "" swearing "", and "" skills ""."
8530,"The cool premise and individual moments of fun can't overcome how poorly executed the final product is. The design is extremely stylish and even nobly unique, but underneath those flairs of fun is one of the most identity - confused films ever, a true mess of genres and tones that never quite finds its footing. Jesse Eisenberg nails the role of stoner perfectly. What could've been an inventive little comedy ala Scott Pilgrim or Zombieland is an ultra-mess. For a lighthearted film, there were a few moments that definitely pulled on the heartstrings."
8531,"Quick, let's bury the good reviews! If that was meant to change things, well Sirs, screw you! Great performances by actors who looks a lot like the original group, as well as Paul Giamatti. Because of theming this advantageous fact, usually these kinds of movies reaches the box office success in a short time (The Recent Example is The Wolf of Wall Street). In addition to that, if you choose real biographic characters who live in ghettos and climbing the huge wall of the world's top in a while, definitely sell."
8532,"Then Kretzer shows up and the tension builds and builds. An exciting feature, hard to believe they packed so much in under 90 minutes. Fourthly, it's a rather well photographed and scored affair, with the sparse Colorado plains scenery shot nicely in widescreen. The story simple, only three characters to concentrate on - and very real. It has well - handled suspense and characters you actually care about."
8544,"Unexpected tender moments in the midst of insane street life. There is even a scene in Razmik's cab featuring veteran actor Clu Gulager ("" The Virginian ""), and Armenian celebrity Arsen Grigoryan plays another taxi driver. Many individual scenes are funny, while others are tension - filled. The acting throughout is strong and humanistic, and the iPhone photography is shocking in its depth and range Finally, what you see are human beings with the same, or even better, values that you have."
8607,"This series was thought provoking, filled with intrigue and at times terrifying. You will find two major types of reviews in here : 1. This is one of the best documentaries ever created and a must - watch for everybody. It's hard to put into words how moving this documentary series was. But even the most reasonable, even skeptical viewer will have to grapple with the theories put forward."
8548,"Carey Mulligan, who somehow didn't seem to get the period right in the remake of FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD, is at her absolute best here, utterly convincing as an oppressed working mother reluctantly drawn into the campaign to give women fairer pay and a voice in the governance of the realm. Meryl Streep has brief but commanding appearances as cranky old Mrs Pankhurst, imperiously redirecting her campaign from the ruling class to the working class. Even lovely Ben Whishaw was nasty. Helena Bonham Carter is quite surprisingly good as Edith Ellyn, especially in a sequence where she and her co - conspirators plan to blow up a private property constructed for Lloyd George's personal pleasure. Stepping in for the latter at an important consultation with a UK Government committee on votes for women, she finds herself, initially unwillingly, drawn into activism on behalf of the cause."
8549,"The production, story and acting are all as good, if not better than, any other movie you'd expect to see in the theaters. The brothers who directed this movie and others have vastly improved over the previous films. Sharper than any double - edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. This film was only slightly cheesy a times, but given it's PG rating this may have been to add humor or some element the whole family could react to in some sections. Unlike many Christian themed movies on television, which are lacking in many ways, this movie is well worth watching."
8550,"The story of the Kray twins is a fascinating one, full of violence and deceit. A note however for the sensitive viewer: this is a very (very) violent film in places, and a couple of the scenes in particular are hard to watch. It is true that glasses and change of hairdo can actually produce a different personality. The amazing special effects make the dual show possible, but within minutes of the start here, you completely forget that these two characters are played by the same man. The twins are total individuals, totally two people."
8551,"you have "" Deathgasm "", a movie that is both dark and hilarious, with over-the-top gore and some questionable sexual references (but never offensive, just uproarious). Directed by Jason Lei Howden, who clearly knows his music and his horror, Deathgasm owes a lot to the splatter classics of Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson, his film possessing a similarly energetic and madcap style. The amount of slashed body parts and the inventive ways they use to do it is just hilarious. As a film, DEATHGASM has plenty to recommend it, not least the quality of the gruesome special effects which are very good. The Demons resemble Deadites from Evil Dead 2, which this movie clearly pays homage to among other several horror movies (most notable, Braindead)."
8552,"Performance-Wise: Eddie Redmayne as Lili Elbe & Alicia Vikander as Gerda Wegener, deliver brilliant performances. ' The Danish Girl' salutes the courageous lives of Lili Elbe & Gerda Wegener. ' The Danish Girl' is A fictitious love story inspired by the lives of Danish artists Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener. Alexandre Desplat's Score is enchanting. THE DANISH GIRL isn't a masterpiece but it's certainly a very good movie with some excellent performances."
8553,"The catalyst of the whole plot works perfectly and the characters who are set up brilliantly in the first ten minutes work wonderfully in this environment. It's a great idea, and it definitely works for most movies. and the score complete some moments at the movie. A lot of horror / thriller movies use that concept in one variation of another. It's a white knuckle thrillfest, and one that pits a lump in your stomach from the intensity witnessed on screen."
8555,"Both of these performances are simply excellent. Like any fighters, they must advance into deadly danger. The children acting in this movie are amazing, it is one of the best movies where a child grabs your attention. The writing is fantastic as you see the war through Agu's eyes, and it's not pretty. A must see and one of the many reasons to go and get a Netflix account!"
8560,"Seth Rogen is a rather intelligent producer. seth rogen is, well, seth rogan. The performances are great, and the script is brilliant. Why can't anyone actually articulate anything beyond the most basic grunting sounds? It re-teams Rogen with Joseph Gordon - Levitt and director Jonathan Levine (the trio last worked together on 2011's' 50/50')."
8561,"Everything about this film is brilliant. This is particularly true for Ruffalo and McAdams. McAdams performance is award worthy and Ruffalo is fully engaged in a role that matches his talents. Mark Ruffalo was amazing in this film, and Rachel McAdams was superb. Each bring strong sensibilities and sensitivity to their roles that desperately call for them."
8563,"Bradley Cooper who's in pretty much everything these days, is all will as Jones. After punishing himself by shucking oysters back in the states (1 , 000 , 000 to be exact), Jones then ventures to Europe once again, this time sober and clean. And most of the scenes themselves were well acted, Bradley seemed invested in the role. Shot at a whirlwind running time of just over 100 minutes, Burnt registers former drug addict / cooking aficionado, Adam Jones (Cooper). The pace of the film is right and there are some great natural performances especially from the chameleon actress Sienna Miller and the always serious Daniel "" Nikki Lauda "" BrÃ¼hl."
8564,"The voice acting was stunning and honestly this lovely film is worth seeing for all ages, you will move into another fantastic world for 90 minutes. Go see it, even if you don't have kids, it's a fun, easy - going flick that's sure to make you jiggle with joy like Blobby. There's also new character additions to the cast, which is great although sometimes it can sink a film if it becomes over saturated. More monster characters, more amusing moments and more exciting parties have upgraded an additional star rating for the hotel this Halloween season. This "" cute "" moment under cuts the entire message of the film."
8565,"Serious' Hard' Science Fiction, well done, beautifully conceptualized. The cinematography was also very good with some nice shots of futuristic looking buildings from different countries in contrast with some rather stark UK interior shots. Imagine a future, where the majority of citizens are not only using, but encouraged to do so though advertising and product guarantees. The boy is particularly good in his role, and although not really having much experience in heavy duty acting, he really did an outstanding job, especially in his scenes with his screen Dad. Hate being hard on a movie - regardless of budget, it is still someone's creative sweat equity - but this is a real stinker But if you are suffering from insomnia."
8566,"When he's given the right material, he soars higher than most actors ever dream of reaching, and he finds the regret, sympathy, coldness and wounded spirit mentality of Ashby. Ashby needs a driver, and the two strike an amiable enough relationship that's both tragically funny and a sly statement on the addled nature of youths today. Rourke's cowboy machismo and brooding vibe of danger is genius and takes on a whole new light when contrasted with the bright, idiosyncratic realm of the low key indie dramedy. It's a perfect concoction of ingredients, a melding of today's millennial teen angst with the battle scarred remnants of 1990's gritty pulp fare. Although the depth of the characters is left shallow, the storyline is well done."
8568,"Munich captures the violence of the Middle East 70s with revere, respect, and revelation. In the final analysis, it's a buddy film with some period costumes and a somewhat poignant conclusion. Bridge of Spies, starts him off so normal and then turns his life into quite an adventure. And at the same time the Coens aren't necessarily making it' Coens - y', in a manner of speaking; they serve their filmmaker extremely well, giving a light air to a good number of scenes in a way that keeps the tension and suspense in a good balance. Between the two though, Bridge of Spies is the more serious affair, and certainly Spielberg has a lot thematically on his plate."
8569,"He has a strong supporting cast in the very attractive Piper Perabo, Michaela McManus, Thomas Jane, and of course the great Scott Glenn and Billy Bob Thornton. Bart the Bear (II) did a fine job with what he had to work with. The actors did decent enough jobs. Just sit back and relax its a great film, there are worse things to do with your time for ninety minutes. The location scenery and setting is fantastic, and there's some grizzly scenes (no pun intended) of hard to watch dead bear cubs, body dismemberment and so on."
8570,"The characters seem real, and the performances are excellent, especially from the lead, Logan Marshall - Green. They are going to live healthy and happy lives for the next 40 or 50 years. It overflows with unnecessarily jumpy flashbacks and blurred memories in an effort to appear mysterious. 15 minutes of Luke warm action that you thought would happen earlier in the movie finally trickles out. Which, instead of being sprung on you hoping to leave a lasting impression, is instead gradually introduced so that 30 seconds later the big reveal is now a tepid event that you caught onto 28 seconds ago , 29 if somehow your brain hadn't turned off before that and taken the extra second to wake up."
8572,"It's a great time at the movies. The special effects are very well done, and the monsters look real. But that's what makes Goosebumps so appealing. It's somewhat understandable since they're more reliable when it comes to making a profit, as seen by the success that Pixar and Dreamworks have had. Jack Black is quite enjoyable, seems to having the most fun has Stine, at times he is a little over the top, but in a good way."
8573,"Watch till the end, nice twists. But even if you are able to see everything happening, each event IS unpredictable. Ealy's smug facial expressions, likable smile, and sexy charisma make him almost irresistibly attractive from the first frame he's in, and even when he shows his despicable ways, he is still a fascinating character. A very solid supporting cast back up the excellent performances of the three main characters, and all three are also pretty easy on the eye. He says and does everything perfect, but when she sees his dark side things change."
8574,"The eerie atmosphere together with the unpredictably quick turnarounds makes the feature quite effective. The cast is aces and the three real supporting players (Fox, Russell, Jenkins) all get their time to shine without anything being forced. The gory violence is shocking to watch, even just hearing the graphic noises is enough. Written and directed by S. Craig Zahler, the movie has a smart and tight screenplay. The dialogues r good, the character development is brilliant n the acting is top notch."
8575,"P. J. Hogan is one of the best screenwriters. After' Proof' was a major critical success in 1991, American features followed, but this is the first for Ms Moorhouse in nearly 2 decades. Dig a little deeper and you will be rewarded with some brilliant performances. The film is set in the 1950s and is both serious and funny. She is everything the town isn't - sophisticated, stylish, experienced and worldly and she has come back for one reason."
8577,"Will Smith delivers his best performance to date, which he is already being acknowledged for a golden globes (as he should be). Likewise, Dr. Joseph Maroon (Arliss Howard )'s portrayal in the movie is also highly sensationalized. As for the other performances, they were top notch as well. The film "" Concussion "" deals with that on going drama just fine as it follows the research and work of one real life pathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu (played in a tough strong performance manner from Will Smith). Instead of focusing on compelling athletes competing in a physical game."
8578,"The Little Red - Haired Girl explains she admires his selflessness and praises him as an honest, caring, and compassionate person. Thankfully, it appears that the people behind "" The Peanuts Movie "" take the legacy of these characters very seriously, and the result is a gentle, charming movie that seems far less frantic than much of what is created for young audiences these days. It has captured the magic of Peanuts. Created by Charles M. Shulz in the 1950s about a bald headed kid doing his best to get by in life like any other average Joe, seemed to stick with its audience. The cast of young voice actors all seem appropriately chosen, and it's interesting to hear how they've gone out of their way to find kids who naturally sound like the voices that have been connected to the characters for over 40 years now."
8579,"The music is amazing, everything is spot on. The backgrounds are richly detailed and the characters move naturally as well as fluidly. The backgrounds are beautiful as well. It's a good anime movie, but not superb. Solid movie, if your looking for a good anime movie that your going to enjoy check it out."
8581,"Victoria Justice and Pierson Fode definitely bring out the best in their diverse characters. Definitely worth checking out if your into movies like this. Overall, No Kiss List is entertaining, funny, heart - warming and also a little dramatic at times. All in all this is a really good coming of age story and LGBT movie. Naomi played by the talented Victoria Justices and Ely played by Pierson Fode are the perfect best friends."
8582,"Coogler captured the look of Philadelphia extremely well. Michael B. Jordan is fantastic as Creed. Both equally emotive and with comic interruptions, Jordan and Stallone deliver impressive performances. From start to finish, this film exhilarates and crackles with brilliant on screen performances and masterfully directed fight sequences. Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone deliver, and Creed ends up being exactly what fans hoped it would be."
8583,"But since this is real life with Sam having had the vision to just record everything, what happened is what often happens in real life, which was that nothing bad happened. This got into motion messages, friend requests, online chats, Skype visits, and finally a remarkable face - to - face visit in London. Some of the scenes are composed entirely of Sam and Anais just laughing. As the protagonist becomes immersed in the totally surreal experience of discovering and meeting her doppelgÃ¤nger on another continent, the viewer can completely empathize with every twinge of emotion, euphoria, stupefaction, and deep, deep feeling. By turns hilarious and heartrending, it really gives you the whole roller - coaster experience."
8584,"Good pace and nicely done action sequences, can't see a thing wrong with it. It is a subtle, understated performance, perhaps his best since the Silence Of The Lambs. Colin Farrell does a good job, the other characters are OK but not outstanding. The film provides plenty of depth to the characters, and immediately put the audience on their side. Both of them are as convincing as FBI agents as a squirrel."
8585,"The change of people, cities, and life itself is portrayed in a both sentimental and amusing way. The actors credit include both young and talented actors beside very experienced and master actors in Turkish Cinema. Writer & director Burak Aksak put an extraordinary performance, similar to his previous works like Leyla ile Mecnun and Ben de Ã–zledim. Pretty successful but the film has lots of mistakes in it. Finally, If you want to laugh and miss Leyla and Mecnun go to the cinema and watch "" Bana Masal Anlatma ""."
8587,"What starts out as a tour of the murder sites becomes a much deeper story of identity and belonging, surprisingly a good watch. Duplas and Phillips both give good performances, and they're both able to really flesh out their characters. It's funny, in places, but it's also a great character study. It's a drama with some funny moments. Life is good for Nick, until his wild brother Conrad comes for an L. A. visit."
8589,"It's dark and bright in the best of ways. So this has the same star and it was co-written by one of the writers of Scrooged. But it grows on you with memories of Christmas's past. This special starts out bad, possibly purposely so, with Amy Poehler hamming it up something awful. Bill Murray has such avid fans that he could have made this memorable and it's just very rushed."
8590,"There are rare exceptions to the rule and this is one of them. Alex Van Warmerdam is a director with a very distinguishable cinematographic style. He has this very special way of filming in a hyper - realistic fimstyle, with an ironic sense of humor. The unique Van Warmerdam chemistry of some of his other films didn't work as well in this one. After' Abel' ,' de Noordelingen' ,' kleine Teun' ,' de jurk' and many others, this is another example of Alex' special, wonderful qay of storytelling."
8591,"Kate Blanchett is really good and totally believable as are the other characters. Blanchett is one of the best actors working now. The films chief assets are a smart, snappy screenplay and an another astoundingly nuanced performance by Cate Blanchett. As cautionary players on the big media stage, they are the finest examples of flawed human beings. , as the real issues, arguments and truths get lost in superficialities that better lend themselves to headlines and 30 - second grabs, and how the news agenda is buffeted by politics, corporate demands and entertainment values."
8592,"Nice to see Marisa Tomei, Hamish Linklater, John Magaro, Rafe Spall, Finn Wittrock, Max Greenfield and talented others working at a solid level. The acting is stellar from the stars to the bit players. With a mammoth cast, McKay draws on a plethora of talent in the likes of Hollywood A-listers including Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, Selena Gomez, Christian Bale, Karen Gillan Steve Carell, Marisa Tomei, Melissa Leo and Finn Wittrock. Steve Carell dug deep and came up with a real mensch. And like the Bourbons, t The cast is stellar--especially Christian Bale and Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling as well as the minor players."
8593,"There are plenty of Happy Madison films out there, going back as early as the 90's! It was certainly more entertaining than 90% of the crap you troglodytes lap up at the box office. Basically put, if you like Adam Sandler at all here and there, give this movie a go. Two, Sandler played the central character absolutely straight. A ton of laughs and a good time, with a tiny bit of poking fun at the "" Western Films "" genre."
8594,"It's amazing how many of Hertzfeldt's films have various levels on which you can enjoy them. But it's again oddly appropriate; Hertzfeldt manages to elicit the deepest emotions from these simplistic representations of humans. There's that stunning shot of a red mountain range hugging the sheer ocean - or it could well be clouds drifting ethereally above a streaked orange sunset. This Emily takes her younger self on a journey through her life, which has seen her fall in love with rocks, robots, and eventually a fellow clone, who, because of his finances, had to settle for a less safe process. This is a startlingly provocative seventeen minutes and should not be missed."
8597,"If you're just looking to get your annual fix of a bit of Ferrell hilarity then you won't be disappointed. Wahlberg seems happy to let Ferrell take the reins and is comfortable just doing what he does best, with his laid back, dry sense of humour accompanying Ferrell perfectly. What there is doubt about is how to perfectly utilise each of the two as characters. The mix of polar opposites Will Ferrell and Mark Walhberg was almost perfect. ' Daddy's Home' is the second collaboration between Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, the first being 2010's' The Other Guys'."
8598,"Really, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, and this is as good as they can do, this movie is for teenage boys, young pubescent kids. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are two of the funniest comedians working right now. The chemistry between the two of them is electric, and there are a handful of good laughs scattered amidst the almost two - hour runtime. Just like comedy skits from these types of TV shows, some of the jokes succeed resulting in uproarious laughter while others produce a mere snigger or nothing at all. Maya Rudolph is one of the actresses who fits in this category of overacting at times but when she pulls it off, she is absolutely hilarious."
8602,"Performance wise, it is Deepika Padukone all the way. And the dialogues are a marvel. In the end everything in the movie was fantastic. The sets and art direction are so well crafted, huge and super grand. The music, costumes, scenery, sets and decor are exquisite!"
8605,"Potentially the best DTV action title of the year. To be just, the fighting scenes where incredibly well executed and performed. Fantastic fight scenes, creative shoot outs. But the stunt scenes are really well thought of, as are the camera angles and moves. These scenes are an even balance of fights and shootouts, and both are exhilarating."
8611,"especially those featuring Frances Taylor (Emayatzy Corinealdi) as Miles' beautiful, talented and supportive wife. At the end, a stunning scene brings it all together and emphasizes the phenomenal impact of the Miles music through today, for all time, and across many genres. Attended the world premiere at the NewYork film festival this past weekend. Which Rolling Stone magazine voted it as one of the best albums of all time, regardless of genre of music. Couple of comments: first and foremost, this movie is a labor of love AND a tour - de-force by Don Cheadle, who stars in the title role and directs, and he also co-wrote the script and co-produced."
8648,"This film is darn near perfect. He was charming to those soft ears. A few years later in the 1990's, a young man name of Clark Rockefeller infiltrated the upper - crust of New York, claiming he was a member of the Rockefeller family, one of the most elite and prestigious of American clans. Certainly, the best known is Clark Rockeller, but he also want by Christopher Chichester, Chip Smith, and Chris C. Crowe among others. After convincing some American's to "" sponsor "" him, he moved to San Marcos, CA, a quasi-Beverly Hills located in the northeastern part of the Los Angeles area."
8620,"This little sentimental but funny and ultimately emotionally satisfying film is the work of Laura Terruso (form her previous short film' Doris & The Intern') and Michael Showalter who also directs. Norma Rae, Edna Spalding, Mrs. Gump, Mary Todd Lincoln, and Doris Miller. In this latest film, writer / director Michael Showalter (The Baxter) and co-writer Laura Terruso strive to balance heartfelt emotions with situational laughs. Generally, May - December romances involve older men with younger women, and Field herself starred in one such film, "" Murphy's Romance "" with James Garner, although the age difference in that film disappeared through the stars' chemistry. Sally Field's most recent role, Doris Miller, is a worthy addition to her amazing gallery of film performances, given since she emerged as Gidget a half century ago."
8193,"There's much to say about how inconsistent and illogical some of the narrative choices that the screenwritersn took are, but they get overshadowed by the more relevant, and on this case, more effectively utilized, high - tension action extravaganza. This fifth installment in the franchise surges with death - defying action proceedings, riveting and pulsing with the relentlessness and explosiveness of its spiking adrenaline, to deliver the franchise's most thrilling outing, yet. At such moments, cinematography is top notch, and the breathtaking panorama becomes an exquisite backdrop for the ever - imminent rumbles. One of the few movies where the ending just pleases you so much. The action scenes in this film are also some of the best in this franchise."
8595,"That's it for positives, though. That's not to say that it didn't have it's problems, but it excelled in what mattered most: It was an excellent representation of what made the original so great. Every scene is fantastically put together, the action sequences are brilliantly choreographed, and it is generally a very nice film to look at. It is a well crafted over the top comedy with some clever and satirical gags. The plot had direction, it had more energy and Will Ferrell had a couple of funny moments."
8596,"Its her funniest, saddest, and truest performance to date. But like your uncle who tries to stay hip and relevant by using Facebook, the results are cringeworthy and frankly, a little bit creepy. At this time of year, cinemas are chock - full of Oscar nominated films that work hard to deliver you quality entertainment. The dialogue in many of the scenes is quite literally on that same level of obscurity. Furthermore, multiple laugh out loud - moments."
8624,"The scenes in the North are mostly effective and judiciously used; the muted colour palette here isn't allowed to become boring, and this mini saga is undoubtedly uplifted by Blunt's delicate performance. Only Charlize Theron brilliance manages to make her somewhat relatable. Throw in Emily Blunt and Jessica Chastain and you're confronted with a pretty enviable - if surprising - cast for a film of this level. The cast is nice, Chris Hemsworth, Charlize Theron, Jessica Chastain and Emily Blunt are all accomplished actors and they did their roles well. Contractual obligations aside, Hemsworth and Theron resume their roles with great gusto, with Hemsworth arguably vastly improving on his performance in the first film."
8630,"You will probably recognize a lot of the situations as the movie is very much in touch with today's social reality and how people cope with it. The sound track is fun, the pratfalls are OK, but the stories are real. But if you like a good clean movie that isn't filled with naked sex starved scenes you will enjoy it. This movie is very funny and has lots of funny tag lines to laugh about later. They rip movies apart so much it's hard to please them."
8599,"The 3rd part is as hilarious and awesome as the first two movies. Just like the first and the second film, KUNG FU PANDA 3's animation is sharp and beautiful. Kung Fu Panda 3 is a true treat on many levels and great for any family, date or lover of animation. The standout for the limited screen time he has is Seth Rogen's Mantis. This is another great animated film for the entire family, that will surely delight people of all ages."
8504,"But this is perfected symbolism and one of the places where editing shines. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. "" Why does Luthor introduce Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent to each other? "" 3 / 4th of this movie is dedicated to this. People's pasts often dictate how they move forward, and the things he had experienced differed greatly from the other characters."
8601,"Good performances and directing and you have what it takes. The actors did a great job, honestly. All the actors are at least credible and the camera work and lighting are exceptionally good for this kind of film. and this is proof that when you have good actors and a good producer. Just beyond the opening scenes, Standoff quickly rises above its cheapness as an enjoyable and gripping suspense thriller."
8644,"The Purge: Election Year builds on the groundwork of the first 2 movies well even though it has some setbacks. It's cool that James DeMonaco and his team aren't just content to coast on what they've built and try something different each time. One great thing about ANARCHY was that the story revolved around the mystery and the enigma of the mysterious violent anti-hero who had his own motives for trawling the streets during purge night. With Roan just 1 point behind in the polls, the NFFA decides that Roan must be' taken care of' in the upcoming Purge. Seemed like the audience was enjoying the movie, hollering and hooting at all the bright moments."
8487,"Directed by Justin Lin, "" Star Trek: Beyond "" opens with one of its better scenes. Some of the scenes were of course visually impressive though sometimes things would fly around too much and contaminate the image. One - dimensional characters, a whirlwind of imagery, a meager story and over the top villains and hero's. Scotty transports Spock and McCoy into one of Krall's drone ships where they eject the crew. The older films and TV Shows next to spectacle always offered good drama and thought provoking concepts about many essential things that matter in life."
8604,"The costumes and scenery are top notch and very believable of the period. The acting was excellent - Matt Smith, as others have said is wonderful - and the production superb. Even the color tones are just perfect through out the movie. They are the film's best fighters Lena Headey ("" Game of Thrones "") makes an impression in her limited screen time as an eye - patched Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and Jack Huston ("" Boardwalk Empire "") is well cast as Wickham."
8635,"This time round, the film spends a lot of time introducing the new characters and to set the picture. To try and spice it up they tried the twist with Morgan Freeman's character, but nobody believed it, not even Mr. Freeman. Who cares, a magician never reveals his tricks (hint: CGI)."
8606,"The playing by Cumberbatch, Freeman and Andrew Scott as the three main protagonists was never better. The references to the main series are also enjoyable. The writing really was terrific with a plot that had more ups and downs than a mountain range, more ins and outs than Hampton Court Maze and more twists and turns than a dozen corkscrews, in short it was a triumph."
8608,"Together with some conversations from Kim himself, which was recorded by Choi and Shin secretly, audience gets an deeper insight on the man who was seen as a tyrant of the world. The documentary also covers the incident from the different perspective: the traumas faced by Choi and Shin's family member, especially their two adopted children; British police officers conducting the investigation on the disappearance of Choi and Shin in Hong Kong, where both were kidnapped in different locations; the South Korean CIA agent investigating the kidnap, which links to the study of North Korea movie industry and Kim's passion towards movies; Japanese film critic who assisted Shin to passed the message to their family back in South Korea; an former North Korea adviser who works for Kim and shares the unknown side of the late North Korea dictator. It was a time when Kim Jong - un's father, Kim Jong - il, had absolute power over North Koreans and, among other things, used cinema to spread the idea North Korea should be an example of success and democracy. The Lovers and the Despot is one of the most important documentaries that document the evolution of North and South Korea film industry. Rather than having the usual conversations filled up the documentary, The Lovers and the Despot provides the audience with tonnes of rare footage, ranging from video clips from the movies made by Choi, Shin and Kim to photos and archival records."
8609,"Unlike most horror movies And above all, A story with actually a hint of Originality in it. A good test if it will work on you is to grab a toy doll and stare into its eyes; if your mind can fantasise it staring back at you with malicious intent, you pass and should see The Boy. Lauren Cohan is well cast as Greta and the story moves along at a lively pace. Until then, the film maintains a menacing Gothic atmosphere and enough surprises to keep you guessing what will happen next. Many scenes are with her and the doll alone."
8610,"There are a lot of light moments, actually the whole movie has a very light tone to it She has the combination of charisma, physical beauty, character - acting chops, and inner luminosity to pull a fairly nice , 7 - of - 10 heartwarmer up to a 9 - of - 10 charmer. Instead it focuses on the good times and precious moments he spends will Lou. The house Claflin's character lives in looks very nice. The high point of the film is the performance by Emelia Clarke."
8632,"There was some great cinematography and shots of the area. On a positive note the cinematography was good as were 6 mins of the film. There are some far - fetched scenes, sure, but Jaws had them as well and it's hailed as a classic. There's a quiet fierceness and admirability to her character that makes it easy to root for her survival. In fact, after two nights, in this emergency state, she still has the strength and stamina of an Olympic athlete."
8612,"Great job uncle J. J., you did it again. This is a spectacle of tension and suspense of epic proportions. The performances are great, looking up to a surprising Winstead and a unrestrained unforgettable turn by Goodman. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is also very likable as the resourceful protagonist. Clever marketing, brilliant story, very good direction, great performance by the cast, it's hard to complain about this film!"
8613,"In a nutshell: Supposed best of the' land of free' (the sunny place where everyone is happy and waves their spangley flag) come over to the London (where is constantly rains and everyone is incompetent and rather sad). At 1 hour 40 - in an age of bloated, long movies that think they're more intelligent than they are - this is frankly a breath of fresh air. This isn't going to get any Oscars, but it's a brilliantly retro action movie that takes itself far less seriously than throw - back action films like Taken, which is no less crazy in the plot department. This film, despite its good lead cast appears to have left the brains of plot and due process behind as it made the leap across the pond. Bombs can be placed in every famous building without anyone noticing."
8486,"Characters explain to the audience the basic plot five minutes after exposition time. Small objects that are hidden can be monitored in detail by the good guys, while objects the size of a continent are completely undetectable. There was soul to that movie, even though it was an ensemble cast, characters were developed, the story progressed and there were heroes you cheered for and aliens you despised. It is true that when you are young, you see movies like the original "" ID4 "" from a different perspective, most often you judge them better than what they really are, and this undeniably is a fact of life. It has two good CGI scenes, which you can watch at home some months from now."
8614,"Everything about this movie is just awesome! How can someone not like this masterpiece! Zootopia is one of Disney's best! However, where the two leave a lasting impression is in finding that perfect balance between its consistently gripping storyline & moments of pure hilarity. These are a great example of characters in animated movies!"
8631,"The two leads are ace, both giving near - career best performances. The basics of this scene are given a fresh and wonderfully gory rework that is truly memorable. A comedy with brains, Black's latest benefits from a superb script and great performances from Crowe, Gosling, and it's secondary cast members. It's a nice breath of fresh air with some clever dialogue, noir elements, good action and two perfect stars in the main roles. Thankfully, the scene in question brings viewers up to speed before the thrilling, and often explosive, finale at the Los Angles Auto Show which provides a satisfying conclusion to the events that preceded it."
8615,"The funniest movie for at least a year! This is one of the best gutter humour movies ever released and definitely worthy of repeat viewings if you're a fan of this type of comedy, and especially if you appreciate Sacha Baron Cohen's brand of humour. Rude, crude, filthy, but absolutely hilarious with numerous laugh - out - loud moments. Strong is more of the straight man to Baron Cohen's bumbling fool but it's the situations they find themselves in that promote the laugh factor. The "" plot "" cracks along and the jokes are pretty much continuous, and filthy."
8485,"The movie has cool set pieces, action scenes and fantastic costumes. sure it would take years to build up a universe like that, but come on, that's what Marvel did and their movies are amazing! Still Fun to Watch: The movie with all its faults is nonetheless fun to watch at times and the performances aren't bad. The preciousness Hollywood has for its ongoing world building of interconnected comic book films creates such tight restrictions on storytelling that anything that might upset that world has no room to prosper. He should have full gotten his own movie or only been in certain scenes."
8481,"As a whole, this a cute, but flawed film. It's colorful, it's fun at times, provides a positive message about acceptance and provides a clever enough high concept to keep the kids on their keesters for 80 minutes. Lots of laughs and clever humour. This film, although not side splittingly funny was very amusing and the film makers are so very clever in creating a personality for each and every one of the animals in this film. The one that would have the best animation, story, characters, emotions, etc. ."
8641,"So that should set your expectations. Sure, there are a few awkward moments, yet they make the best out of it to present a light humorous spectacle, a better buddy cop gimmick than expected. Kevin Hart is excellent in creating reactions and gestures. Many of the good moments come from his outbursts and babbling. The Ride Along movies and Get Hard were shredded by critics."
8658,"Don't go expecting an epiphany or any gritty revelations, this is a story retold with love and one suspects, awe. One of the people who Ron Howard interviews in the movie is Whoopi Goldberg. A movie that brings a freshness to old material with new interviews, unseen footage and enhanced sound and images. The film is also nicely interlaced with celebrity cameos recalling their linkage to the Fab Four's performances (often moving, like Whoopi Goldberg's) and the group's "" legacy "" effect on modern - day art (in Richard Curtis's case rather less convincing). they had their doubts, and John would go through a motivational chant to lift their spirits."
8423,"Kirsten Dunst and Adam Driver offer good support and Jaeden Lieberher is rather good as Alton. Then the ending solves beautifully these tensions, it is quite an inspiring and even almost poetic finale, with very sleek shots of the extra world. Well written, excellent acting performances all round. Jaeden Lieberher is going to be a star, judging by his excellent performance as Alton. religious extremists who don't understand the profound nature of the supernatural skill, check!"
8645,"Simple fun to be enjoyed by anyone who can see past some of the stupid lines, nonsensical plot themes and obvious set ups. Mike and Dave and played by Adam Devine and Zac Efron respectively. Based on the outtakes over the end credits the cast was having more laughs then the audience. You know the premise from the trailers but where are the laughs, few and far between. ' Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates' had some promise when the trailers first came out."
8625,"In fact, the funniest moments are the unrelated, extraneous conversations that fill up space between physical actions. The actors did their part and there were maybe 3 or 4 amusing scenes. Seth Rogen is the hardest to watch. The first Neighbors movie was funny, not the funniest movie made or anything like that but pretty funny. The acting was fine, there was just a lack of anything resembling a story - line to breathe life into."
8640,"Acting is spot on (bravo Mark Strong), and the reactions never feel alien or unrealistic. A good story isn't about a lot of action, a lot of events, it lies in the subtleties and how they come together. He also has to cope with the burden of the entire humanity back on Earth cheering for him and placing the highest expectations on his shoulders. He knows what is on Earth, and wants one moment of pure wonder as he ventures into space and eventually Mars. For those who claim that the movie is scientifically inaccurate: The Martian had SOUND AND EXPLOSIONS in space (good job, really good job Ridley Scott nice way of making some blockbuster money)."
8652,"The over-the-top factors (of which there were hundreds, of course) weren't thrown together haphazardly - they were all woven together in a strangely well executed tapestry of utter ridiculousness. The previous movies had fun moments, especially because they were so over the top and so amazingly fake. Reynolds is good, but the "" Sharknado "" series is getting long in the tooth. Other beautiful young women include Claudia Shepard and Masiela Lusha. You also get the handsome, legendary and talented "" Hoff "" (as Colonel David Hasselhoff)."
8629,"IAW is not terribly original; however, it is competently executed. There are a few neat twists in this but for the most part you can predict everything that is going to happen pretty easy. Speaking of tough guys, Christopher Meloni turned in an affable performance providing support and a touch of one - liner comedy. His actual BMI, his talent and of course the simpleness of this movie brings the spectator a trip back where movies were about their genre, in this case an action movie. In terms of the little B action movies that have been coming out this is definitely one of the best ones, but again this movie has been done over and over and is just not all that exciting."
8651,"It's ingenious, tense and full of occurrences. The characters are rich as always. Every characters are so impressive and feel be detailed. Kingsglaive is much more colorful and there is much more going on at the same time. Characters are relatively well done, especially the ones with famous names."
8626,"It sounds like a clichÃ© with a twist, and it is, but it's a really good clichÃ© with a twist. Some are great (You're Next), some are tolerable (The Strangers) and some are downright terrible (When A Stranger Calls , 2006). Equally inventive and enthralling are those scenes where Maddie's imaginative capability is put to test. It's very tense and cleverly written bar a few clichÃ© tropes that come with this kind of movie. It's constantly engaging, and that has a lot to do with the terrific performances of both the man and Maggie, and there are a few scenes that are genuinely depraved and chilling."
8362,"Singer's previous movie, DotFP, was outstanding. Some scenes worked well and others didn't. The recent Deadpool, who ostensibly shares the universe with the X-men, was awesome. It's also funny that her powers is to not be JLaw. While it was fun to watch, it didn't do much of anything for the story in the long run."
8619,"A cool thing about movies like this, is the re-watch-ability of them. It seems that, after the massive success of Drive, Refn is being given the opportunity to make the films he wants to make and take a lot of creative license. Aside from a memorable strobe - light inspired scene of a performance at a model - populated L. A. party, Refn adds nothing new to his aesthetic arsenal that he has not already splashed on the screen with his previous four films. Watch Un Chien Andalou and then got to Burning Man festival and you'll have all the inspiration you will need for a sequel. Most movies are best the first time you see them, and don't offer much for a repeated viewing."
8656,"Performances: Hrithik Roshan is back with a bang and has delivered a stellar performance in Mohenjo Daro. It looks at Hercules and now he wants to go to the Holy fable land of Mohen - Jo - Daro. Romance with Pooja Hegde shine beautifully. Mohenjo Daro is a must watch for its breathtaking stunts, awesome visuals, melodious music, and power - packed performance of Hrithik Roshan! There's no doubt that Pooja Hegde is here to stay in Bollywood and Mohenjo Daro will be an epitome of her success."
8650,"Performance-Wise :' Hell or High Water' is filled with superior performances. In closing, this film has amazing writing, cinematography, acting, pacing, everything. The setting of the movie really sets it above others in the genre. Pine, always reliable as a A-lister, takes his craft to a whole new level. The main characters, Chris Pine and Ben Foster turn in great performances."
8649,"Director is BAFTA nominee Oscar Sharp. Some reviews have described it as "" hilarious and intense "", which gives you an indication of the average level of intelligence out there. In short it is the delivery of the film, not the origins of it, that makes it work. The dialogue is scintillating and brought to life by a stellar cast mixing established stars with some new faces. The actors are good and elevate the material, including Emmy nominee Thomas Middleditch from Silicon Valley who apparently found the project interesting enough to star in this little movie."
8634,"It keeps things believable and consistent. The sound effects and the music are top notch. It is still very watchable when acting, camera work, and special effects are good. the line was not random and the actors were good. The special effects are top notch, the acting is good, the story is engaging, the pace is keeping you on your tows."
8571,"This is one of the best ensemble performances in recent memory. The scene between Alden Ehrenreich and Ralph Finnes is a gem. The production values, the sets, the props, the overall look, and dialog are just about as close to perfect as human beings can get. Each has its style, director, crew, and most importantly its stars. Alden Ehrenreich is a breath of fresh air with vintage breezes that are exciting, compelling and totally disarming."
8361,"the stakes are so incredibly high. Everything was so well put and the story and plot worked very smoothly. The fight scenes were very well done and well choreographed. Anthony Mackie has a lot of good screen time, specially in the action moments. It was a carefully orchestrated scene that showed these films are for young cinema - goers."
8633,"It is visually exquisite, Costumes, production design, cinematography, music, all combine to create a lush vision of Japan - occupied Korea in the 1930s. Set in the 1930s Japanese occupied Korea, it's a story of a young female pickpocket (Kim Tae - ri) who becomes a handmaiden to a beautiful Japanese heiress (Min - hee Kim). The second part shows the abusive relationship of Uncle Kouzuki and Hideko since her childhood. "" Ah - ga - ssi "", a. k. a. "" The Handmaiden "", is a classy South Korean erotic thriller divided in three parts and directed by Chan - wook Park. What is immediately apparent from the start of the film is how well Park Chan - wook's aesthetic fits into the time period."
8642,"The original trilogy still stands out as one of the most intelligent post-Cold War spy action thrillers and it mostly succeeded in being the last word in the genre. Then again, she is a newbie with a whole string of good movies ahead of her, career-wise, whereas the actors in this film seemed more interested in taking the money. Tommy Lee Jones delivers possibly the most superficial performance of his excellent career and the money he was offered cannot begin to make up for the indignity of the closeups. In the end, a dish of leftovers will still serve its purpose, especially when you are famished. What's more is that Matt Damon, Alicia Vikander and Tommy Lee Jones all put in very strong performances to add a degree of gravitas to what is in truth a very clichÃ©d and repetitive story, which was good to see."
8647,"Conclusion Nerve has good performances from its two leads and a unique visual style, and it certainly has its fair share of entertainment. It also acts as a vehicle for up and coming talents such as Emma Roberts and Dave Franco, who both give good performances. Emma Roberts and Dave Franco both give solid performances in this film, and they each work well off of each other. The film is delivered with style and verve as well, with innovative graphics (a great title and end title design) and an' augmented reality' overlay of the action showing Players and Watchers across the city. In real time, Watchers set Players with challenges they have to complete for ever - escalating financial rewards"
8360,"They are incredibly similar in their style of fight scenes. "" Deadpool "" is a very fun movie. In the end, it is essential to say that Ryan Reynolds is absolutely great as Wade Wilson / Deadpool. Deadpool is a unique film, and a huge gamble. Flashbacks and fast - forwards can be annoying as hell, but when done right, they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting."
8643,"And the CGI wizardry is seamless, photo - realistic, and effective on all levels. They are huge, aggressive monsters with razor sharp teeth. He had been able to even defeat the great apes. After a great opening scene, there is the filmic equivalent of "" dead air "" for about 35 minutes and when the script does finally get in gear it stumbles and falls, subject to a wildly disjointed narrative and equally bizarre editing. Yates is the first to do it; his Legend of Tarzan stands head and shoulders above the Tarzan movies that came before it â€“ and regardless of how it fares in the crowded summer theatrical marketplace, it is assured of a place in cinema history as the Tarzan movie that captured the heart and spirit of Burroughs' creation."
8646,"The story is gripping, the characters interesting with authentic intensity. The entire cast is quite strong, with Page, Janney, and Blanchard giving some really powerful work here. It has brilliantly portrayed and written flawed characters. Page and Janney are both excellent in the leads, especially Page, and the characters are both extremely flawed but likable. Allison Janney is really good as the grandmother, Margo."
8654,"The setting and style of everything in the locations where also great to see and felt real and interesting. Bringing out the perfect blend of 1980s nostalgia. Production values are also quite good with some beautiful cinematography, editing, lighting and sound. Everything about it is great, the actors, the writing, the fact that it takes place in the FREAKING 80s (YES! ) However, the star of the show here is definitely Eleven (played by Millie Bobby Brown) who plays the ET type of role in show."
8356,"So Everything about this movie felt right. Paula Patton did a fantastic job with Garona. Travis Fimmel as Anduin Lothar was a good choice. Dunca Jones working alongside with Blizzard was a genius move and it shows throughout the movie. Well the CGI is breathtaking easily equal or better to AVatar and Dawn of the Apes, equally to JUngle book (what a great movie! )"
8088,"in the late 90's because it was a great coming of age tale. The usefulness of a car ride as a sort of journey device is marginalized by the redundant and boring settings. There are some good live performance in it (from the likes of Dwarfs and Screeching Weasel), and the soundtrack is pretty cool though! a lot of your old favorites are back and there all plenty of call backs to the original to give you a nice laugh and let you feel that nostalgia. Although Merendino made it clear Stevos (Lillard) and Mike (Segel) would not return, many fans still held onto hope that maybe they would at least make a brief cameo."
8355,"Yes - the cinematic technique is of course better than in the predecessors, especially in the galley scenes, and it is visually stunning. It is still unsurpassed among the great epic blockbusters and truly moving - whether you believe in Jesus or not. In a lot of scenes characters pull of certain moves that they would not have been able to if they did not have control over the power of editing. As is increasingly common in modern blockbusters there's also a heavy use of CGI â€“ which in and of itself isn't necessarily a bad thing â€“ except here it is woefully underdone and sticks out like a sore thumb, especially in the numerous wide shots attempting to establish scale and grandeur. The best way to describe it is "" Hercules meets Robin Hood "" and had it been a TV show, lots would have been forgiven because most TV shows seldom has the budget or the actors to do make historical drama's stand out."
8622,""" Ice Age: The Great Egg - Scapade "" is a 25 - minute animated short film from this year and the title already gives it away. When she recommends him to her neighbors â€“ a condor mom (Wendy Williams), Cholly Bear (Gabriel Iglesias) and Gladys Glypto (Lili Estefan) â€“ business booms at his new egg - sitting service. Scrat's latest mishap with his acorn is worth a chuckle too. Surprisingly, using a pirate treasure map story to explain the origins of the Easter egg hunt works out well. In Ice Age: The Great Egg - Scapade harried prehistoric bird mom Ethel (Taraji P. Henson, EMPIRE) entrusts her precious, soon - to - hatch egg to Sid (John Leguizamo)."
8627,"The direction is assured, acting is superb and production values are excellent. What may of seemed a good idea to someone, shows how even a group of people so experienced and more than qualified took the money and went on holiday, not for a rest, as they all did that, very well already. Even though the film deals with a serious subject, an eye opener leading one to wonder about the real money monsters out there, it remains an excellent thriller with top class actors. Producer - actor George Clooney is known for his anti-establishment movies, and ones such as "" Ides of March "" are excellent. Recommendation: Even though Money Monster is your typical hostage thriller with a predictable ending, the great acting and surprising twists keep you guessing and at the edge of your seat."
8655,"Performance wise Akshay Kumar is very good. His Parsi accent, way of walking and expressions are fantastic. Rustom, inspired by the Nanavati case, is entertaining to say the least. Well done Akshay, with Special 26, Holiday, Baby and now Rustom, you have really come well out of the Khiladi mould. Arjan Bajwa, Esha Gupta, Illean D'Cruz, Parmeet Sethi are all fairly decent as well, though, could have been utilized better."
8623,"40 - something audiences will definitely get another level of enjoyment out of all the allusions to great 80s bands. This is a film that works on so many levels. Its an amazing movie for all ages. The Music is amazing even the original songs are fantastic. The excitement Brendan and Conor feel in watching Duran Duran's Rio music video is infectious, and the original songs by the band are easily the best thing about Sing Street."
8508,"Second, good characters with relevant appearances. Everything is excellent about this movie. The computer generated imagery is brilliant all throughout, definitely some of the best ever and the 3D is just mind blowing. Disney Picture is the best company in making top and number 1 family movies. A high point of the movie was when Mogli helped the elephant baby from the pit."
8657,"The scenes with the humans are also shot in a very dynamic and fast paced way. CGIs are really great in this movie, not like ones you saw in previous movies. PROS: The acting was great as a whole, comprising of much seriousness and focus, typical of the exigency of a nation - wide disaster, in the top politicians of the diet. The action scenes are entertaining enough and there's plenty of destruction featured with some surprising moments here and there. All in all, it was a great Japanese film that comes out only once in few years."
8639,"Few jump scares, very well situated, some of them very unpredictable. Her presence was so strong, and powerful that she managed to pull the viewer through all kind of emotions. There were many rising suspense scenes and you have no idea what will happen. The thing about The Conjuring series is that it screams classic right at the first few scenes and just works its way up from there. The film doesn't give anything new at the horror movie genre, but its set pieces are often impressive, even if sometimes rely a bit on jump scares."
8621,"There are plenty of laugh out loud moments, but the plot of Keanu falls back into clichÃ©d territory far too often. With that said, when the laughs hit, they hit hard. It, like many other parts of this movie, seemed to be thrown in just to get a laugh. Get some friends and go have some good laughs. And Keanu replacing what would be a person in distress makes for a hilarious spoof on traditional damsel - in - distress type tropes."
8628,"Yes, it has some very minor charming parts. The characters and their traits are strong and there are a lot of side jokes built in to this too. Witty and fast - paced, with a good mix of gags for the adults and their kids, plus a potent dose of the studio's famed poignancy. No shortage of colorful new characters there, literally and figuratively, not the least of which is Ed O'Neill's escape artist "" septipus "" (having lost a tentacle in the touch tank), who treads dangerously close to becoming a deus ex machina with his versatility. It seems that Pixar thrives on adding emotional scenes to their films that pull at their audience's heartstrings."
8638,"Andy Samberg shines in the main role. Still, it's vastly entertaining and the performances are aces. Verdict: An absolute blast, with a frenetic strike - rate and songs that will worm their way into your ears for days. This is certainly a Lonely Island movie and probably one of the best of their movies it's completely relentless even the greatest comedy kings and queens will love it. Andy Samberg excels at the comedy but also on making the lead a very likable protagonist, no mater his flaws."
8637,"Looks like the portal must be a cast member from these type of movies. The obvious answer is yes, of course it's dumb, it's more superhero schlock: kiddie - fare enjoyed by 30 - somethings. Along for the ride are Bebop and Rocksteady, two dimwitted henchmen who provide plenty of muscle. If all you are looking for is cheap thrills and cool CGI action scenes, then you may enjoy this. With the acceptance and blessing of the police, the Turtles go into action, confronting Krang aboard the still - assembling Technodrome."
3398,"Interviews and amazing archive coverage makes this an entertaining and vastly interesting viewing experience. Laurence Fishburne narrates this must for all fans of the international sports icon. The IMAX screen works wonderfully with expansive sites as was the case with Everest. The best thing about this film is that it was done in IMAX form which really details everything so clearly and incredibly. Come on now, using clips of three of Michael's TV ads to show what a great personality he has?"
2145,"The Yards stands on its own, and even though it is no masterpiece it is a very interesting and tense drama with a great cast. This movie had some nice moments, and great acting, but it can't rise above a script that tries to pack too much plot into too little time. The excellent cast gives "" The Yard "" a true flavor of the perverse nature of favoritism from Faye Dunaway and James Caan to Ellen Burstyn and Charlize Theron (in a surprisingly youthful dark mascara look). Great performances from Charlize Theron and James Caan as well. The story - telling appears to go at a snails pace, but thats ok, because the story - tellers (the actors) are more than enthralling enough to entertain for the whole 110 minutes."
2472,"Next Friday is actually pretty funny even though it lacks the film's first scene stealer Chris Tucker. Ice Cube makes a funny script with the help of new scene stealer Mike Epps who plays his cousin Day - Day. There are some more funny characters in this movie such as Pinky the owner of the record store that Day Day works at and the three Mexican brothers who like to start trouble. Some nice jokes, especially the joker brother, and ice cube was very funny to. However, there are some seriously funny things that you can't help but laugh at."
2482,"Everything about the film was terrific. Kevin Bacon is broad yet poignant, with a bold mood of a father in the 40's. The movie's beginning and its ending are its best moments. You'll laugh and chances are you could shed some tears as well, but it's all worth it in the long run. The film features beautiful and captivating performances by everyone in the cast."
2483,"There are enough positives to make it worthwhile. Angela Bassett is, as usual, excellent, and Peter Facinelli and Wilson Cruz are both worth watching. As far as Science Fiction movies go, this is definitely one of the better ones, maybe the best in recent memory. James Spader's characterization of Nick Vanzant is nice and complex. Supernova is a perfect example of a studio screwing up everything."
2509,"A great performance from Mr. Winkler, and he is quickly putting the ghost of Fonzie behind him. None of the cast really put their heart into it and the end result is a film that doesn't really do anything but still seems to take forever to finish! It is rare for romantic comedies to be entirely original [they are after all dealing with love], but Down to You does have it's moments differing it from most of the recently released teen comedies [to which it has constantly been compared]. Yet another Freddie Prinze Jnr - lead teen romance comedy about two college students, Alec (Prinze Jnr) and Imogen (Julia Stiles, Save The Last Dance) who fall in love, and experience the highs and lows of being in a serious relationship. First of all you need strong or likeable characters as the style is basically requiring some degree of interest of empathy from the first second."
3017,"The original Urban Legends was okay - not great, just entertaining. It was really funny in some places and the black security guard was a hoot baby! Reese, the female campus security cop from the original, returns in this film as the a new security guard on this campus, and does give a few laughs with her "" Foxy Brown "" imitations. "" Urban Legends: Final Cut "" is a wannabee "" Scream "" for a more miniature audience (i. e. 12 +) it tries to be clever and sometimes it is but it is fun throughout and never dull. Music composer John Ottman and editor for Bryan Singer films, tries his hand at directing and does a reasonable job with this entertaining derivative meta slasher."
2513,"It was basically a huge pile of rocks where she sat to clear her mind and relax. Some were minor parts, but all did an excellent job. Nathan Lane is great as Mansfield and Stockard Channing (as her best friend) and David Hyde Pierce (as her publisher) are hysterical and offer strong support. He ably plays straight man (hmm), setting up her best bits, and pitching lines to the fabulous Stockard Channing. The clothing, the celebrities, the zeitgeist of the time are pretty good."
2803,"Owen Wlson and Lucy Liu also are two big reasons this film became so popular. He brings an honesty to his otherwise shifty personae in everything he does. But as his friendship with Chan grows stronger, he realizes that money isn't everything. And as great as Chan is, and as much as he carries most films he's in with his sweet charms and likable personas, Wilson comes across as equally likable as Chan. Saloons, brothels and even wilderness settings are used with great success."
2545,"Courtney Cox is excellent as always as Gale Weathers. That is thanks largely to the brilliant casting of the satiric roles belonging to Parker Posey and Jenny McCarthy. David Arquette also gave a good performance, along with the rest of the cast. While the transporting of the story to Hollywood, with its movie within a movie structure, is fresh and adds a new dimension to proceedings. New additions to the scary fun are Patrick Dempsey, Emily Mortimer, Lance Henriksen and the afore mentioned Parker Posey, and all of them add greatly to the mysterious plot unfolding."
2548,Their scenes together are some of the best moments of the film. Liam Neeson's Charlie is one of the funniest roles he has done in his career. He is one of Canada's best exports and very believable in whatever part he plays. Jose Zuniga and Micahel DeLorenzo are hilarious as a pair of gay drug dealers. The group therapy sessions involving Charlie and other law enforcing people are fun to watch.
2551,"It takes a wonderful actor to be able to portray an emotion such as insanity just with his eyes, and he did so wonderfully! Still, the most important thing about Richard, Zeph and Sammy is intact. The whole thing looks great and DiCaprio's star power and charisma helps keep the audience with him, it's just that the actual story doesn't quite have the rich feeling or depth that the tourist - film location does. Director Boyle's direction is visually good too â€“ whether it be drawing style from scenes or contrasting the city with the island or doing imaginative things like computer game style images, he does work well. Danny Boyle's direction is solid and he paces the film nicely, and the script is adapted well from Alex Garland's better - than - movie book."
2552,"A young girl who will try anything to get that extra snow day and a meteorologist who just wants the like light he so much deserves. If you're willing to open yourself up to this concept, that a snow day is a magical wonderful time when anything can happen, you'll probably enjoy this fun feel good movie. Any kid who has ever dreamt of a snowday will enjoy this movie. Evidently those that didn't enjoy this movie never had the dream of a snowday. The kids taking over the snow plow man's truck and creating an additional snowday is great!"
2553,"It's fun for kids and pleasant viewing for adults, too. The kids will enjoy it, and the adults will, too. So, this movie decides to expand on one of the staple features of the great Tigger. The songs are original and funny, and even have subtle references that older viewers will catch (they are NOT inappropriate in any way) and younger ones will miss, which allows many age levels to enjoy it. "" The Tigger Movie "" is a great addition to the Disney library for fans of Winnie the Pooh."
2558,"The large and well - selected cast turned in very powerful performances. Ben Affleck (as Jim Young), Nicky Katt (as Greg Weinstein), and Vin Diesel (as Chris Varick) provide the standout efforts of this ensemble cast. Along with his work in "" Good Will Hunting, "" this is one of the best performances of his interesting on - screen career. Giovanni Ribisi makes a good appearance, and Nia Long needs to be in more movies. The film really captures the desires of society and gives them a face."
2559,"There were some surprise performances as well. Not only does he make the funniest, sometimes vulgar and off - color, wisecracks but he's so likable. Ryan, Keaton, Kudrow and Matthau pore on the charm and play off each other nicely. It's very touching to see how the two of them stick with each other through thick and thin, even through Dad's messy alcoholic rages. It's a fun, light comedic / dramatic flick, full of flashbacks, with hilarious cutouts."
2560,"They've got long, horizontal heads like a hammerhead, the quick - moving agility of the aliens, and the stealth of a Predator. But what makes this movie shine above others, is it's well - written characters. The look of the movie is breath taking, the contrast of blues, yellows and oranges due to the three different suns is amazing. If you don't normally watch SF movies this is definitely one to consider, and if you like SF horror this is a must see - in fact true horror buffs might find it tame. Fry (Radha Mitchell) is a character who, as Johns so nicely expressed, looked to her thine own ass first before considering the consequences."
2561,"THE WHOLE NINE YARDS (2000) ** Matthew Perry, Bruce Willis, Natasha Henstridge, Amanda Peet, Michael Clarke Duncan, Rosanna Arquette, Kevin Pollak, Harlan Williams. Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry were just the most perfect choices, they were like ying and yang. It's the magic of the movies. And it's the little, seemingly insignificant things he brings to the character that give the film that extra something and creates some memorable moments. Matthew Perry is in full panic - mode, and his reactions to the situations he finds himself in (and their resulting consequences) are hilarious."
2563,It was hard to watch the needles in the beginning. a great example that you can make a good flick on a small budget (and vice-versa). Schools and drug awareness programs should use this film!
2572,"It ends up being their individual charms that make REINDEER come out a winner. Of course, not everything in the film is effective. There are many great twists at the end which leads to an unpredictable, although somewhat unbelievable, ending. The final scenes are a great touch after the explosions, a nice touch to an enjoyable film. This is one of the most far - fetched, laugh - inducing premises since "" Dressed To Kill ""!"
2573,"The film has some very strong and witty dialogue, and benefits from great performances all around. He deserved his Oscar for Wall Street, commanded every second of screen time he had in Falling Down, and has given some of the most underrated comic performances in history in Romancing the Stone and War of the Roses. throw in an eccentric writing protege (Tobey Maguire), Tripp's bi-sexual literary agent (Robert Downey, Jr.) and his transvestite date, and you've got quite an interesting mix of characters. Then there's Terry Crabtree, the "" sometimes "" gay played beautifully by Robert Downey Jr. . which is too bad, really, because the scenes she does have are good."
2575,"Nevertheless it is a successful little film in its own terms and has a lot of gentle humor in it. His performance is tops in a stellar cast. In the recently released "" Isn't She Great "" she gets to play both sides of the ugly / beautiful coin and she does it here again brilliantly. The performances are perfect (with the exception of Campbell) and the dialogue is hysterical. The plot is engaging and fast - paced; the movies doesn't even come close to the two - hour mark."
2576,"If any of the subject matter interests you, and especially if you like Madonna, go and see it. All in all, a good storyline put to a bad script and bad performances. Anyone who tells you this is a great movie is obviously a star - struck Madonna fan. He is then - on top of everything - blamed with ruining Madonna Â´s life. Preferably with some unsuspecting friends and gallons of alcohol."
2577,"The script is a Shandlingesque miracle and the performances are perfect. If you want some big laughs. As far - fetched as it seems, it is the undertones and quiet moments in this film that render it watchable. OK, lets cast Fabio, for his looks and great comedic timing. She is what diversifies Shandling's occasionally monotonous character, and it is through her eyes that the film sheds its hokiness and becomes a real movie."
2595,"It's visually nice, and the performances are all good. There are some truly great moments in Mission to Mars. What truly makes this movie stand above others of its ilk is the great acting of the characters. The film features wonderful performances from its cast, an effective score by Ennio Morricone, and peerless direction from Brian De Palma. DePalma's talent for filming suspenseful action sequences is in full swing in this film."
2631,"This makes her accomplishments all the more amazing! The mood swings are effortless for her. Finney provides sterling support and his exchanges with Roberts provide some classic moments. Reluctantly he accepts and soon Brockovich finds herself uncovering a potentially huge case. Though some of her rants are over the top, they're really clever nonetheless."
2632,"' Final Destination' started off very promising especially before and during Alex's vision, and Devon Sawa does a great job. FINAL DESTINATION IS Different Nicely acted Filled with imaginative deaths FINAL DESTINATION IS NOT Low on suspense A typical teen horror Going to be shown as in - flight entertainment Some of the death scenes are pretty creative and terrifying, but some of them seemed to have been forced. Story is intriguing, the suspense flows well throughout, and there are enough violent deaths to satisfy the target audience. Final Destination, thanks to an imaginative story, nice acting and some elaborate death scenes breathes new life into the tired genre of teen horror."
2667,"Sure, it's silly, but it's never boring, there are some slick fight scenes, and the soundtrack is pretty neat. Lindo was good and Aaliyah was REALLY REALLY good. The excellent surround sound and sharp picture make it a good one for DVD. High end production values mean the film has a real style and "" gloss "" to it and everything fits in place and the story moves along at just the right pace. Some of the stunts were tremendous."
2668,"Leelee is a talented actress - in supporting roles. The overlook scenes were particularly lovely. Leelee Sobieski was as good in this as she was in Joan of Arc. But it is better than many of the "" teem movies "" made recently. Sam (Leelee Sobieski) is a small town girl whose big plans to go to UM on a track scholarship got waylayed by a knee injury."
2669,"It's up there w / Win a Date w / Tad Hamitlon & In Good Company. The beautiful people are very, and the nerds are unmistakable. Perhaps there's a new software product called InstaScript that's selling big in Hollywood. The jokes are at times really funny and at times a complete waist of time. And you'll love the way InstaScript fills in the other 90 minutes of your script by reusing classic movie scenes."
2671,"There is a superb screenplay and all the performers are excellent. Rarely can such emotions have been more compellingly and brilliantly portrayed on film. Some of these visions are so real, he begins to believe she's alive. A stunning movie directing by none other than the director of A Midnight Clear, another terrific film. Following in the big footsteps of "" The Chocolate War "", "" A Midnight Clear "" and "" Mother Night "", Waking the Dead "" is perhaps the most cohesive and satisfying film by Keith Gordon to date."
2691,"The casting was pheonimal, scenes perfectly picked, and music parallelling that of the mood set in the book. Love, life, relationships, music, movies, hobbies, jobs, ticks, ups, downs - everything is here. For music lovers who tend to put a soundtrack to everything they experience, this film is a blessing. The best scenes, however, are those in the record store - Todd Louiso and especially the utterly hilarious Jack Black steal every scene they're in. High Fidelity is a tale of human love and a love of music, a sort of battle of the sexes with a soundtrack of masculine life."
2692,"Dreamworks is a breath of fresh air in times like these, it would seem. The animation is stunning, the backgrounds are colourful, the colours are vibrant and the character movements are sharp. In conclusion, a visually audacious and fun Dreamworks film. Then there's Chel; the seducer from the city of gold, able to help the two (at a price). Of course the film is not without its fair share of eye - candy, the special effects were excellent and Dreamworks didn't go overboard with them."
2693,"; there's no graphic gore (or nudity); and the action scenes are well - done and exciting. A delightfully silly movie, it moves briskly through semi-serious conflicts and silly conspiracies, and all with the the intelligence of your average CBS movie of the week. Joshua Jackson (` Cruel Intentions', ` Urban Legend') is excellent as Luke. ***** MILD SPOILERS ***** According to the caption at the start of this film this is actually based on fact. The Skulls is a very intense movie that keeps the watcher interested."
2714,"And Caviezel's a real up - and - comer (1998's "" The Thin Red Line ""). ; Caviezel is equally good as the present day version of Quaid's character's son. What can safely be said is that Frequency achieves a rare feat of successfully blending genres and thematics. Speaking of the characters--Quaid and Caviezel both do great work. Frequency uses remarkable use of film's ability to stretch out moments of time and intercut between different events."
2715,"Arquette, Caan, and Platt make a nice trio, and Martin Landau is hilarious as an old - school wrestling guru. The act of watching this movie is as painful as the countless hits to the crotch the filmmakers thought were so amusing. King is a hero and role model to the boys from Lusk, who know him only from his television persona. This was light and enjoyable film of two affable wrestling fans who want to reinstate a recently fallen hero to the top of the WCW world. For true fans though the movie is even more funny because of all the inside jabs at the business."
2716,"David Duchovny is just plain hot. This is an excellent setup containing thoroughly developed characters, a clear dramatic premise, emotional and physical conflicts, and an unusual structure. David Duchovny's grief scene is so flippin real! David Duchovny shines in this movie! Likewise, the background performances are magically funny and heartwarming."
2717,"The performances of Tommy Lee Jones, Samuel L. Jackson and Guy Pearce were very good. Colonel played by S. L. Jackson is doing his best to have situation run smoothly. Marines are entrenched on the roof while crowd is raging beyond, targeted by some sporadic fire. There are some outstanding action scenes in the first 30 minutes and if you have a 5. Jackson's military hero is self evidently anything but, and Jones's about - to - retire - in - two - weeks - lawyer straight from a cupboard in central casting (the shelf below the about - to - retire - in - two - weeks detective)."
2732,"There is very interesting camera work and flashback scenes that work very well. It has its funny moments, so it's not entirely drama. Her withdrawals and agonies are realistic and knowledgeable. This is a drama which has many fine comedic moments. Gwen's experiences in rehab seem truthful and accurate."
2733,"He is completely believable in all his emotions. The director's cut is available on videocassette and DVD, which shows the film's three - way sex scene in more disturbing, yet innovative, detail. The production design, the cinematography, the visual effects, the engaging soundtrack, the quirks each actor masterfully incorporates with their character, and every other aspect of the film is flush in detail. Oh yeah, and it was directed by a woman, so all you feminists shut up! "" Patrick Bateman lives in a morally flat world in which clothes have more value than skin, objects are worth more than bones, and the human soul is something to be sought with knives and hatchets and drills . """
2734,"And what a delight Jenna Elfman is. They along with Jenna Elfman are agreeable, enticing and enjoyable. Good acting, good directing a good story and good everything. Norton's timing, both as a director and as an actor are magnificent, and Stiller and Elfman add to this shining cast. All this reflects well on Norton, who shows remarkable sensitivity as both a cowriter and director!"
2735,"The three main stars are likable, and of course Paul Newman is a jewel as always. Keep in mind, it's a mild hilarity and suspense, with subtle exchanges and real emotional investment. This it does with the help of its three dazzling stars, who seem to be having the time of their professional lives (Fiorentino is especially wonderful). He is fitter and more energetic than most men who are fifteen years his junior. Fiorentino is stunning at the end of the film."
2737,"Both entertaining and informative, "" The Filth and The Fury "" actually delivers as being "" the definitive story of The Sex Pistols "". His ability to display the true personalities of each band member is remarkable, and this has translated over to the audience. its an excellent piece of film making that tells the story of one of the most influential bands of the 70's, and indeed of rock history. One - to - one interviews with each surviving band member, as well as extensive interview footage with Sid Vicious (Hyde Park - 1978), are revealing and extremely honest. A warts and all look inside the lives of a band that changed the face of music forever."
2738,"Everyone and everything in the dream life represents something significant in the real life past. Demi Moore (looking angular and pale like Courteney Cox - Arquette, yet more flexible) is very fine as a woman living parallel lives, one of which is a dream - world. There is a lot of truth about relationships revealed here. The exterior locations looked trully beautiful and it Â´s a real viewing pleasure just to see a good story set against such beautiful images in the background. Surprisingly absorbing film that requires your patience (to let it unfold) and your attention (to capture all the nuances, and they are there)."
2749,"Notice how many right angles and sharp points are present in the party and residential settings. Norman Reedus puts a lot into his character that excels in the end. The first 80 minutes are well - conceived and intricately - plotted. In fact, the film is worth seeing for its locales alone. Both Marsden and Reedus are better actors than they are given credit for."
2750,"L&B is real, engaging, and enjoyable. The story is very well written and works on several levels - it refuses to be pinned down as simply a romance or drama, choosing instead a careful blending of different elements. There has been many love stories that are typical they meat fall in love and live happy for the rest of there lives, this movie shows the ups and downs of a relationship but still the bond between them is never broken. And the depths from where they came to where they ultimately went, from their beginnings as children to the adults they grew up into, was nothing short of amazing. Sanaa Lathan however, goes one step further, and demonstrates an intensity both on and off the court that puts her in a league all her own."
2751,"Where Das Boot puts grime, U-571 substitutes pretty faces. Where U-571 plays glorious fanfare, Das Boot counters with powerful silence. There were some tremendous daring - do escapades with memorable victories. It's a submarine movie with nonstop action and plenty of explosions. Of course America did a lot for ending the nazi - tyranny, but in this case, it was the achievement of english sailors and scientists."
2755,"The characters are solid, the performances are great, and the action is non-stop. There is some strong talent in the cast for a direct - to - video feature and the young leads of Mabius and Dunst {. Credit must go to Bharat Nalluri for making a cool looking movie with pretty cool camera work and effects and also credit Marco Beltrami for making a really good score that doesn't ape Graeme Revell's but is something all it's own. Eric Mabius as the central character shines throughtout. The look of Salvation is closer to part 1 than 2 was and yet it has a look all it's own, Salvation is grounded more in reality than the first 2 were but the city is still dark, gritty, and depressing, and the sets were cool."
2756,"Some of the double entrendres are cute, but they harmlessly go right over the kid's head. For what it is, this is a great little movie, and compared to the first one (sheesh) it TOTALLY rocks ("" rocks "". Try to improve and get good reviews. ( Yes, that can happen because that is the reason why the 1998 film "" Madeline "" got a PG rating) Genre (s): Family, Comedy, Romance, Based on a TV show (The Flintstones animated series of the 60's) Summary: It is basically a prequel of the 1994 underrated hit. The dating sequence is cute and the Vegas arrival scene has some clever sight gags, but these were fleeting montages."
2757,"The remainder of the film examines the various relationships and experiences she has in this small town over the next seven or eight years. The choice of actors is superb, and the direction is wonderful. Stockard Channing was wonderful as the eccentric Welcome Wagon lady. Portman has a unique look of innocence that cannot be pulled off by many actresses as she does with her character, Novalee Nation. Lexie Coop (Ashley Judd) becomes Novalee's best friend when they meet in the hospital after Novalee has her baby."
2759,"Jobim's music, by the way, is the perfect choice. Rio, on the other hand, is a city filled with unique beauty, as anyone who has ever been to Sugarloaf or Corcavado can attest to. Faguendes is obviously a well - known, beloved actor in his home country. All this plays out against an almost idyllic backdrop of sand dunes, towering mountains, charming cafes and crashing surf. However there's plenty of good acting and funny moments."
2762,"In one of the closing scenes, Jeanne Tripplehorn is clinging on to a nearby bannister while you can see cars in the background moving along smoothly. But none of this detracts from a truly great achievement from all involved - for actors to go 93 minutes undisturbed is very impressive. And then to have such a dramatic climax at the end of 93 improvised minutes is pretty mind - blowing. The material is engaging to a degree, the actors perform it very well and everything is down - to - earth to preserve its sense of realism. If you watch all these behind - the - scenes specials with actors stumbling line - after - line, doing take - after - take, until they finally get it right the 100th time--it's astounding to see that the whole cast was able to pull this off without a scratch."
2769,"Richard Harris and Oliver Reed were exceptional in what will be remembered as crowning achievements at the end of their careers. Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Russell Crowe, Djimon Housou and Joaquin Phoenix are also superb and the parts suit them perfectly. In short, the actors were brilliant in their roles, not over-acting, but giving subtle, strong performances. Possibly one of the greatest actors today, Crowe carries this epic film on his very capable shoulders."
2770,"Kim Basinger was excellent as Kuki. The scenes of dead elephants made the statement in a poignant way, much better than any dialogue could have. The performances were very good in this Movie (including a pre-bond outing for Daniel Craig with an excellent South African accent) Vincent Perez was excellent as Kuki Gallman's Husband Paolo. This film deserved more positive reviews than it had. Given the circumstances and scenery, this movie should have been fascinating, but it tedious."
2771,"A noble thing to have, unless your naivety of heart gets you into places you never dreamed your heart would lead you. E. P. Beauchene In a nutshell, Mary, (Kristin Scott Thomas), a distractingly beautiful English widow has more heart than mind in this period piece. He was absolutely brilliant in Dead Man Walking and Carlito's Way, to name just two. Sean Penn is one of the finest actors in Hollywood today. The only reason to see UP AT THE VILLA is the performances by a wonderful cast."
2778,"Pretty good for a guy whose most advanced tools were sticks and rocks earlier in the film. In fact, opening night, in a packed theater, people started laughing out loud about 20 minutes into the film and never really stopped. The aliens are essentially just people with dreadlocks and slightly bigger, hairier hands with an extra finger and apparently they're also really stupid. Earth has been occupied for a thousand years by these aliens and they are still here, searching for gold. Finally, stay true to the idiotic gibberish you based the film on in the first place, and you've got the makings of a rolling - on - the - floor comedy."
2779,"It was full of surprises and excitement. It shows a splendid direction of the excellent Nycholas Hytner. Zoe Saldana is very good and is perhaps the most complex character. There's Charlie (Sascha Radetsky), the perfect good guy. There was a cast of amazing dancers showing the best of them in just a few minutes."
2780,"It might be a tad funnier but both very rough comedies make you laugh--and isn't that enough sometimes? However, "" Screwed "" has one major element that makes it effective: the movie induces some big laughs. There were some solid laughs too and seeing Dave Chappelle, Danny DeVito, and Norm McDonald all on the same screen was just baller, especially to look back on it now. Norm Macdonald once again proves he cannot act worth a hill of beans, but he sure provokes amusing material through his character. His friend (Dave Chappelle) lends him a hand and soon are the subject of a nationwide manhunt!"
2781,"But after a while, everything Murray says is funny - intenionally or otherwise. The standouts are Sam Sheppard as the Ghost, Steve Zahn and Dechen Thurman as Rosencrnatz & Guildenstern, and especially Liev Schrieber as Laertes. Omissions are inevitable lest the movie runs 4 hours, but it should be done with great care. ') But it is an honest attempt to cast the reflexive depth of the play in cinematic terms. The director, Michael Almereyda, has cut into the script and most of the film runs surprising lean for something that runs one hour, fifty - three minutes."
2794,"As good as everyone of their Classics are based or inspired by other works. Thankfully, it's not excessively sugar - coated and there are some very sad scenes but it beautifully ends on the note of hope. The dionsaurs merge seemlessly into the real surroundings, and they move and look absolutely real. Thus, it's not for the smallest children, but it's a great story that treats it's audience with respect and pays homage to that great lost Earth that was buried in the dust millions of years ago. Aladar's selfless attempts to save the dinosaur's are touching to watch as it reflects how the kind - hearted Plio raised him."
2795,"It relies on little sex and profanity, but instead has its success rooted firmly in the acting and charisma of young stars Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari. There're nice performances from Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari who do the main characters. Lets you smile throughout, and gives you some insights into contemporary life on campus without resorting to cliches. The film centers around Paul Tannek (Jason Biggs), an all - around nice guy from a small town who is now going to college in a big city due to a scholarship he's received. another teen / young adult college comedy coming your way, spiced up with a little romance, the usual boy - meets - girl - falls - in - love - but - she's - already - with - someone storyline, and that's really all there is to tell, aside from a few notable college pranks that kinda make you wonder what _ you _ did with your time back then."
2796,"One of the best comedies of the year. There are a lot of road movies, but this is the very best one. On the way, they get into some hysterical situations and give great comedic performances. For the first time in a long while, this film is entirely honest and not at all patronising. Not a movie for date night, but a good choice for gathering around the tube with bongs, brews, and bros. ."
2797,"She matches Allen laugh - for - laugh in here and, in some respects, even steals the show. A movie with great, seamless performances, a solid story, and a hysterical script. This is the kind of movie that relies on situations to pull its characters through the story, and Allen gives the script fresh twists, active subplots, and creativity. Also decently developed is the story, with a clear, stable first act and early laughs to capture the audience's attention from the start. The cast are all superb, from Tracey Ullman to Hugh Grant, even Woody gives one of his best performances of his career."
2802,"Nyah, the chick in MI2, is a perfect example of this. Rhames is good and Hopkins has an enjoyable minor role. More realism in that 40 minutes would have made this a far better film than it turned out to be. The first film was a tight, smooth thriller that barreled along at warp speed, and was a nice break from conventional Hollywood action thrillers. Thandie Newton is attractive heroine and Dougray Scott is satisfactory as the main villain."
2816,"If viewed on those terms then it can be enjoyed. The looks of Lawrence's face during that period were hilarious! Cue many moments of roll - in - the - aisles hilarity. Sure some of the gags are puerile, and Lawrence is an acquired taste, tho his energy and comedy timing are first rate here. This movie is actually funny, hysterically so in a few scenes."
2876,"In spite of problems, the characters are effective due to the top notch, perfectly cast performers responsible. gone in 60 seconds is a very good action comedy film that made over $100 million but got blasted by most critics. Giovanni Ribisi, Scott Caan, Robert Duvall, Will Patton, and Christopher Eccleston provide persuasive supporting roles. The film is a pleasure to look at and although one particular scene takes you into the realm of unbelieveablity, the action is non-stop and the suspense is compelling. But the film has style and a good pace, with some great theft scenes, well - spotted humor, and a final chase that (while not among the greatest ever filmed) is certainly a wild ride."
2878,"It is classically campy with delightful bits of direction augmented by stunning costume and decoration. Branagh does his best as Berowne, and so do others. Another highlight was Geraldine McEwan who played her small role as Holofernia perfectly! The costumes and art direction are appropriately light and beautiful, and some of the comedy moments are quite fun. The reviewers either loved or hated it."
2879,"The Trixie character is very original and inviting. , Ms. Watson rattles off these lines without a trace of affectation or laugh calculation, which makes them work so beautifully. She gives Trixie a naÃ¯ve charm and gritty determination that is fun to watch. The aforementioned Ms. Warren turns in her usual strong performance. Her timing is perfect and Ms. Watson's performance is endearing."
2905,"-- Movies like this are good, if that is what you're looking for. OK, Jim Carrey fans, this is Jim doing some of his very best work. Jim Carrey is brilliant in his role as both "" Hank "" and "" Charlie . "" Renee Zellwegger is lovely and sexy. Jim Carrey is in his hilarious comic form."
2900,"The ending may have been predictable but it was uplifting and very sweet and even though it's just a film you come out feeling optimistic that maybe happy endings do exist. Each character has their own unique quirks that make the viewing experience that much more enjoyable. Freddie Prinze Jr. and Claire Forlaini have wonderful chemistry and are fun to watch (especially in the dance club scene). If you want a little escape from life for a few hours, this movie is just the light, enjoyable distraction you could be looking for. Ryan's best friend and Jennifer's best friend are played by Jason Biggs and Amanda Detmer with whimsical freedom."
2901,"Well, three performances to be precise. Worth a watch but keep expectations low. Enjoyed Jackson in this mucho, this is some fine work by a kinetic actor in his prime. Oh, and it features Lynne Thigpen, who played the DJ in The Warriors (1979) and as The Warriors is an excellent and highly realistic depiction of New York in the seventies. Samuel L. Jackson is truly a great Shaft, he's probably the only actor out there (besides the great Richard Roundtree) who could pull this off, and he does an excellent job."
2902,"The story goes places and uses the chosen technology very nicely. Titan A. E is a great film. even with all those dread monsters hot on his very tail! ( If anything, they look more simple) This film, as cliched as the story was, was visually inspired. It brought about some great 3D rendering in a time where animation was primarily 2D."
2904,"She doesn't have much dialogue, but definitely does the most with the least as she delivers the funniest lines in the movie with aplomb. While most of the chickens are resigned to their fate, one plucky hen named Ginger keeps leading escape attempts and keeps getting locked in "" solitary "" for her pains. This is one of those rare films in which both the heroes and the villains are fun to watch. Directors Peter Lord and Nick Park both have considerable experience in this field, Park with "" Creature Comforts "" and the "" Wallace & Gromit "" series (perhaps the most popular animated shorts of the 1990's) and Lord as a co-founder (with David Sproxton) of Aardman and director of such shorts as "" Adam "", "" Wat's Pig "", and "" Early Bird "". Movie buffs can try to count the references to The Great Escape, Stalg 17, Star Trek and Braveheart and may be pleasantly surprised at the quality of the camera work."
2906,"The wide - open vistas and battle scenes were breath - taking and beautifully filmed. One newspaper accused it of blackening the character of the British officer Banastre Tarleton who served as the inspiration for the villainous Colonel Tavington. This is especially true in movies like The Patriot which' pretend' to be real. Not even the overtly flag waving and sloganeering on show can off set the impact of the well constructed battles. Some major battle scenes, some drama, the obvious patriotism, some decent acting ,."
2907,"First of all, it should be noted that the film makers here had respect and affection for the source material, and it shows. Expect to see this screened at around lunchtime on Bank Holidays for years to come. And as the story goes, the laughs and silliness get even worse. The film uses the technique of putting animated characters in real - live settings and real actors. Movies that aren't serious can be really fun, this one however is an exception from that statement."
2908,"Combine all of this with the best special effects imaginable, outstanding performances, and a terrific score by John Horner, and you're in for the thrill of a lifetime. Over-the-top dialogue is turned a notch - up by overer - the - top acting. "" The Perfect Storm "" may be considered one of the great sea movies Casting and acting by all involved was perfect and you never once feel like anything is overacted or overly dramatic, just that you are somehow involved with the fear that had to have been involved on that night. The performances and the script are strong and the characters very well realized (though fictionalized)."
2926,"His acclaim, he is Russell Duritz, he knows what it takes to make it. Both movies are engaging on more than one level. The film did an excellent job in explain all these questions. This gives Russ a second chance to make things right. The Kid is a nice, heart - warming movie for everyone."
2927,"` Scary Movie' is, at least, blessed with a winning, game cast made up of appropriately post adolescent actors who understand well the mannerisms and speech patterns of the stereotypes they embody. Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans and boasting a screenplay concocted by no fewer than six (count â€˜ em SIX) writers, ` Scary Movie' establishes a high speed rhythm and pace that the filmmakers manage to sustain through most of the film's 88 - minute running time â€“ though there is a noticeable tendency on the part of the film to lag in the last half hour. The cast, for mostly unknowns, is good, and it was nice to see the Wayans clan finally succeed in film, after about a decade of poorly self - written clunkers. It's a take on all the recent teen horror flicks, and it does it superbly well. This opening sets the tone for an engrossing comedy and viewers are thrust head first into typical teenagers lives, filled with some fine slapstick humour and stereotypes lives There is a consistency to Scary Movie."
2932,"Anywayz, this is very well done in terms of casting, lighting performance, music, tone and everything. With a $500000 budget, this is tops. Performances are generally strong, and some of the use of sound is superb, such as when the main protagonist is' coming up'. After an amazing night of "" everything "", you have to realize that it's all over and life must goes on. These intimate underground parties are truly a positive unifying force; bringing all sorts of people together through music."
2935,"All in all, X-Men was excellent. Director Brian Singer (Usual Suspects) did a good job with what he's got. She will undoubtedly grow into the part in future movies. "" X-Men "" is smart, stylish, and very cool. There will be plenty of time to develop new characters in the forthcoming sequels."
2936,"This allows the viewer to better identify with their own similar experiences. He catches perfectly a guy verging on the mentally retarded with some severe emotional problems, but whose nervous twitches and stammering speech are also strangely endearing and charming. This is a thrilling tale, and it is difficult to see it as the comedy that IMDb has labeled. Cast-wise good support all round particularly Lupe Ontiveros as Beverly, recruited by Buck to help produce and direct his play "" Hank and Frank "". "" Chuck & Buck "" is something a little different, and that's always a plus, but from the overly - giddy music to the brackish photography--with the camera always pulled in too close to the actors' faces--it's rather an obnoxious combination of sentiment and off - putting drama (it seems designed to be these things intentionally)."
2938,"As a refreshing change to more formulaic chillers, WLB takes its time to build the suspense. It's a fine enough film in its own right, regardless of the Hitchcockian homages. By the finale, so many gimmicks are being thrown at the screen, it just becomes an upscale B - flick. The strength of the film exists in the the technical construction and how precisely orchestrated it is to get the most emotional impact from the various moments in the film. It is interesting to revisit the archived reviews available at EbertandRoeper."
2953,"Apparently audience wanted to see moving mouths. This is the most popular character for children ages 2 - 6. He's NEVER liked anything so much - he talks about it, laughs during it and is fascinated by it. And the film score by composer Hummie Mann was done brilliantly. Mann is able to combine all the right tones with each scene and it even includes The Shining Time theme song in his tracks as a reoccurring theme."
2954,"Eddie Murphy is an exceptionally talented man - no doubts. are now being done with big budgets, famous stars, and sold as lovable time. Still, this had a decent share of funny moments. He's a funny guy, and he has come further than he ever has had before with NUTTY II. Look how many family movies Murphy had to make right after it: Shrek (2001), Dr. Dolittle 2 (2001), Daddy Day Care (2003), The Haunted Mansion (2003), Shrek 2 (2004), and Imagine That (2009)."
2957,"Both Gere and Winona gave excellent performances. Chen uses shadings and reflections beautifully. But it is well - acted (Ryder and Gere give two of their best performances) and it looks beautiful. Winona is as beautiful as ever and gives one of her best performances. The rest of the cast members, including Anthony LaPaglia, Sherry Stringfield, and Elaine Stritch, are great."
2958,Piper Perabo is an incredible find. Perabo is so easy to like. The dance numbers and bar scene were very realistic. Perabo is an excellent actor with tremendous ability and potential. It is an amiable film that sparkles with energy and is easy to watch.
2959,"The action is intense and the chills are true. Visually, it is quite appealing and effective, and the soundtrack (especially the opening themes played over some effective and atmospheric opening credits) does a great job of adding some "" oomph "" to the action of screen. But then again he's invisible right, he can do anything he wants. It's nice to see technology has finally made it so that they can do just about anything you can think of in film. A really good special effects movie as long as you don't expect anything more."
2960,"The sets and special effects were very convincing and Eastwood seems to be good at both the artistic and technical aspects of directing. There's great chemistry between the stars as well. Add Marcia Gay Harden to the mix, along with Loren Dean, Courtney Vance and James Cromwell and you have a fabulous cast. and a lot of what surprises everyone in the film seems telegraphed. Eastwood and scriptwriters Ken Kaufman and Howard Klausner find a nice balance between the film's various modes."
2961,"In fact, it is Danny and Lucy's dance sequences that charm the most. Although Keri Russell's Irish accent may not have achieved the subtle nuances of an Irish native, she did a fine job! William Ash fares well as Danny, but Keri Russell's feisty female lead, Lucy, is probably the biggest highlight of the film. And William Ash (the soccer' Mambo king') and Brian Cox (as Keri's father) were fine as well! Ireland's beauty is challenged only in this movie by Keri Russell's."
2962,"The most notable quality about "" Saving Grace "" is its likability. Every character is extremely sympathetic, and, save for the first 20 or so minutes, the film is non-stop good cheer. Brenda Blethyn is faultless as always and the ensemble cast are superb. The rest of the ensemble cast fits in this category as well, but special mention has to go to Tcheky Karyo. Saving Grace is a nice movie to watch in a boring afternoon, when you are looking for something different than the regular scripts and wants to have some fun."
2980,"Her timing is impeccable, her imitations uproarious, and her candor admirable. When she gets into the meat of the show ("" The All American Girl "" incident), that is where she excels. This is not to say that this movie isn't funny, there are some bits that are absolutely hilarious. This concert keeps getting better, with the funniest of the jokes becoming staples in Cho's repertoire. And beyond the content of her work, Cho is a master of her craft, a genius manipulator of silence, long - held muggy faces, microphone - stand grasps, lunges for the water bottle, and sheer stillness."
2981,"One of the best films (and comedies) of this year (or any). He quickly dismisses any doubts with his impeccable timing, both dramatic and comedic, which garnered him the Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. "" Tao's "" success is twofold: it boasts a tight, witty script - how many romantic comedies can you think of that are peppered with quotations from Lao Tzu? thanks so much to Greer and Jenniphr Goodman for their script and direction. Ottawa born Donal Logue, pulled a DeNiro, gaining 45 - pounds for the role of Dex - now that's dedication to the craft."
2982,"The story is classic good vrs. When Cody gets discovers that she has special powers and abilities, she is targeted by a cult led by her sister's fiance, Eric Stark (Rufus Sewell). What seems to have peeved many of the reviewers is that "" good, "" in the form of a little girl (Holliston Coleman), was actually presented as having some real (and quiet) strength for a change. A little bit of horror thrown in for good measure, and some thrilling sequences - and you got a good movie. Bless the child is full of new or unknown actors, but reguardless it is well acted."
2983,"But watch closely for an absolutely glowing performance by Gyllenhaal. Any film with Alicia Witt and Maggie Gyllenhaal has very good things going for it visually. Energy and originality are in fact the hallmarks of this film from start to finish. If you are a fan of underground movies, you will love this one! "" Cecil B. Demented "" is wild, original and often funny."
2984,"Yet, underneath all the gobs of makeup, and quite aside from her flair for showmanship, she was a person of humanity, love, and compassion, and as such, a credit to the human race. The filmmakers, whilst it appears at time are getting their kicks out of putting Tammy Faye on the big screen, are (for the most part) sincere in their telling of the tale. Her very â€˜ un-Christian' views about gay people show an amazing amount of personal integrity and strength. She was a one - of - a kind person, someone unique in popular culture. "" The Eyes Of Tammy Faye "", a documentary about the little lady with the big eyelashes, the running mascara, and the child like voice, likewise presents a woman who was sincere, surprisingly intelligent, energetic, persevering, and of course."
2985,"By the way, Walken is excellent. It is then something of a miracle that "" The Opportunists "" works as well as it does. Christopher Walken, Cyndi Lauper, along with the entire cast, are excellent. This movie was paced really well and the characters were are very believable. The scenes and dialogue are carefully crafted and the film as a whole is very well cast and acted."
2986,"Some may even take a "" message "" away, about the importance of teamwork, belief in oneself, true love (QB and the head cheerleader). He hired 45 professional football players (Former NFL players, Canadian Football League, etc.) to do the football scenes and sent the actors to a three - week football camp. The players were told to play and hit the way they normally would. And that is just what makes "" The Replacements "" work so well. In this film you have to watch those eyes that are so eloquent when he's discouraged and listen to those little expelled breaths that convey so well (and so humorously) his state of mind when he's near the girl he's finds attractive."
2987,"Each dream sequence is like a nightmare - ish painting in motion, from the landscapes to the costumes. This is boldness at work, pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. And so begins a strange array of visuals and sounds, blended together so unusually that you honestly feel like you're experiencing a dream Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn and Vincend D'Onofrio. Vince Vaughn delivers another of his characteristically excellent performances (he was even good as Norman Bates in the pathetic 1998 re-make of Psycho), and even Jennifer Lopez puts forth the second good effort of her career (the other being the great Out of Sight)."
2989,"There are some nice reaction shots of the crowd, who are clearly having a great time, and the way that the laughter of the onscreen audience blends with that of the people in the theatre really makes you feel like you're part of the show. Hughley was funny as well, especially when he was interacting with the audience. If you enjoy stand up - these were certainly the "" Kangs "" - as Steve said :) They take you back to recall your history, childhood, life. But it's chock - full of laughs, magnetism, and good, rollicking fun. What these men were doing with comparing black and white is NO DIFFERENT than when Jeff Foxworthy compares and contrasts rednecks and sophisticated people."
2998,"Everything is slick and well shot. There are many great moments of action in "" The Art of War . "" though it does have a few scenes with strain believability a bit. ART, with all its chase scenes and fight sequences (and there are a truck load), is beautifully shot. but it should have enough twists and turns to keep you guessing."
2999,"Folk was a musical movement born in backwaters and the public squares of melting pot cities, of the fusion of cultures - black and rural, diverse and rich as the world - into the raw stuff of entertainment. both were musicians, primarily, and the music in both docs is wonderful to hear and remember, especially for those who were there for the 1960's and remember it well, and miss it. It's a true, genuine, open statement about a man who has lived his life with absolutely no plan in mind about what he would do or say or where his choices would take him or what effect it would have on other people or things, but never hesitated to follow his heart, follow his curiosity, outrun his shadow with every step. Elliott, fashioning himself after, as protÃ©gÃ© of, Guthrie, was one of the first to imagine and create the role of the American minstrel from which innumerable others have borrowed and to this day continue to borrow. Another worth seeing, which shows the same thing (a 60's guy who never left the 1960's, even in his old age) is the documentary titled "" George Harrison: Living In The Material World "" (2011)."
3000,"They have screen presence and should be in front of the camera for many years to come, especially Elisa, who is really very beautiful. In BRING IT ON, all of the cheerleaders are fully developed amazingly nice looking So - Cal starlets. The film's brisk pacing was perfectly suited to its theme, thanks to director Peyton Reed, the writing smart, sharp, and consistently and authentically funny, (as well as, at times, genuinely thought - provoking) thanks to writer Jessica Bendinger, and the acting solid all around. Director Peyton Reed and screenwriter Jessica Bendinger (who tried to reheat her formula for 2006's "" Stick It "") favor bigness when it comes to the antics contained in "" Bring It On . "" The smart folks behind Bring It On, though, realized that if they could strike a certain balance they could fulfill expectations but also get their point across."
3002,"Interesting film following the romances of a journalist. Valerie Breiman treats the subject of love and sex with almost the perfect balance. The actors have great chemistry and the writing is often delightfully fresh. But ok, its a movie, and a lot of things in life, ecspecially in relationships will have you sayin, "" What are the odds? "" A more experienced director could have played up the many one liners and the countless funny moments from Kate's love life."
3003,"Both were excellent organizers and people. And D'Onofio is great as Hoffman himself - fiery, passionate and very effective. However, that said, the film has value for providing a visual picture of the times and occurrences of Abbie's life. D'Onofrio is excellent in the lead role. Jeanine Garofolo gives a flawless performance as Anita."
3004,"Anyway, the story in this one is good and it tidies up everything rather nicely at the end. Another two characters worth mentioning are Rachel (the late Sheila Gish) and Heather (Beatie Edney), who appear again in a "" Highlander "" film. Overall the Scottish Passion was Great and The Mix in Styles When People Fought Showed Great Strengh in Depfh. The last installment of the Highlander movie series is a brilliant blend of the original movie and the popular television characters. Bruce Payne, playing the embittered Jacob Kell, provides a fine interpretation that is however in the line of the other "" Highlander "" villains."
3005,"Ja Rule did a great job in his first role and had some great lines to work with. Pras and his lady - friend are about the ONLY people among the masses that look as though they know what they're doing. The only good thing about this movie was the scoring by Frank Fitzpatrick, other than that. A couple of good points on the black music industry (literaly and figuratively) and a couple of stand out performances are cluttered by a lame excuse for a music video plot. It was straight to DVD at best."
3006,"One of the best parts to this is the mystery angle that's played up about what the practice is really doing and who's involved, generating some tension to this one later on. At least they aren't the increasingly boring high school type characters), and yes, some are lusty (basically the character played by Anna Loos is, and it is handled quite tastefully in the German language version), but Anatomy is well constructed, there is a tense mood throughout, the sets are amazing, the makeup effects are a wow, and Franka Potente is very credible in her role. It is a bit mature in mind, as it doesn't resort to constant opportunities for sexual encounters (a breast fest) or juvenile drug jokes. What starts of as a reasonably captivating little thriller derails completely by the third act and becomes a carbon copy of any other slasher film made, which is a shame as if the film just stayed on target, it would've been something special, as the acting was good into then and the camera - work was pretty good throughout. The fact that it does this is actually a fun idea, as there's plenty to be crept out at by the rather large amount of time spent among cadavers, which is enough on it's own but here, using the practice is where it really scores a lot of great scenes where she's investigating them."
3007,"This has to be one of the best cast films in recent years. The brilliant script is by John C. Richards. Greg Kinnear and the supporting cast that includes Tia Texado, Allison Janney, Aaron Eckhart, Kathleen Wilhoite and Crispin Glover are all good. But such contrivances should be written off as poetic license and ignored. Renee Zellwegger is perfect for Nurse Betty, with the constant gleam in her eye that pushes her in her quest."
3008,"But then impressive high technology is not unique to movies. Gotta own it on DVD. No, he's not doing anything different with it from anyone else who plays this type of serial killer role but he is still charismatic enough to make a difference. The film has interesting things to say about anonymity in modern societies, especially big cities. The Watcher follows its two main characters intimately, often detailing the mechanics of Griffin's moves through Campbell's point of view as an observer who must solve a mystery."
3009,"The guys soon find themselves embroiled in a chinese puzzle of relationships including ruthless bodyguards Jeffers (Taye Digs -' Go') and Obecks (Nicky Katt -' SubUrbia' ,' The Limey'), and Chidduck's bagman and troubleshooter, the complex Sarno (the legendary James Caan -' The Godfather' ,' Thief'), and Sarno's colleague Abner (frequent Clint Eastwood sidekick, and Juliet's real life father, Geoffrey Lewis). Here, Christopher McQuarrie presents a whole lotta extra treats, whilst never losing his grip upon tension or bloody spectacle. Benicio Del Toro has this presence about him that radiates "" coolness "", and Ryan Phillippe did a remarkable job as well with his role. Benicio Del Toro was probably the best as his expressions and just the way he says things is unbeatable. Were this all that Chris provided in the way of innovation, it'd still be mightily impressive, yet he also shows some serious balls within structural limits."
3010,"Almost Famous is a stunning, thought - provoking film that comes at you directly from the eye of the camera and hits you with a hard bang. From the acting, brilliantly handled, to the directing, never camrons problem, down to the sets, costumes, audio, and other wonderfully placed visuals. This film skirts between the lines of all those possibilities and somehow manages to find its way to the viewer intact, deftly and with a whole lot of old - fashioned charisma. Almost Famous is realistic, funny, touching, and one of those rare movies that makes you feel like you've gained something just for having seen it. Packed with top class performances all round and great music score Almost Famous delivers, and delivers with attitude and realism that is rarely captured on film."
3011,"Both delivered dynamic and intriguing performances. Monica Keena's character is transformed throughout the film and she's able to convey that arc with great subtlety. The 3 best aspects to this film are the acting, cinematography and soundtrack. A powerful film that deserves much more attenion and credit than what it's getting. Title (Brazil): "" Crime + Castigo "" ("" Crime + Punishment "" )"
3012,"It is a wonderful story, full of surprises and charm. Working from an intricate and insightful screenplay by John Byrum, Paltrow has crafted an engrossing comedy / drama that is entertaining and poignant. It was a nice little story, made into a very fine, charming, stick - to - your memory movie with talent oozing out the corners. All of the cast, including Huey Lewis, Gwyneth Paltrow and Paul Giamaiit to be enjoyable. Personally, the film deserves a slight edge because of the Giamatti / Braugher thing, but altogether, it gets a 6/10."
3014,"****, (four stars out of four) - a shocking, brilliant, and redeeming work of art - The depth, power and heat of Urbania are its real stunning feats. But towards the climax, the film reveals its true colors. The direction, screenplay and style of "" Urbania "" is superb. Dan Futterman is just superb in his role."
3015,"` The Specials' is a direct to DVD release that while short on special features and effects is filled with originality. The Strobe is married to Ms. Indestructible (Paget Brewster), a lady who when not fighting at her husbands sides, spends her day answering the phones and paying the bills at the Special's lair, a simple house in a quiet California residential area. It's absolutely cheeky and self - deprecatory, and shows that superheros are like ordinary people. As a bunch of misfits with only their very mild "" super "" powers and illusions (? ) this is a wonderful movie, but if you're looking for flashy effects and big action scenes, rent a terminator movie."
3016,"Safe within his persona, he thought of himself as a good citizen, an upper class lawyer, someone who deserved the best and had it, a beautiful wife and a beautiful home and so forth. What it is about, is that Hackman, for the entire movie, is convinced that his wife has committed the murders. THE CASTS The characters in GARDE Ã  VUE are better delineated and more incisive than in UNDER SUSPICION, and give more opportunities to the actors: if Hackman is excellent, his character is less complex than Serrault's, who fits his to perfection; Freeman's performance is not one of his bests, while Ventura is outstanding as an inspector who fails to remain objective, and whose future accordingly is bleak; Romi Schneider's delicate features and calculating coldness are perhaps more suited to the story than Monica Bellucci's earthly beauty; Thomas Jane has not much to do, while Guy Marchand's sadistic impersonation earned him a Cesar, the French equivalent of Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. However, less than an hour before the event, Henry is called into the police station by friend Capt Victor Benezet to clarify some points on his statement. Stephen Hopkins' direction is hip, inventive and unstagy (though it must be said that his "" a person can physically visit someone else's flashbacks "" trick had already been done three years earlier, in "" The Ugly ""), the dialogue is sharp, and the story is compelling."
3018,"This is a fun film and has several things going for it. Visuals are below par, except for the gorgeous Ms. Cruz. Despite these strange doings, the film has charm and beautiful, bold colors to it. Though eminently forgettable once you are out of the cinema hall, while inside, it is worth every minute of yours. The film is colorful, filled with wonderful Bossa Nova music, and has enough eye candy to almost make you forget the main dishes!"
3019,"As in his other featured works, von Trier's gritty, hand - held camera work may be dizzying to the point of distraction at first but its overall impact to the stark proceedings is unquestionable. Some of her moments in this film bring you to tears with their absolute honesty. The result of the combination of BjÃ¶rk's phenomenal voice and incredible acting performance was astonishing. He packs all kinds of emotions into 2 hrs. With an incredible closeness to these people, Dancer in the Dark will make you think and stretch your emotions to the limit."
3020,"Best in Show (2000) Directed by Christopher Guest. Best in Show would be on and although she hadn't seen it, she'd heard it got great reviews. The casting in this one is great and even the typically out of place in, uh movies in general Parker Posey does a fine job. Larry Miller turns in a great cameo as one of the countless men in O'Hara's past. The director, writer and star of Best in Show, Christopher Guest, is no newcomer to fake documentaries."
3022,"Zach Braff does an excellent job as does Andrew Keegan, Dean Caine and of course Timothy Olyphant. The script is brilliantly written and sparkles when it is at its peak. A true ensemble cast, ostensibly headed by Timothy Olyphant as Dennis, is only part of what makes this a fine piece of cinematic work. Timothy Olyphant stands out here in an able cast, made up primarily of TV actors. And thanks to a clever, throwaway bit of name - dropping, the movie offers fleeting confirmation - at last!"
3023,"A lot of professional boxers have risen from these circumstances. What makes it better than the sum of its parts though is a strong performance from Rodriguez delivering a down to earth performance that manages to be defensive and vulnerable at the same time, matched by a gritty tone to the direction throughout. There's no giggly ,' everything that can go right does go right' resolution a la "" Bend It Like Beckham "". Quickly improving in the ring despite the hoots of derision aimed at her from her fellow boxers, Diana finds problems with a lack of female opposition, love in the shape of another up and coming amateur and a conflict on the horizon with her father bound to find out sooner or later. First time writer / director Karyn Kusama has done a terrific job of creating a realistic setting for her story, presenting an honest portrait of life in the projects and conveying that desperation so familiar to so many young people who find themselves in dead - end situations and on that road that leads to nowhere."
3024,""" Remember The Titans "" is laced with strong performances from Will Patton, Ryan Hurst, Wood Harris, Donald Faison and Greg Alan Williams. Her talent shines through and her presence on screen is as fresh as the daily air; furthermore, every time she is on screen she sparkles. In 1971, in Alexandria, Virginia, the town's high school football team, the T. C. Williams Titans, are very popular. Denzel Washington, as the coach, gave another of his consistently outstanding performances. But when Coach Boone and Coach Yoast prove that the Titans are a winning team, the issue of race is erased and the true meaning of teamwork is born."
3080,"First, it is very well made, and artistically shot with some highly memorable scenes, such as the one where Will Smith first appears out of the dark. The thing you have to bear in mind when watching The Legend of Bagger Vance is that sports movies, by their very definition, tend to match the atmosphere of the sport they depict. But, for some reason THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE seemed to be one of the better films of that genre. Well you'll be relieved to know that Bagger is a pleasant change of direction for the normal Smith stereotype. The acting was superb (even Smith's subdued Bagger), and the story was interesting."
3049,"Spike Lee's "" Bamboozled "" is certainly an ambitious film. Yet, there were some brilliant scenes. "" Bamboozled "" is clever and one of Spike's most explosive films next to "" Do the Right Thing "" and "" Malcolm X "". "" Bamboozled "" is a well thought, mentally challenging film that'll change your life. The gold chains, oversized sport jerseys, and baseball caps worn sideways are clownish and not far removed from the olden days when blacks played buffoons to entertain white people."
3050,"Digimon is one of those anime series that, while aimed at younger audiences, is actually very enjoyable. Oh well, thank goodness for DVD. Not the Americanised, simplistic anime but a prettier and more detailed style. Except for the previews for several horrible kid movies and an excruciating ten minute Angela Anaconda short, Digimon: The Movie was a great film! As for the Digimon: The Movie it was one of those very few movies, that actually was a great and interesting movie!"
3051,"It has great acting, sharp directing, nice car chase scenes, nice action scenes, some great moments, some wonderful music, a simple yet effective storyline that keeps you guessing and wanting to see more. This film features interesting cinematography, with strange forward jump cuts (ripped off from The Limey), odd angles and the use of colour filters. This is, of course, a good example of Hollywood's cannibalising of the British and European film industries in its endless search for a good story. And as someone put it, crap like XXX, The Fast and The Furious (+ sequel, at least is has some cars), Charlie's Angels (+ sequel. The original film is one of the best English thrillers of all time and despite being made nearly thirty years ago still packs a punch."
3053,"The triumph of this film is that it never overdoes anything. The top notch performances and lively direction also raise the film to a higher level. It makes for more, well - rounded, appealing movie, because how relatable, some of the actions scenes, were. Their moments together are genuinely touching at times, particularly in the film's closing stretches. This film is packed with slick gags, hilarious scenes and it has a really fun story; it's a comedy film that you don't want to miss."
3054,"In Requiem however, it is the mutilation of his life, his whole character, that takes centerstage, ending in a satisfying climax of gargantuan proportions in which he gives the audience more than their money's worth in his power - packed performance. The climactic sequence, where the protagonists are effectively destroyed by their addictions, seemed to trigger a bout of heavy breathing in the audience. Lastly, the direction of Aronofsky, brilliant, beautiful, empathic. the first time in the movie you see real fear in his eyes. She definately deserves her Oscar nomination, if not, the Oscar itself, for her tour - de-force performance."
3055,"Not real historically accurate on many fronts. He uses mainly handheld cameras and delivers a gritty feel to the whole film that is fitting to the material. Waves of four - letter words pound the audience, some in shock of what they are hearing. The plot is the same as "" One flew over the Cuckoos nest "" and "" Cool Hand Luke "", its in GOOD company, and it holds its own. Such thought - provoking ideas are made possible through the heartbreaking performances by the young aspiring actors who portray the various trainees."
3056,"The supporting cast, Kartherine Narducci, Kevin Conway, Matt Servitto, Vincent Pastore, and the rest, are perfect. Full of real characters with real emotions and real conflicts, the movie moves along at a nice pace with some real twists and surprises along the way. This is a wonderful film, that deals with the challenges of ethnic stereotypes and the cultural biases that go with them. Terrific performances (especially from the lead - Michael Rispoli - who can be over the top at times in other films or just give wonderfully layered performances - like on the Sopranos or his work as a priest in The Third Miracle). Ms. MacDonald does good work as Mary."
3057,"The movie succeeds with its accurate and involving performances. This is a very thought - provoking story, full of surprising twists and a meaningful message. Great flick, worthy of a 10 and higher rating than IMDb users have given it. Gary Oldman is perfect with a sly, cunningly cocky and self - confident performance that fits his character extremely well; there is a very real possbility his work will be remembered come Academy Award time. Interlaced with much thought - provoking material and Academy Award worthy performances, "" The Contender "" is one of the best pictures of the year."
3058,"If you dig seeing that dramatized, Dr. T is fairly unique. Enter Dr. T: The Rock of Gibraltar, the only character with more substance than a french fry. When done well, you get the impression of moving through the world with a curious voyeurism, dipping into many lives which are intriguing enough to learn more about. In the best case, the differing visions of the actors add to the manyhued effect described above. E. R. and Hill Street Blues and any number of TV dramas thrive off Altman's formula - which is to pick an interesting locale, drop a ton of characters in, and set them in motion."
3059,"It has everything to a great movie, acting, cinematography, editing, and of course, writing. Leon Phelps is a unique Saturday Night Live creation. Tim Meadows (who serves as co-write on this film) is clearly inspired when playing "" The Ladies Man . "" There are so many inventive moments in this gagorama. In another scene, immediately after a heartfelt kiss with the female lead, he suddenly remembers the name of his would be benefactor, a woman he slept with years ago."
3060,"However, the performances, direction and cinematography are all top notch. The cinematography is top - notch; the excellent camera work explores unusual angle; the cast is magnificent; and the film has not aged after sixteen years. In any case, the movie has a good opening twenty minutes and promises real scary stuff to come. These movies all feature more intelligence, originality and suspense than' Lost Souls' could ever dream of having. The story and direction (by first time director and award winning cinematographer Janusz Kaminski) rachet up the thrills and suspense and arent afraid to offer a downbeat ending."
3070,"But they're all brought to touching and masterful closure in the third act segments. A knockout performance, with some of the most dramatic scenes played out with perfect honesty and realism. There are some great performances here, so let's get to â€˜ em. Quite simply, this is the best British movie in years. For honesty and presence, Jamie Bell as Billy far surpasses Haley Joel Osment's debut in The Sixth Sense."
3071,"None of his wishes are successful because each one has a hitch devised by the cunning Hurley to backfire. The 1967 original, starring Dudley Moor and Peter Cook and directed by Stanley Donen was a droll dark comedy that bombed when it was first released to theatres but has developed a very strong cult following over the years. This new version is a wacky, fast - paced farce that makes up in some giddily amusing moments what it lacks in true wickedness. A cute flick sans slapstick, pratfalls, and jokes, "" Bedazzled "" offers lots of outrageous situations, some sentimental moments, and a whiff of philosophy. Although the basics between this movie and the 1967 classic of the same name are similar, there are so many differences (styles of humor, characters, plot, etc) that comparisons are pointless."
3072,"All the performers are right on. watch it anyway, at least the three leads are good. But it's Hailey Joel Osment's wonderful portrayal that gives "" Pay It Forward "" much of its power. Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt, and the phenomonal Haley Joel Osment once again give performances worthy of Oscars. Spacey is always a guaranteed performance and Hunt has grown as an actress in just the last several years."
3076,"These are the kinds of questions the script toys with, and the result is wildly engaging. However, if you continue to scroll through the reviews with the passage of time, you will notice a rather extraordinary development that occurs. There are also some great scenes that show a level of cinematography that is not evident in the grainy original. Of far greater interest actually is the arc the film traveled in terms of its critical and audience reception. BWP2 has some well architected images that invoke tension by their design."
3077,"With his back against the wall, the usually honest and upright Richards is coaxed into a plan that will put an end to his woes and worries. Ephron seems to enjoy taking these characters, who are just a shade darker than what she's used to, through their paces. She's the sharp one of the bunch, externally charming when she needs to be, but tough as nails on the inside and ready to play hardball as soon as the opportunity presents itself. If you can do that, you might be able to enjoy this for what it is - an unrealistic situation comedy with a couple of surprises and laughs. And Kudrow plays it all beautifully."
3078,"She looks very much like Liv Tyler, minus the famous and luscious Tyler lips. For crying out loud, Jessica ParÃ© deserves better! It examines the false play on media and rising above expectations. Pare is backed by excellent supporting players all associated within the hunger for fame. The great looking Jessica Pare does an excellent job playing the rags to riches to rags supermodel Tina Menzhal, and Dan Aykroyd plays a resturant tycoon who loses everything in his pursuit of Tina."
3079,"But the great thing about that is it was thrown in for laughs and a whole lot of fun. The plot is OK and has some reasonable twists but really the jokes and action move it along. Some of the satire is actually rather smart, and the girls are game for just about anything. The colors in this movie are vivid and fun to view. What really makes the film work is the charisma (& physical charms) of the 3 leading ladies, combined with well - choreographed action sequences and the tongue - in - cheek script."
3081,"This is an epic Sandler piece, and his funniest to date, and is quite possibly the definitive Sandler film. Sandler's best film to date! Sandler simply loves the effect a 1 or 2 - liner has on an audience! There is nothing to not like about this movie, it is virtually non-stop laughs from beginning to end. This was a great film and one of the best films of the year, contrary to what so many others say."
3082,"Brashear is much more complex and grounded, and the issues he faces are life crises, making the part far more challenging. Familiar but triumphant true story set in the 1950s about a man and his determination to defy the odds. The performances are quite good - particularly Goodings'. Other decent performers--Powers Boothe and Hal Holbrook--have even more perfunctory roles. Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) is unquestionably a man of great courage and principle, and his strength of character shines through brightly in this film."
3083,"Tom Sizemore and Carrie - Anne Moss are excellent in their roles. But aside from those problems, the rest is fun. The designs of the ship's interior were a tad cheesy. "" Red Planet "" is a film that has solid special effects, but also a strong story and good characterizations. It allows suspense to be created from the series of crises that spring up on the astronauts and that's a benefit."
3084,"A film about ordinary people, living ordinary lives, all done in a near flawless way. The acting was top - notch, the principles were great and everyone else was cast so perfectly that every second of the film just falls into place. Laura Linney's performance as the somewhat - restrained Sammy is easily her best, and Mark Ruffalo's as Terry is also highly evolved. It's just a really really good film in the style of good films (re: The Sweet Hereafter) that's going the way of the dodo under the weight of these iconoclastic Hollywood heavy hitters (re: Shaymalan et al). this is an absolutely pleasant movie that has no corny moments, the background score is terrific, the acting is brilliant especially laura linney is quite extraordinary."
3087,"1sound and sharp visuals, this was another entertaining Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle. Much of the concept of "" RePet "" is quite amusing. Quite entertaining and even interesting too, which makes it one of the better Arnold movies. This is one of the top ten movies released in the year 2000. The scenery, sets, and background content are all quite well done; as if real thought went into each detail and scene, rather than just throwing a house together, decorating it like a mobile home and a hearty, ""."
3088,"And it all rings true, courtesy of a great script, Roos directing and the engaging performances of the stars. Both of them are extremely charming, have terrific charisma and there are some nice interactions between the two of them. However, Ben and Gwyneth give spirited performances and keep everything afloat. However, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Affleck are surprisingly good and have a nice chemistry, in a good and warm date movie. And Paltrow is absolutely disarming as Abby; gentle and vulnerable to a fault, winsomely charming, and beautifully played."
3089,"The story line was great, a few parts added like the history of the Grinch made it even better. Carrey is simply fantastic as he immerses himself entirely into the character. The romance between the Grinch and Martha May could have been better developed. The original movie has innuendos of the character traits of the stars, however the new movie allows for much more cast / character depth and development. However, it's Christmas and it has a nice message while not totally giving in to syrupy sentiment (thanks again to manic Carrey) and it's just perfect for kids and adults at Christmas time."
3091,"It is a pleasant surprise when a movie meets your expectations; it's a great gift when a movie exceeds them. The movie was very realistic just like the other Rugrats movie The Rugrats Movie. In addition to the usual voices used in the Nickelodeon series the addition of Debbie Reynolds, Susan Sarandon, John Lithgow and Casey Kasem make this film version just that much better. There are ample parodies of other movies (to make the adults laugh - outright), as well as lots of fun for the little ones. The story is a heart warming touching story, the songs that make of the sound track are just fantastic."
3092,"And now she needs one extra puppy (hence 102 Dalmatians) to complete her nefarious scheme this time round. Ben Crompton did a good job as Ewan and thats about the only person that stood out. Unlike its predecessor, which was a live action version of the animated 101 Dalmatians, this version is completely new and original. This film is better than 101 Dalmatians, which in its own right was very good, and both children and adults will enjoy it. The puppies are cute, as always, and some of the laughs are well enjoyable for the kiddies."
3093,"Malena is one of those movies that gets stuck in your mind. Ms. Belucci is perfect for the title role and runs away with the film. Mr. Tornatore brilliantly uses silent stares, pairs of eyes and silly dream sequences with amazing effect. A lot of people in this forum have expressed their views in making "" Malena "" a coming of age film. The two leading actors (Monica Bellucci and Giuseppe Sulfaro) are simply excellent at what they are supposed to convey in this movie."
3094,"Quills is a passionate (and entertaining! ) His subtly is what truly makes his performance great with the many underlying tones he carries. The performances are excellent throughout, and the storyline is will firmly claim and keep your attention. It is, in the face of ` Quills ,' a thought worth pondering. However the entirely convincing, intense, brave, Oscar worthy performances by Michael Caine and Geoffrey Rush make up for that."
3095,"One of the best movies in the past decade. Certain scenes in the movie are really quite striking and powerful. Samuel L. Jackson, like always, did a bang - up job with what the script gave him. Like the squares of a comic strip. These are two of the most powerful pieces of any film score around."
3096,"Everything fits in so darn perfectly. The backdrops, establishing shots look absolutely marvelous. The casting of CTHD is perfect. The lighting of different landscapes and the exquisitly designed costumes all radiate with stunning colour. Here in CTHD, she proves herself as an excellent dramatic actress."
3097,"Wayans seems to have a talent to shine even in the worst movies, however. Better attempts at fantasy film making have been shot on camcorders across the globe in people's back yards. Ridley and Snails are thieves in the underclass of their world. ( 3) The movie constantly rips off from other (better) movies, most notably from the four STAR WARS movies (4) The characters. It's probably best watched with friends, for mst3k reasons."
3098,"But the negotiations were believable for the most part, and the growing attraction between the leads was done nicely. With him in the lead, plus 2 other really good performances, it almost (and almost) seems like there are no flaws. So it's definitely worth seeing, but it's a little slow, and like real life the there is no consistent "" tone "" to the plot twists. It may not be that clever a role but he does ` tough' really well and he helps improve the tension of several scenes. When a film like Proof of Life is based on a true story, there are limits to this."
3099,"and movies are meant to entertain. Along the way, however, it has many almost jaw - dropping scenes and some spectacular mountain scenery which looks great on the sharp DVD transfer. For this viewer, it brought back pleasant memories of climbing in the University holidays around the Southern Alps. Somehow, when it comes to fiction, the clichÃ©s take over, and this film, with some genuinely gorgeous camera - work and impressive stunts, is full of them. Martin Campbell, the same director who did The Mask Of Zorro and Goldeneye, is good at producing eye - popping action scenes."
3108,"The cinematography and performances are fantastic as well. The performances were just as great as Lock Stock, with Jason Statham and Pitt leading the pack. Brad Pitt as "" Mickey O'Neil "" is utterly 110% convincing. Guy Richie's follow up to Lock Stock and Two Smoking barrels is every bit as astonishing as its predecessor. It's true, similarities abound between Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels."
3117,"****** This may contain spoilers ****** It's a superb, well directed and well acted movie! The solutions were simply marvelous: ice skates, volleyball, etc. . The scenery is absolutely breath taking, the special effects are so well done that you don't even realize that there are special effects present. If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. Use your heart to feel what the characters feel."
3110,"A fun, light hearted movie, with moments of comic genius. If you are generally a happy person and can laugh or cry at commercials, then you will enjoy the antics and slapstick of this movie. is definitely one of the funniest. Seann William Scott is the funnier of the two by far. Reminiscent to Beavis and Butthead, they cruise around as two aimless stoners with no real purpose in life but to shibby, shibby, and shibby."
3111,"Kuzco and Pacha are a perfect team. In addition there's a charming dottiness that a merely hip film could never quite capture. It's clever, unpretentious, fast - paced, and - like "" Lilo and Stitch "" - you don't feel that the vision of the film was muddled up by the suits. The movie pace is incredibly high and the music by John Debney and Sting are a real surprise. You've often heard the sales pitch, "" adults will love it, too! """
3112,"It's a terrific performance, through which Harden brings Lee to life, physically and emotionally. It's a stunning moment; Pollock's face fills the screen and you actually see it in his eyes, the exact moment of discovery. For the most parts, however, this little film succeeds. Harris and Harden were both deservedly Oscar - nominated for their work here. Harris's labor of love serves as an auspicious debut for someone who, at this stage, seems just as skilled behind the camera as he is in front of it."
3113,"The supporting cast is full of big stars. This film starts with a very unique, funny idea, and it does not disappoint in terms of how good it can be executed. Because--while there are plenty of laughs to be had (especially early on )--in the end, there is a lot more bite and substance to it than first meets the eye. Nevertheless, Gibson does a good job and is able to produce many a smile with his feminine antics. The film was filled with talented acting, laughs, and lighthearted suspense."
3114,"As far as performances go, Connery makes the most of one of his best roles in years. The way they do this, without the usual twists of self - destruction and miraculous salvation, is both touching and refreshingly real. And it's Connery's superlative performance, through which he conveys the complexities of the character so well, that illuminates the true depth and multi-faceted dimensions of Forrester; it is not only memorable, but worthy of an Oscar. Good performances by Sean Connery and Rob Brown, in the latter's screen debut. With a manner reminiscent of Cuba Gooding Jr. in ` Boyz N the Hood ,' he has a natural acting ability that commands attention, and if his performance here is any indication of his talents (which obviously it must be), then it is safe to say that the cinematic world has certainly just been enriched by his presence."
3115,"And that's the magic of the movies. Overall ,' The Gift' is a resounding success, due mainly to the heart of the film - Cate Blanchett's resonant performance. With consummate skill, Blanchett creates a well rounded character which demonstrates that as an actor, she definitely has a very real ` gift' of her own. There are visual tricks, interesting camera techniques and the fine performances by a very talented cast that propel this story forward. What The Gift benefits from, besides great performances, is tight direction."
3116,"These scenes fill the senses and are virtually transporting; and it is in them that the true poetic nature of Arenas is made manifest. And it proves that beauty can indeed be found in the least likely of places. The cinematography is innovative and excellent, audiences have seen few examples of the photography used in this film. But what really drives it and makes it so compelling, is Bardem's incredible portrayal of Arenas. To say that Bardem's performance was worthy of an Oscar would be an understatement; along with Ed Harris (in ` Pollock'), it was quite simply one of the two best of the year (2000)."
3118,"There two actors were fantastic together! Neither of the parallel lives led by the main character is shown to be flawless. Many thanks to the writers and those that brought it to life. However, in this film she was able to show her great acting talents and also her natural beauty seemed to explode in this picture. The frequent flier miles and first class upgrades, and huge bonuses are all gone but not missed."
3119,"On top of that, you have phenomenal costumes and set with the most lavish colors. There are rich colors and textures, beautifully framed scenes, marvellous costumes. Everything is subtle, but it is so beautifully prepared, thought out, and executed by all. One of the brilliant aspects of casting is the Gillian Anderson pick. With a host of good performances and a rich sense of place you will get emotionally and imaginatively swept up in this world."
3120,"The movie rests solely on Bullock's shoulders, and she delivers. As such, Bullock is allowed to shine from a castlist containing Michael Caine and Ben Bratt. A must see for Bullock fans and a fun watch for most others. Bullock is finally in her element in this flick which sports a lively screeplay, a clever script with lots of "" call backs "", and a good supporting cast. Sandra Bullock's facial expressions, physical comedy, comedic timing, and great lines: Ditto for Michael Caine."
3122,"Of course, there's lot of Cohen stuff in there - odd characters and peculiar gadgets, well - developed plot and magic camerawork. The brothers Coen have woven a tapestry of celluloid and aural delights! The two best examples of that are The Big Lebowski and Fargo. OBWAT is certainly those things, but it also has a heart as big as. Three depression era convicts (George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson) escape a Mississippi chain gang and head off in search of buried treasure that will fund their new lives."
3123,"The other person that deserves high praise is William H. Macy. One can see that Mamet loves his levels--it's the core of his achievement. There are many interesting, memorable quotes. She's winsome and charming, with a directness and vigor that is stunning; and she captures the very essence of Ann--the intelligence and the compassion--and conveys it convincingly to the audience. If you want to see great performances and laugh at good, tasteful humor--you can't go wrong!"
3124,"The cinematography has some beautiful scenes. As Drac movies go, this is a winner. The acting in this movie is wonderful, actors like Johnny Lee Miller, Gerald Gutler, Christopher Plummer, and Omar Epps did fantastic jobs on their roles. Someone on the creative team of this film has a sweet little visual gag in store. The Red Hall - the curtains blowing and the eastern theme music for the desert and cross scenes."
3125,"It was as if they were polar opposites, but yet they were perfectly matched. It's a journey that sees acquaintances come and go, love blossom and the harshness of the world become all too real to such young eyes. Cormac McCarthy's novel, All The Pretty Horses, the first part of his breath - taking Border Trilogy, is one of the most perfect source materials ever written. Finally, Billy Bob did a great job of casting the rest of this film to bring the images and feelings of the time period to light. Damon falls in love with Penelope Cruz and provides some steamy love scenes."
3126,"As someone who remembers the situation well, watching this was a profound experience in more ways than one. Looking at it from today's eyes, "" Thirteen Days "" is a knockout. It's correctly based on facts and the few sacrifices of accuracy are realized in the sense of of dramatic license. Costner was a strong personality that worked well with Greenwood and Steven Culp. "" Thirteen Days "" is a powerful and gripping movie."
3127,"A top notch cast contributes superb performances in "" Traffic . "" Traffic, written by Simon Moore (the writer for the British miniseries, Traffik, upon which this script is based), is superbly crafted and woven. His materials are skillful acting, lively editing, a dynamic music score, and an unflinching camera. The movie is visually stunning, loved the different filters for the three locations. ( Topher Grace from "" That 70's Show "" plays Seth) These three stories are distinguishable visually."
3128,"His performance brings both gravity and vulnerabitlity to this complex character. This has all the makings of a truly great movie but unfortunately is good without being great. Verging on pretentiousness at times, The Claim still manages to pull through as a worthwhile film, largely because it is worth seeing for the bits that work well. Some incredibly emotional scenes were cut short. Great credit is also due to the actors, excellent performances all round."
3129,"Editing by Royinba Onijala is crisp. But of course, this movie reaches far above average thanks to the brilliant performances. his portrayal of director F. W. Murnau is extremely realistic and believable. At the same time, there's a lot of humor, as well as an intriguing glimpse of Berlin in the decadent 1920s. It feels good to see that it's still possible to create movies like this."
3143,"He shows a maturity beyond his years. The performances from every member of the cast (right on down to little David Dorfman) are letter perfect. David Dorfman, is a delight in the film. Excellent job all around, actors and director. PANIC (2000) ** 1/2 William H. Macy, Neve Campbell, Tracey Ullman, Donald Sutherland, John Ritter, Barbara Bain, David Dorfman."
3154,"This is the' transference of guilt' narrative beloved of Hitchcock, one which found its purest expression in' STrangers'. One of the first moments of this movie makes inevitably think of "" Shining "" (1980) by Stanley Kubrick and "" Funny Games "" (1997) by Michael Haneke: an aerial shot which follows a car on the highway. Reviewers have pointed out the film's debt to Hitchcock - why do people always call films which' borrow' the superficials (plot, music, characters, set - pieces etc.) Hitchcockian, when his true inheritors are directors like Godard and Marker? That is a thing to treasure, a movie that knows enough what it is about to offer closure, yet leave your mind free to wander over the relationships and lives of the people you have just watched briefly from a distance, and reflect on possible meanings. Harry charms Michel and pretty soon Harry and his beautiful girlfriend Plum (Sophie Guillemin) are invited along to Michel and Claire's modest holiday house."
3205,"In fact, all the cast is absolutely magnificent and it consists of Paul Guilfoyle, John Torturro, Alan Cumming, Ryan Phillippe and the fabulous Anthony LaPaglia as Fidel Castro. The constellation of excellent actors and actresses is amazing. This is a quirky, constant, light hearted film with some funny bits. The cast is perfect in acting in the style of a 50's movie. All the cast is excellent and wonderful, but Woody Allen is splendorous, as usual, with the best lines."
3197,"While leaving out minor details, it includes many of the prominent aspects of the book's apocalyptic nature, giving it an air of realism. There are certainly plenty of Christian materials worthy enough to be made into movies. The main event of the story is the rapture - where all the "" good "" people are simultaneously taken to heaven by Jesus. the cast is solid; however, the screenplay in both movies gives the actors little opportunity to really stretch themselves. It turns all Christians into caricatures, equally disdained and laughed at by the world despite the fact that there is theological room for a wide diversity of believes within Christian thought and practice."
3199,"Several factors are responsible for making In the Mood for Love a new classic among "" romantic melodramas, "" in the best sense of that term. Like Soderbergh's The Limey, this is a different kind of curio for Kar - Wai; where dialogue and plot are forsaken by mood and composition in order to create a tale of two delicate lives in a seemingly confining emotional stasis. It's sexy without showing everything. A film with sensitivity and understated qualities that is rare in these times of clichÃ©d plots. Second, Christopher Doyle's award - winning, breathtakingly beautiful cinematography creates an environment which not only envelopes its two main characters, but seems to ooze with romantic longing in every one of its sumptuous, meticulously composed frame."
3200,"All the while the uplifting images from under the sky of downtown Los Angeles take you up to another dimension. It sets a high bar for the viewer to care when he leaps. It's a quiet, understated film that finds beauty and grace in very unlikely places. As with a good book, you can embark on a journey through The Million Dollar Hotel - DVD over and over again, as if reading it each time for the first time. Million Dollar Hotel is a beautiful movie, and one of Wenders' best recent efforts, considerably better than The End of Violence or Lisbon Story, but with a smaller worldview than Until the End of the World or Wings of Desire."
3214,"Also the soundtrack is unusually excellent for a documentary. This is a trans - formative film that touches deep and complex emotions. Or perhaps it is the film makers' extraordinary ability to draw from the people involved an honesty and openness which is as impressive as it is devastating to watch. This is an exceptionally well - done and thoughtful documentary on the aftermath of apartheid in South Africa and the rather different "" war crimes "" tribunel approach they took in South Africa. This documentary tells four true stories of apartheid in South Africa."
3215,"Well cast and well written, it was amusing at the right moments, warm at the right moments, awkward at the right moments. The film is a veritable reel of visual and oral quotes, which you must be (like screenwriter Roddy Doyle) a real film fan in order to get them all. Many surprising twists of plot and character that made it that much more interesting. Those that liked his Barrytown Trilogy (The Commitments, The Snapper, The Van) novels or films, will like this as well. If a brilliant screenplay by one of the world's most popular writers needs stars to get it made then the world has indeed gone mad."
3255,"First credit must go to Rob Sitch's absolutely brilliant direction. The performances were great the story was pleasantly refreshing. As is to be expected, the writing here is very sharp - a likeable group of characters are defined very well very quickly, the simple plot flows smoothly, and there is a constant stream of funny (and some downright hilarious) moments. In short, "" The Dish "" is one of those rare movies which will appeal to pretty much everyone. Those looking for a comedy will find many laughs herein."
3256,"The film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of Leonard Shelby, beautifully played by Guy Pierce. There are also some powerful scenes in â€˜ Memento'. The way Leonard tries to remember things in the present and the future, via notes tattoos and photographs, making them an important element within the movie. Showing some of the scenes in chronological order (BTW, the use of B&W instead of color to make the time distinction was ingenious) creates suspense which builds as the two timelines converge. "" Memento "" is an old - fashioned "" film noir "" - type mystery thriller with an intriguing, ingenious twist: outfitting the entire film with a style that mirrors the protagonist's own mental condition while giving the poor viewer (s) his own perspective as well."
3263,"Tobias makes a compelling subject for study as the experiences he faced in immersing himself in these two tribal societies has left him fundamentally changed. The blend of Tobias's daily life with his adventures in Peru really show both sides of the man. Equally important was the loving - and gay - relationship Tobias Schneebaum had with members of the groups he studied as an anthropologist. The juxtaposition of places and footage makes it interesting, and the soundtrack adds to it, but the movie itself comes off as laughable. Even so, Schneebaum himself has moved into a kind of higher innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness."
3266,"Great to see Charizard back, by the way! This is definitely the best of the pokemon films. It contained everything that makes Pokemon great. And even four years later, Pokemon 3 still delivered the thrills. The program is very tolerant of people's differences and celebrates everyone's unique talents."
3270,"Andrew Dominik, the director, did a splendid job. It's a brilliant movie with great direction and performances. Eric Bana gives a great performance in the lead. Bana is a big part of this and he is really good in one of his earliest roles on film. Eric Bana's performance is simply awe inspiring and the supporting characters and performances throughout are believable, convincing and multi-layered."
3271,"This is also a marvellous success for the director Panahi. Panahi did a great job showing the truth. The actresses are all pretty good and most come off pretty natural and convincing, with only the odd moment here and there not really working. Like Mohsen Makhmalbaf and Abbas Kiarostami before him, Jafar Panahi has succeeded in producing a small, but superb film. One feature of the film that is part and parcel of its roving camera approach is that there is very little in the way of exposition or denouement in any of the narrative threads."
3281,"Each single scene is valuable, worth to be seen, contributes a lot to the whole, EUREKA is--despite its sheer enormity--concentrated on the essentials and thus compact. Due to its realistic style, at times Eureka feels like a documentary. The acting here is superb (and not just that of Aoi Miyaki and Koji Yakusho )--and the monochromatic cinematography is equally wonderful. Eureka's plot is a simple, its action, dialog and soundtrack is sparse, camera movement is minimal. Naoki and Kozue though being kids display a true situation that can drive even kids to craziness."
3300,"The movie is, however, well - paced between scenes which are rousing or charming, and those which are raw and painful. The cast, many of whom really are janitors and custodians, are as real as it gets. It's a pleasure to see a movie with good quality production values and excellent acting which was made for a reason, not just to make money. The authenticity with which this story is told is astounding, showing a deep respect for those who in search of a way to make an honest living, subject themselves to countless humiliations and are relegated to live outside the margins of mainstream America. Through coming out from the shadows, and joining the great and messy American experience of organized dissent, you could practically see some of these characters changing into ` Americans' before your eyes, no matter what their official papers might say."
3301,"That's why Dogme is so fantastic. They are raw and real to life each going through there own trials and tribulations. Wonderfully acted and refreshing casual with it's loose style, the human drama and character relationships are immediately captivating. The performances are outstanding and this Dogma 85 film was released in Brazil on VHS by Cult Films Distributor. They just needs to fit in in the Script by Levring and Academy Award winner Anders Thomas Jensen."
3320,"This is without a doubt the best film of 2000, a masterpiece of sublety and understatement. ' Yi Yi' is an exquisite observation of a family in which all the ages are represented at varying stages of life. His middle class family is involved with commerce and careers. Yang may suggest that the majority of people in the big city are like A-Di who has the ambition to make a great deal of money. But, to make a statement about life, you have to illustrate it with lives, and this Yang does exquisitely."
3325,""" Big Eden "" is simple yet elegant. Tim DeKay may be eye candy without a shirt for some, but his character is still grounded in reality and he handles that part quite well. "" Big Eden "" settles in as one of the more' feel good' movies of the year. Louise Fletcher and, particularly, George Coe give wise, restrained performances that lend a touch of class to the silly antics and superficial tendencies of the story. The story keeps its limited sights on the amusing entanglements of the trio, never allowing itself to get overly serious or preachy."
3329,"The costume and make - up designs bring the human stories to warm life; and set against war - torn 1940s backdrops, the production design could hardly go wrong. He and the ensemble cast play every beat of the story just right (there's even one moment midway through where the audience are maybe allowed to get a bit too far ahead of Polivka's character, but it's remedied by the performances). The visual flourishes, especially the effects of switching between film speeds and using a DV tape look, all enhance the narrative without intruding into it, and thus heighten the tension at unexpected moments. It is a much more realistic portrayal of what normal people do during abnormal times than is the ubiquitous American approach, i. e., any American in trying circumstances morphs into a super hero, albeit usually softly spoken, understated, and of course morally beyond reproach. The mix of laugh - out - loud humour, gripping thriller, and finally a well - earned and unsentimental tear - jerker of a last 15 minutes is the zenith of a movie - watching experience."
3349,"Sami Bouajila, as Felix, has camera chemistry and acts well. This is an amazing achievement: it is a realistic feel - good movie: the world and its problems do not disappear into the background. Yet, the natural lighting and choice of shots conveyed the persisting charm of France. That the film succeeds at all is entirely due to Sami Bouajila's utterly likeable Felix. This is a stunning film, thanks to a wonderful naturalistic and warm portrayal of Felix by Sami Bouajila in the title role, stunning supporting cast, a good soundtrack, and some lovely photography."
3350,"Also expect an interesting 89 minutes. This is one of the best movies of 2000, and is highly recommended. Glazer's direction is wonderful as he keeps the viewer engaged throughout the entire 90 minutes and effectively infuses wicked humour and suspense. Suffice to say, the brilliant performances (Ray Winstone and Ian McShane in particular) and the amazingly slick editing make every second of Sexy Beast a kinetic foray into surrealism and a tour de force of epic proportions for Kingsley. These more aggressive sections are beautifully contrasted by the' slower' character building sections, which allow Winstone to display his charm to full affect."
3351,"Sissi, on the other hand, is the driving force that pushes him forward. * The story has several elements that almost everyone will enjoy & although the story may be a little slow in a few parts, it is nonetheless, interesting. A couple of shatteringly good scenes, well thought out, plotted and executed, all rounded out with a black humour and tender touch that keeps it CLEAR of pretension. Tykwer seems to suggest that Bodo and Sissi's entire existence is to affirm each other's life. Their interactions are quiet with bursts of trauma, their eyes do most of the talking."
3353,"Niemans and Kerkerian prevail, of course, but it was the journey that was so satisfying. It was essential to the story, which really had some extremely interesting twists and turns. The thrills keep on coming without having to take resort to loud background music, which make these moments even more rivetting. The French countryside with the spooky houses is a feast for the eyes. Visually utterly beautiful, particularly the College, the Library, and the glacier / ice tunnel scenes."
3354,"Subsequently, among other assignments, he was appointed U. S. Ambassador to Portugal, Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Secretary of Defense, and is now the Chairman of the Carlyle Group. The film is excellently shot with Eriq Ebouaney an excellent Lumumba. The film was sure to specifically implicate the U. S., rightly so, in the murder of Lumumba. The film and life of Lumumba is a lesson of how badly things can go wrong in a climate of conflicting objectives and numerous parties and forces acting in a volatile setting. It might encourage them to find out more about Lumumba or various other things after the credits roll away and that is a good thing."
3358,"It starts well enough, nicely setting up the two main characters with some very well - acted, almost documentary - like scenes. The initial scenes are very realistic, including the horrific rape. Former hardcore actresses Lancaume and Anderson are both terrific in their parts and the sex they have (and, yes, it is' real' sex) enhances their characterizations, rendering them more complete. 0 average makes also clear that most of the people are still filled with tabboos. BAISE - MOI is a rare film that utterly achieves what it sets out to do and it bodes well for debut cinÃ©astes Despentes (author of the sulfurous source novel) and ex-porn star Coralie."
3359,"Even the interiors are visually rich with colors and textures. The fresh, cool colors through the movie really do transport the viewer to somewhere similar to a tropical paradise. The use of colors and imagery of the setting is done in a manner so astonishingly beautiful that one wonders if such a film could be made. A visually - stunning look at the lives of three modern - day Vietnamese sisters and their families, living in Hanoi. Its great to see that movies don't have to either."
3523,"Go beyond that and you have one of the best, most economical pieces of film making in years. But the core, unmissable qualities of a Kitano film remain. Ca nÂ´t await to see Kitano Â´s "" Battle Royale "" - this one must be really brilliant. ' Beat' Takeshi was just brilliant in the role of Aniki. The more emotionally challenging film is, the more noteworthy it becomes and Kitano's films are perfect examples of that."
3527,"A film that you might look at more than once; this is truly the Italian Bagdad CafÃ©. She meets some interesting people and in one way or another she always influences their lives. Director Soldini has crafted and delivered an engaging and thoroughly involving and thoughtful film that grabs hold of the viewer and sweeps you along with it. On second viewing recently, "" Pane e Tulipani "" looks still fresh. In that process, this movie creates great shots and moments that builds the environment and confirms it to a classic comedy."
3584,"The players do a capable enough job getting attuned to the dramatic possibilities. But the Aussies not only took it on but executed it splendidly and sensitively. The performances of Tingwell, Blake and Norris are outstanding, and the scenes of intimacy are tasteful and beautiful. Some of those are lovely: the hazy romance of the engaging, photogenic Kirstien Van Pellicom. That the actors perform as well as they do under the circumstances is a tribute to their skill and professionalism."
3590,"Check out the cameos, they're a hoot. In fact both Tomei and d'Onofrio are close to perfect in these roles. Both Tomei and D'Onofrio turn in excellent performances. The ending was a complete surprise and there were some nice twists. This movie successfully ventures into interesting and largely untested ground."
3591,"The semi-cameo (and slightly camp) performances by Dawn French, Joanna Lumley, Emma Thompson and Rowan Atkinson made for fun entertainment as well. There are quite a few very funny bits, plenty of saucy moments and jokes and some very soapy, sweet bits. In fact much of the plot and the laughs come very much from the sitcom school of writing, albeit of a slightly higher quality. A BBC film this features so many stars of BBC TV comedy that you'd be forgiven for thinking it was a sitcom with high production values. A full cast of 80s alternative comedians makes their appearance, Emma Thompson almost looking identical to her mother in' Saving Grace' in her mad hippie cameo and Dawn French affecting a bizarre Aussie accent as a nurse."
3592,"*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** A warm and big hearted comedy, with poignant, bittersweet overtones. Moodysson has created a film here that is as entertaining as anything you're likely to see and with a definite message. The story is very human and engaging, with many characters very well - developed that find themselves in a world of freedom and without repression, changing their behaviors and improving as human beings. The soundtrack with hits of the 70's is wonderful and another attraction. Lukas Moodysson delivers a film here that works on a multitude of levels."
3620,"Keeping them from self destructing and working towards the common mission was an amazing accomplishment. The scenery is breathtaking, and you get a real feel for how desperate these mens' circumstances really were. The story is one of the most amazing, and harrowing, tales of survival imaginable. Shackelton is portrayed as the excellent leader that he was, but is not presented as an infallible genius. However the chance of gaining acclaim for accomplishing such a feat was enough to get hundreds of men to sign up."
3606,"A stellar performance by Forester, and Donny Wahlberg is a real suprise. Donnie Wahlberg was terrific in it. First time auteur, and diamond business scion, Daniel Cohen, has taken a similar situation of an aging road warrior (brilliantly subtle Robert Forster) and his apprentice (Donnie Wahlberg, with his brother's smiling charm and with NKOTB far behind) and the women they love and leave, and brought forth the shining humanity. Forster is superbly cast, and Wahlberg is delightful. Of course, the chemistry between Robert Forster and Donnie Wahlberg has something to do with it as well."
3607,"For it's fantastic script, three stars. It has been given very good reviews from the Media. The Iron Ladies truly delivers on all accounts. But it does deliver humour and some passable performances and it does NOT cram "" teamwork "" down your throat. Shiriohana Hongsopon gives probably the best performance as Coach Bee, the glue that holds the often hot - tempered and always effervescent team together."
3609,"The plot has some really astonishing surprises, and the taut nearly flawless script (in Spanish) is a treasure. As a document of life in an industrial Andean city which just happens to be the second city of the country poised to become the next Vietnam, or better said, the next El Salvador, La virgen de los sicarios is excellent. The screenplay was incisive, witty and at the same time displayed the depths of the human condition. Occasionally venturing into dreamlike surrealism, the movie mostly hits you with a heavy dose of cinema verite. The digital also helps keep the film grounded--the only really attention - grabbing aspects of the film, as cinema, are the opening and closing framing of very beautiful music, and one nice over-the-wall camera move."
3612,"INTO THE ARMS OF STRANGERS is a documentary that examines the Kindertransport program through the eyes of the participants. True, it's very disturbing, but it's one of the best films ever made about the horrors of war. The film is constructed from interesting and rare film footage and newsreels, German lullabies and folk songs, still photos, letters and drawings, representative objects, but, most importantly the recollections of many Kindertransport children, full of detail and emotion. Mark Jonathan Harris has made a valuable contribution to show the whole world how a mad man changed these children's lives, and their parents' forever. One boy, after being placed with a family in England for 6 or 7 years during WWII, finally got the miracle of meeting his parents again after they had somehow come through the war."
3615,"Danny Aiello is wonderful as usual. This is one of the best films in recent years. It takes so many lives and elements and brings them together with aplomb. Fan a fresh deck of cards with the spots up and the coherence is immediately apparent. Bob Giraldi did an excellent job with his actors, and production designer Andrew Bernard created a stunning atmosphere."
3717,"complemented by a website, comparable to the one for Blair Witch Project, only funnier. It is frequently funny with many illustrations of real wit. Plus, everything comes together for a happy ending. The fictional town of "" Chapparal, Nevada "" is in fact Colfax, California. Garafalo is good, but clearly Jerry Stiller is the laugh - machine here."
3745,"Still, there're a lot of great scenes and set pieces. Highly recommended to oddity fans especially. But overall, it's an extremely watchable film, with good performances by the three principals, and a delightful black comic energy. This film, as like the rest of Svankmajer's work is truly original and unique. It's certainly not the best of it's kind, but it is a hilarious, twisted nightmare of a tale that fans of the genre will likely enjoy."
3781,"And Sara Indrio Jensen is superb! Director Lone Scherfig has directed with a sure hand and the situation is believable. There were just so many moments of geniune warmth and humor. The dogme style goes well with this story. The ensemble cast plays well, as it is with the majority of the Dogme95 films."
3795,"Escaflowne the Movie while visually stunning and aided by an enchanting musical score just seems to fall short of being as epic as it could have been. This is a very dark, but compelling Escaflowne. For those who have seen the Escaflowne television series know that it was a beautifully complex shoujou anime with plenty of action, adventure, and romance. The animation was quite good, and the music, made by the great composer Yoko Kanno it's incredible, but the plot is just average. The soundtrack, once again handled very nicely by Yoko Kanno, is absolutely top - notch and might remind one of the power of John Williams' score to "" Star Wars ""."
3796,"But there are a lot of great moments. Marie - JosÃ©e Croze is very good here. The film does not progress in linear fashion and there are several shifts of time and perspective to keep the viewer on edge. No earth shattering epiphanies here, but still a solid tale done up in many colours. One thing to note is the astonishing camera and lighting work done by young cinematographer AndrÃ© Turpin."
3800,"P. S. Oh, and the superhero scenes are just awesome! It has some drugs, occasional sex (sorry, no nude), and a lot of laughs. This movie sits somewhere between reality and fantasy, for it uses both aspects in a beautiful way, somehow finding a perfect point between the two. It's different cause the film has some neat editing scenes, and goes into some fun philosophical points as Tom describes his non-existence while swimming around the downtown area. The exaggerated personality degradation and hallucinations are funny and successful at drawing the audience into their warped world."
3842,"The illustrative quality is awesome: the colors, the character details, the backgrounds Its full of great moments, but the best is the climactic finale - absolutely unforgettable. It is a beautifully created anime! If you appreciate well - crafted, illustrative animations, don't miss this one. A really compelling and exciting anime piece that delivers all the goods in a marvellous blend."
3899,"At times, the film is reminiscent of Terence Malick's work with the use of narration, beautifully evocative music, and mesmerizing shots of the landscape. David Gordon Green has a pretty simple formula â€“ not a great deal of extraneous camera movement, realistic characters and scenes that are lyrically cut together with beautifully photographed landscapes. The opening scenes in particular have great cinematography. Though at times self - conscious, George Washington brings to mind Terence Malick's Days of Heaven with its voice - over narration, languid, dreamy tone, and gorgeous cinematography. As many people know, this film has great cinematography and the location is an area rarely seen in movies today."
4039,"The recurrent motif of the film, besides the endless triangles, is of frames - there is not a single composition that doesn't give onto other frames: windows, doorways, corridors, elevators, streets, etc. - like a kaleidoscope, the mere switching on of a light can radically reconfigure these spatial arrangements. The narrative consists of connected, but self - contained vignettes or sketches with a recurring set of characters. Directed and written by Roy Anderson, Songs From The Second Floor is a visual and emotional masterpiece. Kalle (Lars Nordh) is the heart and star of this movie. SONGS is a great film that everybody should see."
4041,"When she sees the photo of Lisbeth in the bedroom, she returns to the pianos room where AndrÃ© is and puts her hands on her face exactly the same way Lisbeth did. The performances, particularly that of Isabelle Huppert, are about the only thing to recommend this film. One can even go to the extent of analyzing this by saying that Mika is the black widow and AndrÃ© finds her irresistible. The movie is also fun to watch just for its use of color, clothing, and art as symbols, including allusions to earlier Huppert classics like "" La Dentelliere "". Chabrol turns what would be a situation comedy plot into a compelling thriller about failed relationships."
4176,"Clever script, clever acting, especially by the late Katrin Cartlidge. That took about an hour and 15 minutes, and was an excellent presentation of the story. The ensemble performances are first rate, slightly uneven at times, but generally committed. The performances are pretty good especially Polley as Maren. Rich brings his girlfriend Adaline Gunne (the delicious Elizabeth Hurley), who is a fan of Thomas and tries to seduce him, playing erotic games."
4416,"The characters are definitely amusing (though a bit off), and all of the hang - ups they face along the way just add to the humour. Yes, there are parts of the film which can be quite sad, especially if one can relate in any way to them, but by and large, this is a very funny film that is definitely worth the DVD rental. Although criticized for its violent scenes, BL is actually a highly philosophical study of the various faces of violence, from the off - hand unnecessary (although not gratuitous) violence, to acts of violence accepted by society. The comments here suggest that Danes are somewhat deprecatory about the general quality of Danish films, but most of the Danish films with international distribution in recent years have been truly outstanding. The characterizations are brilliant and the producers deserve a medal for having the courage to attempt a piece so violent (at times) and so utterly human."
4577,"This is one of the best films of recent years. It will take numerous viewings, but is certainly worth it. For some this will deserve multiple viewings, but this is all the better. Haneke's film is a technical tour - de-force, with perfectly sublime performances. co. uk Haneke's masterful look at a modern European city examines exactly what it is like to' exist' in western society."
4651,"A * very * interesting and intricate film, with masterful performances by Nicholas Tse and Wu Bai. Hong Kong filmakers are great experimenters with perspective. Time and Tide is not only one of Tsui Hark's best films, it is also one of the best examples of the entire action genre and should not be missed by anyone. But what it does here is give the characters an anchor that grounds them firmly in reality. Plus, it's directed by Tsui Hark - who has done excellent work with The Legend Of Zu and other such movies."
4661,"The performances from the entire cast are spot - on, and this makes it a very watchable film. Somewhat Christian Slaterish in mannerisms, he contributes strongly to the film's success. The script cleverly uses the changes of teenage years and the changes of the werewolf as one and it works very well on the whole. Superbly handled conclusion with both excellent werewolf effects and the saddest of photographic recollections. And that is why this film leaves most other horror films in its wake - it is multi-dimensional with strong characterizations."
4765,"It is simply amazing to watch how everything plays out. This film does have some comical moments. There are even quite "" realistic "" (even if it is very difficult to judge what can be realistic with such a plot) moments. Intelligent writing, great acting, beautiful locations, and decent effects bring this film together. The cast in this film is chock full of Japanese Stars."
4904,"You know how some movies you can watch and it makes you feel good? Eminem is entertaining (though redundant), so fans might want fast forward to his segments, should they find the movie lying in a gutter somewhere (a likely situation). On the upside, it does have a great many R&B artists. The other rappers are no better, for people who are or were' scared to death by the witch' they seem to find the whole thing remarkably funny, they laugh while describing their' horrible near death experiences'. After a while he would have had a good 30 minutes of comments by rappers, some very famous, about the' hip hop witch', and he figured that knocking together some half plot and releasing the' star studded' film would mean instant success."
4988,"Thats basically as simplistic as it got - he was all things to all people - literally. It is also nice to see the girls who would later become Hollywood's sweethearts, like Jaime Pressly, Katherine Heigl, Emmanuelle Chriqui or Larisa Oleynik. There are a lot of clichÃ©s in this film, but some of the bits in it are funny and sometimes downright interesting (while others really horrible). Some introspective insights into the nature of intimacy were the strengths of the film, while the character of Crick and every story arch related to him were absolutely horrid. Yet because the geek is portrayed as "" sensitive "" every woman in the area falls for this fool (as if guys who think this way aren't a dime a dozen in real life)."
5068,"The performances range from good to excellent; the cinematography is clean and in some cases downright exciting. In its defense, however, it contained very high production values, lavish production design, a stellar cast, and much incredible visual imagery that sticks in the mind. Dune is a spectacular production, aided by some of the best interior sets on screen to date. Most importantly, it's a miniseries that's extremely enjoyable to watch; this isn't an example of slow pretension, but rather a spirited and rousing adventure. Think of Stilgar, the natural born leader, who radiates authority."
5093,"It is a beautiful story of self - exhile, self - determination and giving back. However, the overall impact of the film is powerful, and ultimately it is a film that everyone should see because it's entertaining and informative on many, many levels. Then be thankful you have a warm dry place to live, money to rent movies and a TV and DVD player. It was beautifully shot on B&W film which was impressive considering the lighting issues inside the tunnel. They are lost souls - shadow people moving through an ethereal, timeless landscape."
5222,"Anybody who appreciates a romantic Movie SHOULD SEE IT. There is simmering chemistry between the two leads; the film is most alive when they share a scene - lots! The costumes and sets are alluring, too. Finally found it yesterday 2/13/02 on Lifetime Movie Channel. Takes place in the best locations in New York."
5261,"A really nice and enertaining 93 minutes. Complex systems with seemingly random cause - effect relations are recognized to have very significant levels of emergent organization when seen from different scales. Simply showcasing the budding talent of Audrey Tautou should be enough to generate greater recognition from the cognoscenti. Audrey Tautou is as charming and delightful as she was in Amelie. This movie ,' Happenstance', is squarely about those little things too."
5308,"Touching performances and an intriguing subject matter make for a fine film that Mr. Bythewood should be extremely proud to proclaim his first. All the actors in this movie, even the ones with only a brief amount of screentime, give strong performances. There are some clever bits, like when the writer coins a catchphrase, "" You gotta keep it real! "" If you look at the show, a lot of sitcoms recent and past are skewered. Dancing in September chronicles a year in the life of a TV writer (Nicole Ari Parker) as her show debuts with great success and later becomes another victim of demographics."
5670,"The look of the film is great, with dynamic camera work and beautifully framed scenes. The editing and pace are wonderful, and the music choices are ideal. Great cinematopgrahy, acting and story line. For someone to write, direct, and act successfully in a movie shows a great talent at work. The film is made more enjoyable by Mortiz Bleibtreu's work in it."
5672,"It was a visual delight with fantastic effects and locations. Kimberly Williams and John Larroquette shine! The scenery and costumes were great. It is entertaining for kids and adults, that's it. As a complete story it is never boring and that is quite impressive for something over 400 minutes long."
5673,"Enjoy the movie on Netflix then get it on DVD if you want, or if you don't like it you don't have to watch it again but it is a good movie for kids (mainly tweens) And if you like it you can watch goof troop or the first movie. "" A Goofy Movie "", a 1995 animated flick, was the first full - length movie for Goofy, one of Disney's famous cartoon characters, and it was released over sixty years after the character was first introduced. Max moves out to the college campus with his two friends, P. J. and Bobby, with plans to make the top team at the X-Games. The Goofy movies are a great modern story with the timeless Goofy. The gammas are all about winning at any cost and not above cheating to accomplish that."
5677,"While this film about gay men who were persecuted and imprisoned under the Nazi regime, is in many respects absorbing, the film ultimately suffers from an overly narrow and constricted focus. The stories are real, the people are real, and the emotions which are displayed and which will be brought forth in you, are real. hearing the man who saw his best friend eaten by German Shepards. In this respect, Epstein and Friedman should be largely commended for bringing this subject to the attention of the world, and telling these powerful personal stories before the last survivors die. The extra material added to the interviews is perfectly balanced to put the interviews in their historical and personal context, without unduly expanding the context to overshadow what the (very few) survivors had to tell."
5687,"East is East was good, Bend it Like Beckham was predictable, but Jalla Jalla was really good. is about change: grandma is still firmly rooted in the old ways, dad keeps up appearances but turns out more flexible than you thought and Roro is, for all intents and purposes, just as much a modern Swede as a Lebanese. It took 30 days to shoot the film, and technically the film is very great as there are many different techniques used by the director and the story is also very interesting, and genuinely funny, not some stupid slapstick comedy. The actors are mostly young people, like 1978 - 1982, and couple of older, too, but they all are very talented and natural. Little known Fares has made an intelligent and very funny film."
5678,"New' evidence' has been discovered, and perhaps the real killer still walks the streets, and it's clear who Berlinger and Sinofsky believes it to be. It's a double helix in which both sides (the courts and the suspects) simultaneously mutually admit their guilt AND win their freedom from accusations. Harrowing, provocatively - intense and emotionally - charged documentary about the ever so fascinating but disturbing Robin Hood Hills murders case. The three people behind the website are shown at numerous points in the film accepting collect calls from prison from Damien Echols and holding a live, somewhat informal chat through their website. In one scene he goes as far as setting up fake graves for Baldwin, Echols, and Misskelley Jr. and proceeds to douse the graves with lighter fluid before striking a match and incinerating it all."
5679,"An interesting film raising intriguing questions. This film is certainly enlightening for anyone willing to learn. The surgeon told the parents that their son would hear. The film was interesting, but it did not come close to looking at many of the important issues of the Deaf World and CI. She is content to take from the Deaf world as an interpreter, but she is also willing to insult it when her own child is born deaf."
5681,"The plot is really clever and the gore scenes are really funny as the film doesn't takes itself too seriously. Everything is better connected and well explained, the vibe is much creepier. The characters are likeable and there is enough shocking surprises to satisfy fans of Japanese horror. "" Uzumaki "" is wonderfully photographed and the use of colors is top - notch. Of all the shapes they could have used (square, triangle, trapezoid, rectangle) this was one of the best choices."
5682,"Others should have a lot of fun. to be one of the best moments in the entire series. Daria is a high schooler who is both very bright and very cognizant that many of her contemporaries are idiots. A neat subplot deals with Quinn, Daria's sister, and how she learns she has more depth and more intelligence than she may have once realized. Daria opens up so far as relationships, but by far the best point is Jane's convictions of who she is and the fact that no one is going to change her mind."
5685,"This is a wonderfully crafted masterpiece that evokes the strongest emotions in a person's heart. JSA was a controversial success in Korea. Beautifully filmed, with flashbacks and varied points - of - view, this puzzle movie eventually comes together, offering some of its best moments toward the end. A compelling and moving work in its own right, JSA makes something haunting and memorable out of a situation which, in outline, could easily have proved propagandist and dull. Only a photograph but conveys so much meaning and emotions."
5688,"But the real treat you get watching this is Nachtergale's performance as Joao Grilo. One of the best Brazilian movies ever. It says that the Brazil can do great comedies. Now add the most intelligent and splendid humor and the most talented performances of the always great Selton Melo and the phenomenon Matheus Nachtergaele. The adaptation is efficient, departing very little from Cabral de Mello Neto's text and mood, the direction, scenography and art direction are beautiful, the humour is well balanced with adventure and drama, everything works well."
5689,"The movie finishes on a note, like most anime's do, which leaves you hanging. The reasons it is impressive is. "" Blood: The Last Vampire "" is impressive and not impressive for a number of reasons. As it stands Blood is great and frustrating in totally equal parts . > An anime film with good animation only is not a good anime film."
5873,"With' 0' the style is more polished, with swooping camera moves and clearer, more stylised lighting. A great prequel to the Ringu series. This is a strong entry in the Ringu series, more of a psychological drama than anything else. Director Norio Tsuruta delivers a consistent, suspenseful shocker with plenty of visual flourishes and interesting ideas. The acting is first rate, especially from Yukie Nakama who gives a subtle performance as Sadako, and everyone else is on form."
6133,"Spera was able to relay Hall's vision in a manner that was both entertaining and touching. This is the comedy that beats all comedies. The movie alone beats anything Robin Williams, Jim Carrey, Adam Sandler, or Chris Rock have ever done. But it turns out that this Leprechaun is the funniest, best - written one yet. Well, it's funny, and a fun way to spend a Friday Night with friends who do not take everything seriously."
6856,"At 3 hrs (vs the uncut 4), it's just right - not much lost, & a whole lot better than the 2 hr versions. There are bits of action unique to this production that will make you catch your breath. By the time he examines Yorick's skull, he has grown the beginnings of a beard and comes off wiser and stronger. Anyone who likes Shakespeare's work will love this version. But only a honest film and this fact is not a error of director or actors, fruit of clichÃ©s but element of special dross."
6876,"His opening and closing statements were very good though. He brings great power to numerous scenes using various camera angles. The direction by Yves Simoneau is excellent and rises well above his mostly TV credits. There was some very interesting compromises and trade offs made behind the scenes which could have been worth inclusion. The locations were perfect, with the reconstruction of a bombed - out Nuremberg as well as the courtroom being absolutely perfect."
6992,"Herzog constructs haunting little moments throughout the film. This is not all Herzog's doing - Juliane's descriptions of the crash, for instance, have a startling poetic beauty that transcends or transforms a horrific reality into something Other. Lansa Flight 508 leaves Lima airport bound for Pucallpa, a town in the Amazon rain - forest. The film contains the usual enigmatic Herzogian touches like his poetic narration and strange detours. For instance, his intrusive commentary, often breaking in on the ostensible subject's account; the concomitant imposing of his own concerns onto another's experience; his stylising' realistic' subject matter as he tries to create dream - like effects or utter mystical prognostications."
7003,"The outfits where wonderful and any person watching this movie will definitely keep a smile on their face through the entire movie. Also, having friends in show biz who worked with and knew him well, this is a movie about somebody else! The movie showed a fully fleshed out Little Richard without neglecting to fill the show with lots of great music. Although the movie is a little long, it keeps your attention with the personality and outfits of Little Richard in mind. All the music is by Little Richard, so it rocks a tight lipsync on every song."
7410,"America is definitely portrayed from Danila's eyes. The beauty of the movie is that Danila is not played by Arnold, Vin Diesel or Tom Cruise. Anyways, highly recommend the movie, thumbs up. Seeing America through Balabonov's eyes is an nice reminder of where popular American values stand. Danila and his brother are great characters."
8348,"It's a good parody of a lot of this bad teenage horror movies. Both have unique sense of humor, it just a shame that SIYKWIDLFtT will only be seen by a few and sadly be wrongly branded as a rip - off just because of circumstance and bad timining. The acting is decent enough, though none of the stars stand out that much. which made it a laugh - a-minute ride. Those movies are just for a thrill and this one is just for fun."
8534,"A big budget film its not, but based on the circumstances, they did a good job. Oh, and the gay couple who are the main characters are really hot. The kids are actually decent actors and, at times, out - act the adults. The story isn't all bad, it does take some very real turns such as the couple breaking up briefly. Well, you could get Get Your Stuff, a cute film about the good times and bad times that might happen if you mix the two mismatched ingredients above."
